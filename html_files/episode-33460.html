<p> The superheroes are friends again.</p>
<p> Let's get out of here.</p>
<p> We can't leave before the post-credits sequence.</p>
<p> Why does Jeremy Renner need two assistants?</p>
<p> Shh.</p>
<p> Here comes the sequence.</p>
<p> The Avengers were too strong for us, my Lord.</p>
<p> - [BART AND LISA GASP]</p>
<p> - What?</p>
<p> Who's that?</p>
<p> That's Spider-Man's Uncle Ben.</p>
<p> He was alive the whole time.</p>
<p> And evil.</p>
<p> With great power, comes no responsibility.</p>
<p> [EVIL LAUGH]</p>
<p> Finally.</p>
<p> What?</p>
<p> You saw it.</p>
<p> That was a mid-credit scene.</p>
<p> There's more.</p>
<p> Who the hell are you?</p>
<p> I'm assembling a team of the best team assemblers in the world.</p>
<p> And I want you to help me put together that team.</p>
<p> Assemblers assemble!</p>
<p> [GRUNTING]</p>
<p>: Time.</p>
<p> To.</p>
<p> Go.</p>
<p> But there's two more credit sequences.</p>
<p> When I was a kid, movies ended when they ended.</p>
<p> The only reason you stayed for the credits was to see who sang &quot;The Power of Love.</p>
<p> &quot; And it was usually Huey Lewis.</p>
<p> I liked the first post-credit sequence the best.</p>
<p> I liked the fifth.</p>
<p> Pipe down.</p>
<p> I'm trying to listen to preseason minor league baseball.</p>
<p> ANNOUNCER: And with the last of the Isotopes pitchers receiving Tommy John surgery on the mound, that's the ball game.</p>
<p> Good night, everybody.</p>
<p> [HORNS HONKING]</p>
<p> Stupid baseball traffic.</p>
<p> I'm taking a shortcut home.</p>
<p> [WHOOPS]</p>
<p> Kids, look.</p>
<p> We used to live here before we were married.</p>
<p> It's the old Beef Rendering District.</p>
<p> Ah, yes, Tallow-town.</p>
<p> At the end of every factory tour, they gave you a free glass of bl*od.</p>
<p> Huh, it's really gentrified.</p>
<p> Oh, a store where you grind and flavor your own house made toothpaste.</p>
<p> Ooh.</p>
<p> [SMACKS LIPS]</p>
<p> Mmm.</p>
<p> Terrible.</p>
<p> [GASPS]</p>
<p> There's our old building.</p>
<p> Look.</p>
<p> Our fifth floor walk-up apartment.</p>
<p> [LAUGHS]</p>
<p> Dad, you walked up five floors every day?</p>
<p> No.</p>
<p> I took the elevator to the top of the building next door, then crawled across a plank to our roof.</p>
<p> Hey!</p>
<p> I pioneered that trail!</p>
<p> Yeah, great.</p>
<p> Thank you, Kit Carson.</p>
<p> Kids, you want to check out our old apartment?</p>
<p> Huh?</p>
<p> Huh?</p>
<p> I can tell from your tone that we're going either way.</p>
<p> I have one tone.</p>
<p> Hi.</p>
<p> You don't know me, but I'm Marge Simpson.</p>
<p> Oh, yeah, I recognize that name.</p>
<p> In fact, we still get mail for you.</p>
<p> MARGE: Mm.</p>
<p> Ooh.</p>
<p> [LAUGHS]</p>
<p> Aw.</p>
<p> Oh, thank God.</p>
<p> A list of 101 new choking hazards.</p>
<p> [GASPS]</p>
<p> Pacifiers?</p>
<p> [MARGE GROANS]</p>
<p> [GASPING]</p>
<p> No!</p>
<p> No.</p>
<p> Maggie!</p>
<p> [GROANS]</p>
<p> Oh, here.</p>
<p> So can I get you anything?</p>
<p> Weed?</p>
<p> Edibles?</p>
<p> Pudding with a joint in the center?</p>
<p> But we need you out by 7:00.</p>
<p> We Airbnb this place every night while we stay at a cheaper Airbnb.</p>
<p> Mmm.</p>
<p> Disruptive.</p>
<p> Before Homer and I got married, we had amazing times here.</p>
<p> [CHUCKLES]</p>
<p> Yeah, right.</p>
<p> Like you could possibly ever have fun without us.</p>
<p> It was a wonderful time.</p>
<p> - We were living the DINK life.</p>
<p> - Dink?</p>
<p> - DINK: dual income, no kids.</p>
<p> - Oh, DINK.</p>
<p> How come you can say dink when you're talking about your jobs, but I can't say dink when I'm talking about my dingus.</p>
<p> Before we had you, life was a breeze.</p>
<p> We'd go to amusement parks without going on those stupid baby rides.</p>
<p> Squeezing my butt into a little biplane that only goes four feet off the ground.</p>
<p> Actually, Dad, it's supposed to go 12 feet off the ground.</p>
<p> - D'oh!</p>
<p> - It was a great life.</p>
<p> We were swimming in DINKs.</p>
<p> [LAUGHS]</p>
<p> See?</p>
<p> That was the key to their happiness no kids.</p>
<p> We've been talking about starting a family, but we're just not sure we're ready.</p>
<p> We can't even agree on what to name our ferret.</p>
<p> Yeah, we both like Caitlin, but we just, we can't agree on the spelling.</p>
<p> Well, we used to be just like you.</p>
<p> Childless and partying every night.</p>
<p> [&quot;SWAMP BY TALKING HEADS PLAYS]</p>
<p> Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi Hi Hey, check out who crashed the party, Kent Brockman.</p>
<p> Ooh, he does the animal adoption segment on Thursday mornings.</p>
<p> Eh?</p>
<p> Eh?</p>
<p> [CHUCKLING]: Yes, the biggest problem with winning a local Humane Society Golden Pig Ear - is just staying humble.</p>
<p> - [CAMERA CLICKS]</p>
<p> This celebrity sighting will be the lede for my gossip column, &quot;Marge Madness.</p>
<p> &quot; - Hmm.</p>
<p> - Ow.</p>
<p> What are you doing?</p>
<p> There isn't even a dartboard.</p>
<p> You're Marge Bouvier?</p>
<p> Oh, I read your listings every week correct dates, very few typos, professional stuff.</p>
<p> - Mm.</p>
<p> - Just steer clear of pet shelters and fun runs, those are my b*at.</p>
<p> Mr.</p>
<p> Brockman, you're hurting my arm.</p>
<p> Oh, I'm sorry.</p>
<p> I just care about soft news so much.</p>
<p> HOMER: I had a job at a cutting edge new company that would change the world.</p>
<p> Homer, next week we finally take our revolutionary teeth whitening strips to market.</p>
<p> I couldn't have done it without you, man.</p>
<p> Together, we make an amazing team.</p>
<p> Me, with my advanced degrees in medicine, chemistry and business, and you, with your gentle good humor.</p>
<p> [CHUCKLES]</p>
<p> I hear that.</p>
<p> [LAUGHS]: I love it.</p>
<p> It's like I know you're not listening to me, but I'm not mad at you.</p>
<p> - I'm sorry, what?</p>
<p> - Exactly.</p>
<p> Buddy, whatever I make, you get a piece of.</p>
<p> I hear that.</p>
<p> I mean, I really hear that.</p>
<p> MARGE: Homer took me to the hippest spots in town.</p>
<p> [WHOOPING, WHISTLING]</p>
<p> Oh, Homie.</p>
<p> This is the happiest I've ever been in my life.</p>
<p> Hold onto it, Marge.</p>
<p> Hold on and never let go.</p>
<p> - The moment?</p>
<p> - No, the rail!</p>
<p> [SHOUTS]</p>
<p> [GRUNTING]</p>
<p> - Oh, quit resting.</p>
<p> - [YELPS]</p>
<p> MARGE: We'd see classic movies whenever we wanted.</p>
<p> [&quot;THE TIME HAS COME TODAY&quot; BY THE CHAMBERS BROTHERS PLAYS]</p>
<p> The time has come today Young hearts can go their way Can't put it off another day I don't care what others say They say we don't listen, anyway The time has come today Time.</p>
<p> [BOTH MOANING]</p>
<p> Hey, some of us are trying to enjoy the movie.</p>
<p> No, none of us are.</p>
<p> At least I died before I'm 30!</p>
<p> Yes, he was 47 when he made this film.</p>
<p> Did you two lovebirds-a know there's a meteor shower tonight?</p>
<p> Homie.</p>
<p> We should drive to the desert and watch it.</p>
<p> What about the kids?</p>
<p> Oh, right, we have none.</p>
<p> [CHUCKLES]</p>
<p> BART: So why can't you do stuff like that now?</p>
<p> Why do you think?</p>
<p> It couldn't be me, Booze 'n' snooze.</p>
<p> Why you little [GRUNTS]</p>
<p> - [GAGS]</p>
<p> - Marge!</p>
<p> Pick up the narrative!</p>
<p> [GRUNTS]</p>
<p> MARGE: We were having the time of our lives.</p>
<p> [BOTH LAUGHING]</p>
<p> [HOMER LAUGHS LOUDER]</p>
<p> HOMER: And then it came.</p>
<p> Have some num-num.</p>
<p> Who likes num-num?</p>
<p> You like num-num?</p>
<p> Oh, there's a meteor shower tonight.</p>
<p> We'll do the next one.</p>
<p> It's in 187 years.</p>
<p> Where are they coming from, outer space?</p>
<p> Have some num-num.</p>
<p> Who likes num-num?</p>
<p> You like num-num?</p>
<p> [SIGHS]</p>
<p> Where did this beautiful man go?</p>
<p> LISA: Dad, I know it was fun to be young and free, but how could you ever replace us?</p>
<p> Pool table, jukebox, and a vacation to Bermuda.</p>
<p> Dad!</p>
<p> Can you please get to the part where you reassure us how glad you are we're here?</p>
<p> Hey, as long as I'm the pool table, I'm cool.</p>
<p> Sweetie, I treasure you.</p>
<p> - [GRUMBLES]</p>
<p> - But before you kids, I used to know the names of people in bands!</p>
<p> And not just the singer, but the guitar guy!</p>
<p> And baby Bart was the worst son of a bitch you could imagine.</p>
<p> MARGE: We were the first of our friends to have a baby, so we got lots of attention.</p>
<p> - Aw.</p>
<p> - Aw.</p>
<p> Aw, hey, little man.</p>
<p> Up high.</p>
<p> Down low.</p>
<p> Too slow.</p>
<p> [CHUCKLES]</p>
<p> [CHUCKLES]: Again!</p>
<p> All right.</p>
<p> Up high.</p>
<p> [CHUCKLES]</p>
<p> [YELLS]</p>
<p> Oh!</p>
<p> Ow!</p>
<p> What was that?!</p>
<p> Oh, that's tangelo!</p>
<p> Come on!</p>
<p> That's the most acidic of all the citrus fruits!</p>
<p> I see now that even babies don't respect you.</p>
<p> Were you planning on bringing this brat to board game night?</p>
<p> Oh, sea salt!</p>
<p> The biggest crystals of all!</p>
<p> [GROANS LOUDLY]</p>
<p> We don't have a sitter.</p>
<p> Invitation rescinded!</p>
<p> HOMER: Next, baby Bart ruined my one sh*t at success, my only fast pass to cash mountain.</p>
<p> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p> You won't be sorry.</p>
<p> We're goin' places, Homer.</p>
<p> Soon you'll be in a higher tax bracket.</p>
<p> - D'oh!</p>
<p> - [LAUGHS]</p>
<p> - [BART GRUMBLES]</p>
<p> - What's that thing on your shoulder?</p>
<p> Uh, my son.</p>
<p> You can't have a kid.</p>
<p> But I have a kid.</p>
<p> A kid indicates you took time away from me to conceive.</p>
<p> It's like a virus.</p>
<p> It starts spreading, and suddenly everyone's getting married when they should be working.</p>
<p> Working.</p>
<p> Always working.</p>
<p> [INHALES SHARPLY]</p>
<p> Ooh.</p>
<p> I have a difficult choice here.</p>
<p> You chose me over money?</p>
<p> [GRUNTS]</p>
<p> Ooh!</p>
<p> I deserved that.</p>
<p> And that.</p>
<p> Now he's worth $10 billion.</p>
<p> I still have his phone number, but I've never called it.</p>
<p> Well, why not?</p>
<p> He loved you before.</p>
<p> You're the same guy.</p>
<p> Yeah!</p>
<p> [PHONE BEEPING]</p>
<p> ROSS: Homer Simpson?</p>
<p> Buddy, is that you?</p>
<p> I've been expecting this call for years.</p>
<p> You remember me?</p>
<p> Of course.</p>
<p> I've been waiting to say something to you.</p>
<p> Are you ready?</p>
<p> I sure am.</p>
<p> ROSS: Good-bye forever.</p>
<p> Oh.</p>
<p> Closure is supposed to be a good thing.</p>
<p> Also, I'm afraid, a newborn and a journalism career did not mix.</p>
<p> This is terrible!</p>
<p> I wanted quotes from the swing set, not price quotes on swing sets.</p>
<p> Party pics, not potty tips.</p>
<p> Glitterati, not babysitterati.</p>
<p> Are you getting my drift or should I throw you an oar?</p>
<p> It's important for new parents to know this stuff.</p>
<p> New parents?</p>
<p> Eh.</p>
<p> They're not the audience for the Leisure Section.</p>
<p> All they care about are babies.</p>
<p> Babies are boring.</p>
<p> I'd rather talk about soccer.</p>
<p> And I hate soccer!</p>
<p> Marge, do you like bacon?</p>
<p> Yes, ac Well, you got one last chance to save yours.</p>
<p> Get me a good nightlife story, or I'm replacing you with someone with a nightlife, Barbara Rellalinsky!</p>
<p> I will get the scoop.</p>
<p> MARGE: So, you've moved into painting giant schnozzes.</p>
<p> Marge, the mouth has had its say.</p>
<p> Now it's time to find out what the nose knows.</p>
<p> That's a pull-quote, if ever I heard one.</p>
<p> Pretty much everything I say is quotable.</p>
<p> Well, not that.</p>
<p> [CRYING]</p>
<p> [QUIETLY]: What are you doing here?</p>
<p> I'm so sorry, sweetie.</p>
<p> I know it's my night to watch Bart, but he just won't stop fussing.</p>
<p> Did you try driving around to make him fall asleep?</p>
<p> It only worked on me.</p>
<p> - [TIRES SCREECH]</p>

<p> It's not art anymore!</p>
<p> It's a misshapen lump on the floor!</p>
<p> Not like this masterpiece!</p>
<p> Marge, this photo is dynamite!</p>
<p> Thank you!</p>
<p> Dynamite k*ll people!</p>
<p> Thanks to your kid, we just lost all our art advertising, the art gallery and Art's Deli, which catered the event.</p>
<p> You're fired!</p>
<p> Turn in your press card and your fedora!</p>
<p> And I'm gonna erase your name from this birthday card - we got for Doris.</p>

<p> See?</p>
<p> It's gone!</p>
<p> She won't miss it.</p>
<p> She never liked you.</p>
<p> MARGE: But I still had the greatest job in the world, I THOUGHT: being a mom.</p>
<p> Boy, if it wasn't for naptime, we'd have all been dead from the stress years ago.</p>
<p> - [CLATTERING]</p>
<p> - [TODDLERS CRYING]</p>
<p> I didn't do it.</p>
<p> You are banned forever from Gymdandee; our sister shops, Swimdandee and Violindandee; and all other Kid Kennel enrichment centers and baby prisons.</p>
<p> [SIGHS HEAVILY]</p>
<p> Hey, Homer.</p>
<p> Haven't seen you in a while.</p>
<p> I switched to donuts.</p>
<p> [GASPS]</p>
<p> Oy.</p>
<p> MARGE: Our dream life crumbling, Homie and I sought counseling at the church.</p>
<p> [ORGAN PLAYING]</p>
<p> You were so very wise to bring your problems here.</p>
<p> Now, won't you bow your heads and watch this video.</p>
<p> [b*at MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
<p> [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
<p> Hello.</p>
<p> I'm Professor Thernstrom, author of Fractured Families and How to Heal Them.</p>
<p> [SCOFFS]</p>
<p> I think we all know who Professor Thernstrom is.</p>
<p> Play the video.</p>
<p> THERNSTROM: Jane was an only child.</p>
<p> And science has proven that only children are lonely children and lonely children are evil children.</p>
<p> [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
<p> Jane's problems became the family's problems.</p>
<p> [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
<p> They came to see me, and, nine months later, Joe was born, and all was well.</p>
<p> ANNOUNCER: Do not undertake procreation alone.</p>
<p> WARNING: second child may cause loss of money, limited vacations, and reduced sleep.</p>
<p> Do not have a second child if you have heart problems, are pregnant, or want to keep your spare bedroom.</p>
<p> In rare cases, sibling rivalry may occur.</p>
<p> That's it, Homie!</p>
<p> That's the answer!</p>
<p> We're having another child.</p>
<p> But just the one.</p>
<p> We're not Catholics.</p>
<p> And so we decided to have Lisa.</p>
<p> That's what this was building to?</p>
<p> I thought this was the story of how we got our furnace.</p>
<p> Who would care how we got the furnace?</p>
<p> I would care.</p>
<p> It came with the house.</p>
<p> Mystery solved!</p>
<p> Finally, he's asleep.</p>
<p> Let's make another.</p>
<p> - Mmm, mmm.</p>
<p> - No.</p>
<p> Oh, not here.</p>
<p> He might wake up.</p>
<p> The only safe place is out on the fire escape.</p>
<p> What if firemen need it?</p>
<p> I'll be quick.</p>
<p> [WHOOPS]</p>
<p> Now Mother Nature does the rest.</p>
<p> [ALL WHOOPING]</p>
<p> Hmm [CLANGING]</p>
<p> Duh, girls don't like me.</p>
<p> [PLAYING SULTRY SONG]</p>
<p> Hey!</p>
<p> No fair!</p>
<p> Hey, where did he get those glasses?</p>
<p> The saxophone makes sense, but the glasses don't?</p>
<p> Shut up, you!</p>
<p> - [GRUNTING]</p>
<p> - Shut up!</p>
<p> MARGE: And so after a lot of late-night ice cream and pickles, Lisa was born.</p>
<p> And the best part was Bart became the calmest boy in the whole world.</p>
<p> HOMER: More or less.</p>
<p> Why, you [BLISSFULLY]: you delightful little blessing.</p>
<p> [GIGGLING]</p>
<p> Someone's gonna need four months of rehab.</p>
<p> Not covered by insurance.</p>
<p> [LAUGHING]</p>
<p> So a family with kids is a different kind of happy, but still happy.</p>
<p> Wow.</p>
<p> Just, uh [EXHALES]</p>
<p> wow.</p>
<p> Hey, where's your wife?</p>
<p> Uh, she left me forever during your story.</p>
<p> If you look out the window, you can probably see her.</p>
<p> [GASPS]</p>
<p> Oh.</p>
<p> Why did you leave?!</p>
<p> Because I never want to be stuck with people like you who stunt each other's growth with your rampant dysfunction!</p>
<p> [QUIETLY]: Quick.</p>
<p> Family smile.</p>
<p> Our lives are great!</p>
<p> We left out the happy parts because they were boring!</p>
<p> Nothing wrong with this picture.</p>
<p> [TIRES SCREECH, BRAKES HISS]</p>
<p> Get over here, Lisa.</p>
<p> The only way humanity survives is if people perpetuate this lie.</p>
<p> Well, why is she frowning?</p>
<p> Is there some unhappiness you're hiding?</p>
<p> Um I'm gonna stake my whole marriage on what you do next!</p>
<p> Smile.</p>
<p> Don't be a dink.</p>
<p> Mm I love you, Miles!</p>
<p> [BRAKES HISS]</p>
<p> You did it, sweetie.</p>
<p> You saved two bad marriages.</p>
<p> What's the first bad marriage?</p>
<p> Uh, I miscounted.</p>
<p> You saved one bad marriage.</p>
<p> Just one.</p>
<p> [GRUNTING]</p>
<p> Aw, reminds me of the first time we hugged.</p>
<p> Great story.</p>
<p> Get out.</p>
<p> Well, we may not be ethical, but we're a great team.</p>
<p> Just like Fred and Ethical.</p>
<p> LISA: Want to tell us how Maggie was born?</p>
<p> HOMER: We told you that story.</p>
<p> - LISA: And how we got the dog?</p>
<p> - HOMER: Found him at Christmas.</p>
<p> - LISA: And the origin of the cat?</p>
<p> - HOMER: Nobody cares.</p>
<p> This was a nice idea, Homie.</p>
<p> [SIGHS]</p>
<p> I'm glad we came back here.</p>
<p> Just the two of us.</p>
<p> - [HONKING]</p>
<p> - [BARKING]</p>
<p> [SCOFFS]</p>
<p> Just imagine what they'd do if Grampa wasn't watching them.</p>
<p> - I wish I'd never had kids.</p>
<p> - [GRUNTING]</p>
<p> Thank God there's no munitions left in the factory.</p>
<p> Never too late for another!</p>
<p> No one's made it out in a half century!</p>
<p> I didn't even know there were five of us!</p>
<p> [ALL EXCLAIMING]</p>
<p> Make room!</p>
<p> What the?</p>
<p> How did you get in here?</p>
<p> Mind your own business.</p>
