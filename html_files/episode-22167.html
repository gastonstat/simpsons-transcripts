<p>[ALL SHOUTING THEN GRUNTING]</p>
<p>Before we begin, may I remind you, school computers are not to be used... to access PrincipalSkinnerStinks.com, SkinnerSucks.org... or ShaveThisSkinner. edu.</p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]</p>
<p>He didn't say anything about SkinnerlnAShredder.com.</p>
<p><em>Let's make this the best year ever.</em></p>
<p>[GRUNTS]</p>
<p>Today we have a special guest: A documentary filmmaker whose works include <em>Lost Luggage, Shattered Lives...</em> and <em>Upskirt Dreams.</em></p>
<p>Please welcome Declan Desmond.</p>
<p>[STUDENTS APPLAUDING]</p>
<p>Thank you. Now, when you think of documentaries... you probably think of the Maysles brothers and Barbara Kopple.</p>
<p>Well, they're not good enough to wipe my lens.</p>
<p>Here's a look at my work.</p>
<p>A film I made about Krusty Burger: <em>Do You Want Lies With That?</em></p>
<p>[CAR HORN HONKS]</p>
<p>Does it bother you that Krusty uses mad cow beef to save money?</p>
<p>No. Because they pass the savings on to me, the consumer.</p>
<p>[GRUNTING]</p>
<p>Aren't you ashamed to lend your likeness to substandard food?</p>
<p>Look, I give people a meat-like burger and some kind of cola... and they still get change back from their 50.</p>
<p>Your customers may be shocked by my footage of you... stapling together abandoned, half-eaten burgers.</p>
<p>[CACKLES]</p>
<p>[CACKLES]</p>
<p><em>Good as new.</em></p>
<p>(All) Ew!</p>
<p>Powerful. Now he's gonna make a documentary... about Springfield Elementary... which I assume will be glowing and positive... unlike all of his other work.</p>
<p>Right. Now, everyone, while I'm filming, please be yourselves.</p>
<p>I want to see troubled children brooding, bullies doling out what for...</p>
<p>What about us cool kids? Should we just chill out?</p>
<p>You're doing great.</p>
<p>Stay with the dink.</p>
<p>America is supposed to be a democracy.</p>
<p>But in the schoolyard, cool rules.</p>
<p>And Springfield's Machiavelli of the monkey bars... is one Bartholomew Simpson.</p>
<p>On today's royal agenda: Digging up dirt clods to throw at his school chums.</p>
<p>I chuck them at nerds, girls I like. Whatever.</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>Munch mud, Simpson.</p>
<p>[ALL LAUGHING]</p>
<p>I'm telling.</p>
<p>[WHIMPERING] Oh, man.</p>
<p>And in a flash... Bart's glory has gone the way of England's masculinity.</p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]</p>
<p>It's a dangerous life being a hall monitor.</p>
<p>When you leave home in the morning... you may be kissing your dolls goodbye for the last time.</p>
<p>My sash says &quot;Ultraman.&quot;</p>
<p>[GRUNTS]</p>
<p>I think we've seen enough.</p>
<p>You should realize that our school is not all nitwits and Nelsons.</p>
<p>Why don't I open a door at random?</p>
<p>Why, look. It's typical student Lisa Simpson.</p>
<p>Oh, hello.</p>
<p>I've just been listening to Bach while reading at a sixth-grade level.</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>[LAUGHS]</p>
<p>Hitting it off already.</p>
<p>I haven't seen such a natural pair since half sandwich and soup of the day.</p>
<p>I'll leave you two alone.</p>
<p>Remember, as far as he knows, we still teach Math.</p>
<p>Hmm, Lisa, I can't help but wonder if this is a bit of a put-on.</p>
<p>Why, whatever do you mean?</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>[SNORING]</p>
<p>Huh? What? Go, Aberdeen!</p>
<p>[SNORING]</p>
<p>Ha, ha, you can't blame Principal Skinner for wanting to feature his best student.</p>
<p>And that's you.</p>
<p>Well, I am young, gifted and yellow.</p>
<p>My interests include music, science, justice, animals, shapes, feelings.</p>
<p>So you see yourself more as a buffet-style intellectual.</p>
<p>Picking and nibbling... until one day you're 38 and managing a Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>
<p>Hey, that's not gonna happen.</p>
<p>Lisa, I'm afraid you're a dilettante. Pick a path and follow it.</p>
<p>Or you'll grow up, slog your way through Mount Holyoke... and squeeze out babies.</p>
<p>Stop it!</p>
<p>Since Nelson nailed you with that dirt, no one thinks you're cool anymore.</p>
<p>Even that kid that wears diapers is more popular.</p>
<p>And he ain't popular.</p>
<p>So? I'll bounce back. I always bounce back.</p>
<p>Like after the time I accidentally called the teacher mom.</p>
<p>Even I b*at you up that day.</p>
<p>After you passed out.</p>
<p>[ALL GASPING]</p>
<p>What's that hood ornament doing around your neck?</p>
<p>I snapped it off some jerk's car.</p>
<p>I could go to prison for life, but whatever.</p>
<p><strong>Crowd</strong>: Ah! Wow!</p>
<p>The only way to be cooler than him is to do what he does.</p>
<p>I've gotta steal me a hood ornament.</p>
<p>But how?</p>
<p>[GROANS]</p>
<p>Is something wrong, kids? You haven't touched your Dinnerables.</p>
<p>Nelson steals a hood ornament and now he's king of the school.</p>
<p>All that's left for me is to become the biggest drunk this town's ever seen.</p>
<p>Pfft! Talking won't get you there.</p>
<p>Lisa, what's bumming you out?</p>
<p>They cancel a test or something?</p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]</p>
<p>Dad, my life lacks direction.</p>
<p>It's a concern. A serious concern.</p>
<p>Hey, I never chose a path.</p>
<p>And because I kept my options open, I can finally do what I want.</p>
<p>And what's that?</p>
<p>I'm gonna die alone.</p>
<p>Gotta pick a career. Gotta pick a career.</p>
<p>I can find a good career at this museum.</p>
<p>Or at least see if they fixed that mislabeled raccoon I complained about.</p>
<p>Hmm, maybe I could be an expert on dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Don't do it, little girl.</p>
<p>I spent 30 years brushing the teeth of dead monsters.</p>
<p>Maybe geology.</p>
<p>&quot;Formed by unimaginable heat and pressure deep inside the earth... minerals explode in a vast panoply of... &quot; Ew.</p>
<p>(Man (on recording)) <em>Since the dawn of time... travelers looking for guidance have turned to the heavens.</em></p>
<p>[GASPS]</p>
<p><em>Polaris, the star of the north... mighty Orion's Belt... the majestic Milky Way... home of a familiar blue planet we call... Rigel VII. Not too far from Earth.</p>
<p>We have only scratched the surface of the universe.</p>
<p>Who will discover the wonders that lie beyond our galaxy?</p>
<p>Will it be you or you?</p>
<p>Or you?</em></p>
<p>That's it. Lisa Simpson, astronomer.</p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: <em>Now who will press my reset button?</p>
<p>Will it be you?</p>
<p>Or you?</p>
<p>Or you?</em></p>
<p>Oh, Dad, look at this one.</p>
<p>Sweetie, Daddy doesn't have enough money for that.</p>
<p>Unless they take a check.</p>
<p>We certainly do.</p>
<p>Boing!</p>
<p>Why did you say that? Your check gonna bounce?</p>
<p>No, ha, ha, of course not.</p>
<p>Duh!</p>
<p>Why did you say that? Are you implying I'm dumb?</p>
<p>Ah, I have to go.</p>
<p>Oh, my God! Space monsters are invading us!</p>
<p>Dad, that's a moth.</p>
<p>Oh. Well, where do I twist this thing to make funny patterns?</p>
<p>Dad, that's a kaleidoscope.</p>
<p>You may be a smart kid... but you don't know much about not hurting people's feelings.</p>
<p>Okay. &quot;At 6:22 p.m., Venus will be visible at 27 degrees.&quot;</p>
<p>Hiyo!</p>
<p>[LISA GASPS]</p>
<p>Oh, it's beautiful.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>[BEACH BOYS &quot;GOOD VIBRATIONS&quot; PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]</p>
<p>Thanks a lot, surviving Beach Boys.</p>
<p>Okay. Jupiter should be somewhere around here.</p>
<p>Hmm... Hey.</p>
<p>[BOTH GASPING]</p>
<p>For three seconds there, you were legally the mayor.</p>
<p>Yeah. And you was a girl, Joe.</p>
<p>[GRUNTING]</p>
<p>[SIGHS]</p>
<p>It should be dark enough to see the stars up here.</p>
<p>You stole my stars, Springfield!</p>
<p>No one ever wrote a poem about sickly orange barf glow.</p>
<p>I know exactly how you feel, young lady.</p>
<p>What you are seeing is light pollution.</p>
<p>Light pollution.</p>
<p>For astronomers like me... this is a bigger problem even than... I don't know... say, getting a date, which is difficult for the geeky people.</p>
<p>We've gotta do something.</p>
<p>I know. Maybe we can get people to sign a petition.</p>
<p>Well, I'd like to help, I would.</p>
<p>But if I leave this observatory, another astronomer will move right in.</p>
<p>They're like hermit crabs. They... There's one now.</p>
<p>I see you!</p>
<p>[GRUNTS]</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: You said he was out of microscopes!</p>
<p>Hey, check out this hood ornament I stole.</p>
<p>With this glinting gewgaw... the beta male attempts to reclaim leadership of his herd.</p>
<p>Oh, that's good narration.</p>
<p>That's not a hood ornament. It's a pacifier you spray-painted silver.</p>
<p>[GRUNTS]</p>
<p>[GASPS THEN GROANS]</p>
<p>[ALL LAUGHING]</p>
<p>Ha, ha!</p>
<p>Wait, that's not right.</p>

<p>[BLOWS PITCH PIPE]</p>
<p>Ha, ha!</p>
<p>Oh, look. It's jill-of-all-trades.</p>
<p>So, what's the ambition du jour?</p>
<p>I'm collecting signatures to bring back the night sky.</p>
<p>Wow, the night sky.</p>
<p>How did you come up with that, tilt your head up?</p>
<p>Does it make you feel superior to tear down people's dreams?</p>
<p>Yes. Does it make you feel smart to question people's motives?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, all right then.</p>
<p>Hi. I'm trying to reduce light pollution.</p>
<p>Argh! I'd be happy to scrimshaw your petition.</p>
<p>People of Springfield, I've heard your pleas.</p>
<p>Whether you're an idealistic stargazer like Lisa... or a faded southern belle who needs the forgiving cloak of night... to seduce naïve young delivery boys with more pizza than common sense... I say Springfield will be the dimmest city in America.</p>
<p>[CROWD CHATTERING]</p>
<p>Look up at the stars, Springfield.</p>
<p>For eons, people have gazed at the skies and seen into their souls.</p>
<p>[GASPS]</p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]</p>
<p>Oh, stop.</p>
<p><em>Look out, Matthew Modine and Charlene Tilton.</p>
<p>There are new stars in town: Sky stars.</p>
<p>Now visible thanks to Springfield's latest cave-in... to the astronomer lobby.</p>
<p>The best part is... next week we'll get to see the Deadly meteor shower.</p>
<p>Deadly meteor shower?</p>
<p>Named after its discoverer, Professor Artimus Deadly... who was, ironically, k*ll in the shower of 1853.</em></p>
<p>The last time those meteors came, we thought the sky was on fire.</p>
<p>Naturally, we blamed it on the lrish.</p>
<p>We hanged more than a few.</p>
<p>[CROWD LAUGHING AND SHOUTING NEARBY]</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Sounds like some bad eggs are cooking up trouble.</p>
<p>Mm... Bad eggs.</p>
<p>[GURGLING]</p>
<p>[ALL WHOOPING]</p>
<p>Check it out.</p>
<p>This is great. It's darker than a French chick's armpit.</p>
<p>Oh, every car has been harvested.</p>
<p>I've got to get that hood ornament. No matter who owns it.</p>
<p>[BIRD CHIRPING]</p>
<p>[TIRES SQUEAL]</p>
<p>That bird touched my car.</p>
<p>You know what to do.</p>
<p>You're gonna be drinking worms through a straw.</p>
<p>[BOTH GRUNTING AND BIRD SQUAWKING]</p>
<p>[GULPS]</p>
<p><em>Springfield's pro-darkness policy has resulted in vandalism... unmatched since the Detroit Tigers last made the playoffs... over two centuries ago.</p>
<p>The government has issued an Orange alert... which, once again, means nothing.</em></p>
<p>Time to get that hood's ornament.</p>
<p>[BART &amp; MILHOUSE GRUNTING]</p>
<p>[IN ITALIAN ACCENT] <em>Buonasera</em>, Fat Tony.</p>
<p>I park your car the way Mama used to do.</p>
<p>Why, thank you. And may I say... your mustache looks thick and hearty.</p>
<p>Fully ltalian.</p>
<p>[IN ITALIAN ACCENT] Try the cheese pizza.</p>
<p>It's greasy like, uh, you.</p>
<p>[IN NORMAL VOICE] You're gonna depreciate a Mafia don's car?</p>
<p>[IN NORMAL VOICE] Hey, heh, we're all gonna be m*rder someday.</p>
<p>(All (chanting)) <em>Two, four, six, eight! It's time to reilluminate!</em></p>
<p>Mr. Mayor, you can't flip-flop on this.</p>
<p>We'll miss the meteor shower.</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know how you keep getting past Security.</p>
<p>[GROANS]</p>
<p>Luigi, I appreciate your courtesy valet service.</p>
<p>I made a note on your card in my Rolodex: &quot;Don't whack.&quot;</p>
<p>Thank you, Fat Tony. Thank you.</p>
<p>But at the risk of enraging you by making you look stupid... we have no valet parking.</p>
<p>You mean that 10-year-old with a mustache was a phony?</p>
<p>You know, Bart, I really like spending time with you.</p>
<p>Just hold the light.</p>
<p>I can't see nothing.</p>
<p>Let's fire blindly into the dark.</p>
<p>No. You might hit a made man.</p>
<p>They want light...</p>
<p>Unh.</p>
<p>...by God, they'll get light.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>[BOTH SCREAM]</p>
<p>[BOTH SIGH]</p>
<p>End of the line.</p>
<p>[BOTH SCREAM]</p>
<p>[BOTH GROANING]</p>
<p>Hey, you're not John Ritter.</p>
<p>And you ain't that gorilla from the zoo.</p>
<p>Eh.</p>
<p>Eh.</p>
<p>Okay, you filthy booze-bags, it's 2 a.m. So, uh, who's the designated driver?</p>
<p>It was Andy.</p>
<p>[LAUGHS]</p>
<p>No one's ever won Moe's drink-a-gallon-of-gin challenge.</p>
<p>And no one ever will.</p>
<p>Ah, life is good.</p>
<p>Hey, what happened? It's bright in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>You know what this reminds me of? My lcelandic boyhood.</p>
<p>It's this new anti-crime dealie.</p>
<p>The mayor turned the street lights way up.</p>
<p>My daughter Lisa feels really strongly about it.</p>
<p>Pro or con?</p>
<p>I don't know. What am I, Super Dad?</p>
<p>Boy, this light has really screwed up the animals.</p>
<p>[CHIRPS]</p>
<p>I'll bet somewhere there's a horse drinking coffee.</p>
<p>I haven't slept in seven days.</p>
<p>And I've gotten so much ironing done.</p>
<p>&quot;Live from New York, it's Saturday Night.&quot;</p>
<p>[MARGE HUMMING]</p>
<p>Dad, this lack of sleep is making Mom and Maggie crazy.</p>
<p>Don't you think you're overreacting, talking gumball machine?</p>
<p>Or an assemblyman on the take.</p>
<p>Forget it. It's so bright out, you can't see anything in the sky... except the Fox satellite.</p>
<p>No, I got my eyes on the prize.</p>
<p>The hood ornament I desperately want for reasons I can no longer remember.</p>
<p>The only thing stopping me is those lights.</p>
<p>Huh! Bart, I just realized... we both want the same thing: Darkness. And we can get it if we work together.</p>
<p>With my brain and your, uh...</p>
<p>Your assistance...</p>
<p>You can say it. I add nothing.</p>
<p>You can't have light without power.</p>
<p>And all the power comes from here.</p>
<p>How'd you get Dad to go along with this?</p>
<p>In his sleep-deprived state, he's very suggestible.</p>
