							<p>Springfield Connection.</p>
<p>Aren't you glad we got out of the house and came downtown for a little culture?</p>
<p>They're butchering the classics.</p>
<p>Could that bassoon have come in any more late?</p>
<p>Oh, come on, Homer. There's lasers. You like lasers.</p>
<p>Laser effects, mirrored balls... John Williams must be rolling around in his grave.</p>
<p>Devil-iciously satirical. I wonder if anyone else got that.</p>
<p>We're out of here!</p>
<p>Be careful. These are dangerous streets for us upper-lower-middle-class types.</p>
<p>So avoid eye contact, watch your pocketbook, and suspect everyone.</p>
<p>Three-card monte.</p>
<p>Easy money!</p>
<p>Homer, these games are fixed.</p>
<p>Then how come that guy's winning?</p>
<p>I, like, totally won again.</p>
<p>Way to go, bro!</p>
<p>He looks and acts just like the dealer.</p>
<p>I think they're related, or at least in cahoots.</p>
<p>Just pick the red card. It's totally not hard.</p>
<p>Twenty on this one, my good man.</p>
<p>Sorry, dude. Black.</p>
<p>Homer, he cheated you!</p>
<p>You're giving three-car monte a bad name!</p>
<p>Surely you don't blame me?</p>
<p>It's people like you who are ruining our downtown promenades and piazzas.</p>
<p>How dare you prey on the greedy and stupid like this!</p>
<p>Bye-bye!</p>
<p>Somebody stop him!</p>
<p>He's getting away! Come on! Come on!</p>
<p>No, Marge!</p>
<p>I must warn you... sometimes ordinary people get a surge of adrenaline.</p>
<p>See?</p>
<p>Cuff him, boys.</p>
<p>We're putting this dirtbag away.</p>
<p>I'll be back on the street in 24 hours.</p>
<p>We'll try to make it 12.</p>
<p>Marge, are you okay?</p>
<p>I think I'm okay.</p>
<p>It was scary, but in a weird way it was also kind of exhilarating.</p>
<p>Yes. It is exhilarating to see police get their man and save a hysterical woman.</p>
<p>Oh, for crying out loud.</p>
<p>Easy, now, sweetheart. Homie's here.</p>
<p>Hey, Mom. Is this how you caught him?</p>
<p>Face it, Lis. You're too puny to...</p>
<p>Lisa, unhand your brother.</p>
<p>Yeah, like that really hurt.</p>
<p>Mom, was catching that guy the most exciting thing you've ever done?</p>
<p>Well, it was pretty exciting.</p>
<p>But celery soup's pretty exciting too.</p>
<p>Strange. Regular ham doesn't thrill me anymore.</p>
<p>I'm crossing over to deviled ham.</p>
<p>Marge!</p>
<p>Hey, Mrs. Simpson, I just got the new issue of Sponge and Vacuum.</p>
<p>Thanks, Benevenstanciano.</p>
<p>Death sports.</p>
<p>All right, get in there.</p>
<p>You're going down.</p>
<p>I want a piece of him.</p>
<p>You think you're pretty hot, huh? Well, we got everything we need on you.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>What? What? What?</p>
<p>What? What? What? This better be about pizza.</p>
<p>Actually, I'm interested in becoming a police officer.</p>
<p>Welcome aboard.</p>
<p>You did what?!</p>
<p>I borrowed your nail clipper. What's the big deal?</p>
<p>Nothing. I'm just edgy since your mother told me she wants to be a cop.</p>
<p>Cool! Will you bring me along when you do evictions?</p>
<p>You got it, little buddy.</p>
<p>You being a cop makes you the man.</p>
<p>Which makes me the woman. And I have no interest in that.</p>
<p>Besides occasionally wearing the underwear... which, as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.</p>
<p>Homer, there's no reason for you to feel threatened.</p>
<p>You'll always be the man of this house.</p>
<p>Thanks, honey.</p>
<p>All right, you scrawny beanpoles.</p>
<p>Becoming a cop is not something that happens overnight.</p>
<p>It takes one solid weekend of training to get that badge.</p>
<p>Forget about the badge! When do we get the freaking g*n?!</p>
<p>Hey, I told you, you don't get your g*n until you tell me your name.</p>
<p>I've had it up to here with your &quot;rules&quot;!</p>
<p>Women always have trouble with the wall.</p>
<p>They never seem to find the door.</p>
<p>You missed the baby. You missed the blind man.</p>
<p>Oh. Sorry, Simpson. You'll have to do the course again.</p>
<p>I was trying to get this Magic Eye thing to work.</p>
<p>Look at that. A pony.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody! Mom's home.</p>
<p>They didn't have my size shirt, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>Wow, Mom. I never pictured you as any kind of authority figure before.</p>
<p>Marge, I want you to take care of yourself out there.</p>
<p>You've become very dear to me.</p>
<p>Homie, of course I will.</p>
<p>Mom, if someone sh*t at the mayor, would you have to take the b*llet?</p>
<p>I suppose I would.</p>
<p>What about a Coke machine?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>TV?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>TV with a picture of the mayor on it?</p>
<p>Whatever you do, we'll be proud of you.</p>
<p>Well, thank you, honey.</p>
<p>As long as it's constitutional.</p>
<p>Homer, give me my pepper spray!</p>
<p>Oh, Marge. One squirt and you're south of the border.</p>
<p>Incapacitating.</p>
<p>All right, settle, people. People, settle.</p>
<p>People. Ward and Van Zuylen, stake out Doughnut Land.</p>
<p>When they fry up a fresh batch, call it in.</p>
<p>Keneally and Earhart, back them up.</p>
<p>Fitz and Garcia, it's your turn to sleep in.</p>
<p>And, Simpson... seeing how this is your first day... you're inexperienced and vulnerable... your b*at is Junkyville and Bumtown.</p>
<p>Hello, Mr. Hutz.</p>
<p>I'll have you know the contents of that dumpster are private.</p>
<p>You stick your nose in, you'll be violating attorney-dumpster confidentiality.</p>
<p>I just wanted to say hello.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>You are the new cop on the b*at?</p>
<p>Okay. I know the drill.</p>
<p>What will it be? One hundred? Two hundred?</p>
<p>Two hundred. No, no. I mean, nothing. I don't take bribes!</p>
<p>Yes, of course you don't.</p>
<p>I will just leave this money on the table... with my unseeing back to the money on the table.</p>
<p>Apu, no.</p>
<p>That's better.</p>
<p>That's better.</p>
<p>Don 't you think for one minute you can go on...</p>
<p>I got a report on a domestic disturbance at this address.</p>
<p>Yes, indeed there is.</p>
<p>There's an inflatable bath pillow that Mother and I both enjoy.</p>
<p>She claimed it was her day to use it. I said she was mistaken. We quarreled.</p>
<p>Later, as I prepared to bathe... I noticed, to my horror, that someone... had slashed the pillow.</p>
<p>Who called the police?</p>
<p>We both did.</p>
<p>We both did.</p>
<p>Why don 't you two settle down. I'm sure you can get another pillow.</p>
<p>Well, I could send it back to Taiwan for repair. But why should I have to?</p>
<p>I've done nothing wrong!</p>
<p>And I don 't give permission for my face to be on TV. I want it blurred.</p>
<p>What are you gonna do with your day off?</p>
<p>I just want to relax and forget that I'm part... of that thin blue line which stands between civilization and chaos.</p>
<p>It's illegal for you to operate that class-9 vehicle without pads and a helmet.</p>
<p>But, Mom...</p>
<p>It's for your own safety.</p>
<p>Take that, safety boy!</p>
<p>This padding's so easy on the knuckles, I could punch all day!</p>
<p>I just hope they have Us magazine in heaven.</p>
<p>He said it was his day to use the tub pillow!</p>
<p>I can't go to the library anymore. Everybody stinks.</p>
<p>Don't stop talking on account of me. I may be a cop, but I'm still your friend.</p>
<p>So how are you, Mrs. Krabappel?</p>
<p>Law-abiding. I'm done.</p>
<p>Moe, I've never seen you here before.</p>
<p>Well, these days, my roots don't stay so chestnut on their own, Officer Simpson.</p>
<p>You don't have to call me &quot;officer.&quot; I'm not on duty here.</p>
<p>Finished.</p>
<p>Looks nice. It's a good length for you.</p>
<p>Mom's police tape isn't a toy, Dad.</p>
<p>Shush, dear. You'll wreck Daddy's fun.</p>
<p>Oh, my Lord! Something horrible has happened!</p>
<p>Fooled you, Flanders.</p>
<p>Made you think your family was dead!</p>
<p>Did you get it?</p>
<p>They're not, though.</p>
<p>But you thought they were.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That's why it was so funny.</p>
<p>But they're not.</p>
<p>That's a good one.</p>
<p>And that's the drunk t*nk, and this is Mommy's desk.</p>
<p>Mom, I know your intentions are good.</p>
<p>But aren't police a force that maintains the status quo for the wealthy elite?</p>
<p>Don't you think we should attack social problems... instead of jamming people into overcrowded prisons?</p>
<p>Look, Lisa! It's McGriff the Crime Dog.</p>
<p>Hello, Lisa. Help me bite crime.</p>
<p>Hey, great news, guys! I picked up a nudie deck for our game.</p>
<p>&quot;The girls of the lnternet.&quot;</p>
<p>I'd go online with them any day.</p>
<p>Hey, hey! We've offended Herman.</p>
<p>No, I'm just going out for some fresh air.</p>
<p>That guy sure likes his fresh air.</p>
<p>None of that for me.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah... Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Homer, you sure it's okay to smoke Cuban cigars and gamble... now that your wife's a cop?</p>
<p>Are you kidding?</p>
<p>Being a cop husband is one mighty sweet deal.</p>
<p>This police radio entertains me with other people's miseries... we get a free funeral for Marge, God forbid... and I can run background checks on whomever I want, Momar.</p>
<p>Please, please. Lx-nay on the Omar-may.</p>
<p>Hurry it up with the cards, Lenny. I've got you clocked at two miles per hour.</p>
<p>Put that away. Radar g*n give you cancer.</p>
<p>All the more reason to hurry up.</p>
<p>Hey, what could be going 100 miles per...?</p>
<p>Illegal gambling in my house?</p>
<p>Your house? Your house?</p>
<p>Gee, it's so glamorously decorated, I thought I was in Vegas.</p>
<p>Hey, you guys lied to me! You said it was Vegas!</p>
<p>We'll be going.</p>
<p>We'll just be going. See you around.</p>

<p>Marge, you chased away all my poker buddies.</p>
<p>I didn't mean to.</p>
<p>You've become such a cop.</p>
<p>Not that long ago, you were so much more to me.</p>
<p>You were a cleaner of pots, a sewer of buttons, an unplugger of hairy clogs.</p>
<p>I'm still all those things.</p>
<p>Only now I'm cleaning up the city, sewing together the social fabric... and unplugging the clogs of our legal system.</p>
<p>You're cooking what for dinner?</p>
<p>Everywhere I look, someone is breaking the law.</p>
<p>Dog, no leash. Man littering.</p>
<p>Horse not wearing diaper.</p>
<p>Car parked across three handicapped spaces.</p>
<p>Homer!</p>
<p>Hey, Marge. How's my little piglet?</p>
<p>Homer, I'm on duty.</p>
<p>That's okay. I'm supposed to be working too.</p>
<p>You have to move your car.</p>
<p>I'll just be a second, Marge. I'm going to get some beer for those kids over there.</p>
<p>I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that. But you have to move your car now.</p>
<p>I'll be right back. Now keep your eyes peeled for a real cop.</p>
<p>That's it! I'm gonna write you a ticket!</p>
<p>Come on! We're family!</p>
<p>You're breaking the law!</p>
<p>I'll make you a deal.</p>
<p>You rip up that ticket and I'll give you back your hat!</p>
<p>Homer, taking an officer's cap is an arrestable offense.</p>
<p>What are you gonna do about it? What are you gonna do, huh?</p>
<p>&quot;I'm Officer Marge. I'm gonna arrest you. &quot; Whoa! What?</p>
<p>Marge, not here. Hey.</p>
<p>You're not really arresting me?</p>
<p>You have the right to remain silent.</p>
<p>I choose to waive that right.</p>
<p>All right, Simpson. You're free to go.</p>
<p>Let me just finish this last lobster tail and raspberry torte.</p>
<p>All right, Hans. Time to go.</p>
<p>But he ate my last meal.</p>
<p>If that's the worst thing that happens to you today, consider yourself lucky.</p>
<p>Are you really allowed to execute people in a local jail?</p>
<p>From this point on, no talking.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I had to arrest you, Homer, but what I did was right.</p>
<p>When you need it, you'll be happy there are dedicated cops like me out there.</p>
<p>I have nothing more to say to you.</p>
<p>I'm drawing a line down the center of the house, à la I Love Lucy.</p>
<p>You stay on your side and I'll stay on my side.</p>
<p>Boy, when Marge first told me she was going to the police academy... I thought it'd be fun and exciting. You know, like that movie Spaceballs.</p>
<p>Instead it's been painful and disturbing, like that movie Police Academy.</p>
<p>Hey, Homer. I'm worried about the beer supply.</p>
<p>After this case, and the other case, there's only one case left!</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah! Barney's right!</p>
<p>Yeah, let's drink some beer.</p>
<p>What about some beer? Yeah, Barney's right.</p>
<p>All right, guys. Pipe down. I got some more in the garage.</p>
<p>No. I'll get it for you, Homer.</p>
<p>I wonder why he's so eager to go to the garage.</p>
<p>The garage. Hey, fellas! The garage.</p>
<p>Well, la-di-da, Mr. Frenchman.</p>
<p>Well, what do you call it?</p>
<p>A car hole.</p>
<p>You're late, Herman.</p>
<p>Surely you don't mind waiting... for merchandise of this quality, Mr. Jericho?</p>
<p>Looks like good stuff. But, of course, I'll have to sample it first.</p>
<p>These are fabulous!</p>
<p>Yeah. Who would suspect that they're counterfeit jeans?</p>
<p>What better place to make the buy... than in a cop's garage, where no one would suspect a thing?</p>
<p>Herman, I had to come out here to see what's so funny.</p>
<p>A counterfeit-jeans ring operating out of my car hole!</p>
<p>I'm gonna tell everyone! Wait here.</p>
<p>Not so fast.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Maybe you should just stop entirely.</p>
<p>Herman, how could you?</p>
<p>We've all thought about counterfeiting jeans.</p>
<p>But what about the v*ctim?</p>
<p>Hardworking designers like Calvin Klein, Gloria Vanderbilt or Antoine Bugle Boy?</p>
<p>These are the people who saw an overcrowded marketplace... and said, &quot;Me too!&quot;</p>
<p>Advance on him, men.</p>
<p>I don't think that's a very good idea.</p>
<p>Oh, no! It's Gloria Vanderbilt out for revenge.</p>
<p>No, it's Officer Simpson of the police.</p>
<p>Herman, your beef is with me! Leave the girl out of this!</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Homer!</p>
<p>It's too late for me, Marge! Sell the jeans and live like a queen!</p>
<p>Is Bart home?</p>
<p>Just taking Maggie for a stroll.</p>
<p>I guess I am putting up the Halloween decorations a little early.</p>
<p>Criticism accepted.</p>
<p>Marge!</p>
<p>Go, Mom!</p>
<p>Bust him! All right, Mom!</p>
<p>Go back to bed! Don't make me come up there!</p>
<p>Looks like your wife is embarking up the wrong tree.</p>
<p>Freeze! Every mother knows the secret entrance to her son's tree house.</p>
<p>Oh, Marge, you saved my life.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I teased you.</p>
<p>You're a really good cop. I'm proud of you.</p>
<p>So long. Gotta catch the 501.</p>
<p>He's getting away! You blew it, Marge.</p>
<p>I don't think so.</p>
<p>Foiled by my own shoddy merchandise!</p>
<p>That's my ambulance! I called for it four hours ago!</p>
<p>Marge, how did you know?</p>
<p>That the pants would rip?</p>
<p>No. What...</p>
<p>Years of buying pants for children and a full-seated husband... has given me a sixth sense for shoddy stitching... which these jeans have in spades.</p>
<p>That's nice work, Simpson, but we can't hold him. There's no evidence.</p>
<p>There's a garage full of counterfeit jeans.</p>
<p>They've mysteriously disappeared.</p>
<p>Looking good, boys.</p>
<p>That's it. There's too much corruption on this force. I quit.</p>
<p>Sorry to lose you, Simpson.</p>
<p>I don't think they're coming back.</p>
<p>Well, that does it. That does it. I'm looking at his cards.</p>
<p>Crap. I fold.</p>
