<p>(SCREAMS)</p>
<p>(Quimby) Welcome to the Mayor's Easter Egg Hunt.</p>
<p>And now my rarely-seen wife would like to say a few words.</p>
<p>Thank you, Joe.</p>
<p>In just a few moments, the hunt will be opened by our own rascally referee, Hugs Bunny.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sorry, kid.</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>Legally, I'm not allowed to hug you.</p>
<p>Now begin the hunt!</p>
<p>Joe! You said your wife was dead!</p>
<p>And you said you graduated from typing school.</p>
<p>I have trouble with the <em>space</em> bar.</p>
<p>(CHILDREN CHEERING)</p>
<p>Nelson, those don't count as Easter eggs.</p>
<p>Yeah. But they count as breakfast.</p>
<p>(BIRDS SQUAWKING) Ahhh!</p>
<p>It was worth it!</p>
<p>Yay!</p>
<p>Yay!</p>
<p>Yay!</p>
<p>Yay!</p>
<p>Ralph, there's a hole in your basket.</p>
<p>You're Lisa's brother.</p>
<p>(YELPS)</p>
<p>Hey! Nobody pushes around my precious bundle of joy!</p>
<p>Oops. Wrong one.</p>
<p>I'll take that!</p>
<p>Too slow, Droolie Joe!</p>
<p>Peek-a-boo, I steal from you!</p>
<p>(Comma)</p>
<p>(BLOWS WHISTLE) Sir, you want to set the baby down?</p>
<p>Don't worry. I just wanna talk.</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>Silly rabbit, kicks are for ribs!</p>
<p>(BOTH GRUNTING)</p>
<p>(growls)</p>
<p>This house has such beautiful wainscoting.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES) Well, Marge, I didn't know you were into wainscoting.</p>
<p>I read an article about it at the tire store.</p>
<p>Did you know it's not named after someone named Wayne Scott?</p>
<p>WOMEN; Oh!</p>
<p>(INDISTINCT CHATTER)</p>
<p>(SCREAMING)</p>
<p>You are now in the mayor's office.</p>
<p>This is the switch the mayor uses to call his chief of staff.</p>
<p>(SEDUCTIVE MUSIC PLAYING)</p>
<p>(SIGHS)</p>
<p>That concludes our tour.</p>
<p>(ALL GROANING)</p>
<p>But I'd love it if you'd all join me for tea in the parlor.</p>
<p>Tea? In the parlor?</p>
<p>You're like all Easter Bunnies!</p>
<p>Can't take a punch to the crotch!</p>
<p>Maybe next time you'll think twice before you &quot;volunteer to help children!&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, hey, Marge.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES) This is my husband, Homer.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)</p>
<p>Ladies. Marge, is there a small rip in my pants?</p>
<p>(ALL GASPING)</p>
<p>Homer, please.</p>
<p>We're about to have tea.</p>
<p>No tea. Security!</p>
<p>(SEDUCTIVE MUSIC PLAYING)</p>
<p>Oh! Everyone, just go!</p>
<p>Way to blow our tea, Marge.</p>
<p>That's the last refrigerator magnet calendar you get from me!</p>
<p>We throw those out anyway.</p>
<p>You lie! Stop lying!</p>
<p>Hey, goad-lookin'.</p>
<p>Want to snuggle with Tyrannosaurus Sex?</p>
<p>(GROWLS)</p>
<p>No, I don't!</p>
<p>I'm still upset about what happened today.</p>
<p>I don't have many friends.</p>
<p>And when I finally start to make some, you ruin it.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, honey. You have lots of friends.</p>
<p>There's, uh, Lisa, and the stove.</p>
<p>Hmph!</p>
<p>Oh, that poor woman. I'm gonna find her a friend.</p>
<p>Someone cute, athletic, with a nice laugh.</p>
<p>(CLICKING)</p>
<p>(GASPS) My husband and my best friend?</p>
<p>(SQUEALS)</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>It's a risk I'll have to take.</p>
<p>What'cha looking for, Lisa?</p>
<p>Summer opportunities.</p>
<p>We're going to twin camp.</p>
<p>(GASPS) Oh, my God! &quot;Spend a summer in Rome!&quot;</p>
<p>Rome? Founded by twins by the way.</p>
<p>Hey! Where'd she go?</p>
<p>Oh, well. Let's talk in our secret twin language.</p>
<p>(BOTH SPEAKING GIBBERISH)</p>
<p>Okay, Lisa. To study in Rome, an applicant needs outstanding grades... Check.</p>
<p>Uh-oh. Lisa, it says you have to speak fluent ltalian.</p>
<p>Uh, check.</p>
<p>You speak ltalian?</p>
<p>Of course I do.</p>
<p>Why would I say it if I didn't?</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>Flawless logic.</p>
<p>But I am gonna have to ask you to speak a few phrases to verify your fluency.</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>Though not now because I have a series of important meetings.</p>
<p>(SIGHS WITH RELIEF) How's tomorrow for you?</p>
<p>(WHIMPERS) Because it's terrible for me.</p>
<p>But I'll get back to you, soon.</p>
<p>(WHIMPERS)</p>
<p>Son, I need to find a new friend for your mother.</p>
<p>So you're gonna have to finish the shopping yourself.</p>
<p>We're on Food Stamps?</p>
<p>I wish. I made these at work.</p>
<p>(HOMER CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>Hmm. I bet she'd be a good friend for Marge. She looks defeated, too.</p>
<p>Psst! Psst!</p>

<p>(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)</p>
<p>(CAT YOWLS)</p>
<p>Hmph. I'm going out for some air!</p>
<p>I bet you can't throw a cat over the house.</p>

<p>(CAT YOWLS)</p>
<p>Huh, I was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: (SINGING) <em>Everybody hurts.</p>

<p>(GASPS) The nationwide social organization for women of a certain age?</p>
<p>Yeah. But we don't sit around watching television and eating bonbons.</p>
<p>Well, except on W-bonbon night, which is every Tuesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>What are you doing today?</p>
<p>We're gonna have margaritas and poke gentle fun at our husbands.</p>
<p>Would you like to join us?</p>
<p>Would I? Now let's see.</p>

<p>He spent my last three birthdays in jail.</p>
<p>Called out his bowling hall's name during sex!</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, honey! Save it for Johnny Fiestas!</p>
<p>(Announcer on tv) <em>And now, we return to the Vic Tayback Motel and Casino in downtown Las Vegas for Has-Been Celebrity Poker.</p>

<p>(GASPS) That's my Italian tutor.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, Milhouse, I think Bart's upstairs.</p>
<p>I'm not here for Bart. I'm here to teach you ltalian.</p>
<p>Oh, sure. I get it.</p>
<p>Bart told you I was taking lessons so you thought you'd come over and...</p>

<p>I'm the tutor the company sent over.</p>
<p>I'm here to teach you <em>la lingua di arte e la musica.</em></p>
<p>You really speak ltalian? <em>Si.</em></p>
<p>My grandmother, Nana Sofie, lives in Tuscany.</p>
<p>Since I was a baby, I've spent two weeks there every summer.</p>
<p><em>Nana hated English because in World w*r II a G.I. left her with Child.</p>

<p>Nana only spoke Italian to me.</em></p>
<p>(SPEAKING ITALIAN)</p>

<p>That's howl learned ltalian and started wetting my bed.</p>
<p>Anyway, what do you say? Can I be your <em>insegnante?</em></p>
<p>Okay. If that means &quot;teacher.&quot;</p>
<p>It means &quot;masculine teacher.&quot;</p>
<p>Bye, ladies. You can text message me anytime.</p>
<p>We already did!</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: Ooh!</p>

<p>(GIGGLES) Thank you. I've been studying. I even made flash cards.</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>My efforts!</p>
<p>Oh, Lisa. You don't learn ltalian, you live ltalian!</p>
<p>Come, we ride to Little ltaly.</p>
<p>But first, Hake care of some classroom business.</p>
<p>Lisa Simpson? Present.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>(ALL SPEAKING ITALIAN)</p>
<p>(SPEAKING ITALIAN)</p>
<p>One gelato for, oh, the pretty girl.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>Ah, Mr. Milhouse, thank goodness!</p>
<p>Could you translate and help me buy cheese for my lasagna?</p>
<p>But Luigi, surely you speak ltalian?</p>
<p>(SIGHS) No, I don’t. I only speak, how you say, fractured English.</p>
<p>That's what my parents spoke at home.</p>
<p>I had a wonderful time today.</p>
<p>(SPEAKING ITALIAN)</p>
<p>(GIGGLES)</p>
<p>I'm the luckiest boy in the world!</p>
<p>Don't be in love, stupid!</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>Tammy, I'd never have the courage to skydive if it weren't for you girls.</p>
<p>Thanks, Marge.</p>
<p>And you know, when we land, we've got a little surprise for ya.</p>
<p>Ooh. Well, now I really hope my chute opens.</p>
<p>(WIND HOWLING)</p>
<p>Goodbye, cruel world!</p>
<p>Ladies.</p>
<p>Marge Simpson, we hereby induct you as a full member of the Cheery Red Tomatoes.</p>
<p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p>I feel a happiness I've never felt.</p>
<p>I not only have friends, I have a hat to prove it.</p>
<p>Now Marge, as a full member, you get to share in all our secrets.</p>
<p>Like our recipe for mock apple pie.</p>
<p>The secret is it's got apples in it.</p>
<p>And now we can tell you the secret plans for our fundraiser.</p>
<p>This year, we're gonna steal one million dollars from Mr. Burns.</p>
<p>(GASPS) You're joking! You've gotta be joking!</p>
<p>You're not joking.</p>
<p>Oh, any other surprises?</p>
<p>I'm not a natural redhead.</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I can't steal. Not even from Mr. Burns.</p>
<p>Mr. Burns promised a million dollars to the Springfield Children's Hospital.</p>
<p>And then...</p>
<p>Instead of donating this money, I'm going to use it to extend my own life another 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Smithers?</p>

<p>Who's a stinky dog? You are.</p>
<p>Michelle's going to work on you today. Yes, she is.</p>
<p>There are 12 Faberge eggs in his vault, each worth a small fortune.</p>
<p>We can get them, but we need your special k*ll.</p>
<p>When I joined, I never thought we'd be robbing people.</p>
<p>You said you wanted friends!</p>
<p>And the one thing about friends is that they stick together!</p>
<p>Especially when they're trying to pull off a million-dollar heist.</p>
<p>Maybe we were a little too quick to give you that hat.</p>
<p>Take back the hail She deserves bare hair!</p>
<p>(All) Bare hair! Bare hair!</p>
<p>Okay, okay, okay, I'm in!</p>
<p>You ladies doing okay down there?</p>
<p>Sorry to wake you, Stanley.</p>
<p>Don't let us down, newbie.</p>
<p>(Announcer on tv) <em>Welcome back to Fox Sports West II Classic Fox Sports Fox.</em></p>

<p>Oh, heh...</p>

<p>Wait a minute. If she's going bird watching, <em>why did she leave our Peterson's Field Guide to Birds</em> on the kitchen counter?</p>

<p>That's Mr. Burns' mansion!</p>
<p>Remind me, Smithers, while we're out, I need to get my eyes re-balled and my brain flushed outwith vinegar.</p>
<p>Yes, sir. Oh, and your knees will be back from the shop tomorrow.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Okay, Marge. You're the only one of us skinny enough to squeeze through this vent.</p>
<p>That's my special k*ll?</p>
<p>Well, what'd you think? You're a master of disguise?</p>
<p>Not with that 'do.</p>
<p>I thought you liked my hair.</p>
<p>It's all right.</p>
<p>I've gotta stop Marge from doing something reckless and irresponsible!</p>
<p>(PEOPLE SCREAMING)</p>
<p>Lou, we better go after him.</p>
<p>Eddie, you direct traffic. You're the graceful one.</p>
<p>You got it, Chief.</p>
<p>(Clancy) Look at him tease that Subaru.</p>
<p>And that guy can't find a girlfriend. I'll never figure it out.</p>
<p>I got the combination from Burns after I let him feel me up during the Depression.</p>
<p>Zero to the right, zero to the left, (DIAL CLICKING) back to zero.</p>
<p>(POLICE SIREN WAILING)</p>
<p>Marge, I wanted to save you from the cops. But the cops followed me!</p>
<p>Game over, man! Game over!</p>
<p>So are you gonna introduce me to your friends?</p>
<p>Don't worry, Mr. Burns. We'll get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p>Excuse me, Lou. I'm supposed to say that.</p>
<p>Acting like the chief doesn't make you the chief.</p>
<p>If I was acting like the chief, I'd need size 58 pants.</p>
<p>Oh, here we go with the fat jokes.</p>
<p>You know, I just wish you could hit the easy targets on the firing range so well.</p>
<p>Oh, Lou, why do we hurt each other so?</p>
<p>Because sometimes it's easier to be cruel than to say what you really feel.</p>
<p>Permission to hug, Chief?</p>
<p>Permission (SOBS) granted.</p>
<p>Granted, Lou! Thank you, Chief!</p>
<p>Oh, enough!</p>
<p>While you morons are canoodling, someone's burgling my miscellanea.</p>
<p>(g*n)</p>
<p>Try to take my eggs, will you?</p>
<p>Well, this rooster has a beak.</p>
<p>A beak which calls out death-a-doodle-doo.</p>
<p>Why, you're all women.</p>
<p>I'm not.</p>
<p>I suppose. But you're certainly buxom and flirty.</p>
<p>Oh, well, I try to have a good time.</p>
<p>All I wanted to do was join a group of women who wore the same outfits!</p>
<p>(CRYING)</p>
<p>(ALL CRYING)</p>
<p>(SIGHS)</p>
<p>Oh, no jury on earth would convict a bunch of moist-eyed mothers.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what, ladies.</p>
<p>Give me my eggs back and I'll let you go.</p>
<p>(SOBS)</p>
<p>And tell me I'm not fat!</p>
<p>(SCOFFS)</p>
<p>Well, I guess our fundraiser was a failure.</p>
<p>Don't be so sure.</p>
<p>Ah, Marge, I love you.</p>
<p>But to be safe, sweetie, I don't think we can ever see each other again.</p>
<p>I'll really miss you guys.</p>
<p>I'll never forget the three activities we did together.</p>
<p>(SNIFFLES)</p>
<p>Listen, Marge.</p>
<p>No matter where you go in this life, you'll always have one friend who loves you, body and soul.</p>
<p>And Marge, there are certain things.</p>
<p>I can do for you that no other friend can.</p>
<p>Special things.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>Wow, this is special.</p>
<p>(THUDS)</p>
<p>I can't believe this happened to me twice!</p>
