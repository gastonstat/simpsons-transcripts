							<p>Hey, kids, it's story time!</p>
<p>I'm gonna tell you the story of Krusty's expensive new suit: His sexual-harassment suit.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>Anyway, as part of Krusty's plea bargain... he has a new court-ordered sidekick... Ms. No-Means-No.</p>
<p>You're hot. Let's get some dinner after the show.</p>
<p>I have dinner with all my employees. Right, Sideshow Mel?</p>
<p>We've never spoken outside of work.</p>
<p>I'm surprised he didn't blame his problems on his Percodan addiction.</p>
<p>Wasn't my fault. It was the Percodan.</p>
<p>If you ask me, that stuff rots your brain.</p>
<p>And now a word from my new sponsor.</p>
<p>Percodan?! Oh, crap!</p>
<p>Bart, are you ready for your history test?</p>
<p>You bet, Mom. Ask me anything.</p>
<p>Okay. Who was George Washington Carver?</p>
<p>Um...</p>
<p>The guy who chopped up George Washington?</p>
<p>Really? Wow.</p>
<p>Bart, you said you were going to study.</p>
<p>Oh! My stomach.</p>
<p>You just don't wanna take that test.</p>
<p>No, I mean it. It really hurts.</p>
<p>Mom, I think he's serious.</p>
<p>Kids are so naive.</p>
<p>Lisa, when you get to be our age, you'll learn a few things.</p>
<p>Like when a sign says, &quot;Do not feed the bears&quot;... man, you'd better not feed the bears.</p>
<p>Now, get to school, boy.</p>
<p>Mrs. Krabappel, I can't take the test. I have a stomachache.</p>
<p>Well, that's a lame excuse for an excuse.</p>
<p>Look, if you ignore me and I die, you'll get in a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>Read page six of the school charter.</p>
<p>&quot;No teacher shall be held accountable if Bart Simpson dies.&quot;</p>
<p>We're also absolved if Milhouse gets eaten by the school snake.</p>
<p><strong>Milhouse</strong>: Hey, cool, there's a rabbit in here.</p>
<p>Mrs. Krabappel, I'm done failing the test. Can I please go to the nurse?</p>
<p>Gosh, maybe you really are in pain.</p>
<p>Well, it would be cruel not to let you go.</p>
<p>Now you may go.</p>
<p>Lunchlady Doris, why are you here?</p>
<p>Budget cuts. They've even got Groundskeeper Willie teaching French.</p>
<p>Bonjour, you cheese-eating surrender monkeys.</p>
<p>Look, my stomach really hurts.</p>
<p>All I can give you are these chewable Prozac for kids.</p>
<p>Your choice: Manic-Depressive Mouse or the Bluebird of Unhappiness.</p>
<p>Superintendent Chalmers, meet our new school nurse, Lunchlady Doris.</p>
<p>Nice to see you. Seymour, why is that student lying unconscious on the floor?</p>
<p>Well, in many cases, the floor is the best...</p>
<p>Oh, look, here comes Lumpy, the school snake.</p>
<p><strong>Kids</strong>: Help! Help!</p>
<p>Oh, Lord.</p>
<p>Don't worry, son. You'll be fine.</p>
<p>This boy's appendix is inflamed and about to burst... which will make it easier to find once I get in there.</p>
<p>Man, these are primo seats. I could really go for a hot dog.</p>
<p>Homer, this is an operation.</p>
<p>Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs here!</p>
<p>Woo-hoo!</p>
<p>Okay, Bart, I will count to three, and you will be sound asleep.</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>Out like a light.</p>
<p><strong>Hibbert</strong>: Scalpel.</p>
<p><strong>Riviera</strong>: Oopsie. Maybe if I fiddle with these knobs.</p>
<p>Hey, I smell gas.</p>
<p>Pleasant gas.</p>
<p>Night-night gas.</p>
<p>How's my special little guy?</p>
<p>How you feeling, big brother?</p>
<p>Oh, this is wonderful. You're alive.</p>
<p><strong>Bart</strong>: No thanks to you, Homer.</p>
<p>Why, you little...</p>
<p>Now, Homer, please. The boy's just had a very serious operation.</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>Now, Bart, I found the culprit: A jagged, metal cereal O.</p>
<p>Wicked. I got this cool scar.</p>
<p>And I get to miss a week of school.</p>
<p>Dr. Hibbert, can I have my appendix out?</p>
<p>Why not. Follow me, kids.</p>
<p>Nurse, prep these children.</p>
<p>I'm glad you're okay, Bart.</p>
<p>Bleeding Gums Murphy.</p>
<p>Little Lisa. It's good to see you again.</p>
<p>It's been a long time.</p>
<p>My friends call me Bleeding Gums.</p>
<p>How'd you get a name like that?</p>
<p>Let me put it this way. You ever been to the dentist?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Not me.</p>
<p>I suppose I should go to one, but I got enough pain in my life as it is.</p>
<p>What are you here for?</p>
<p>My brother just had his appendix out.</p>
<p>Is he gonna be okay?</p>
<p><strong>Bart</strong>: Hello, I'm Dr. Cheeks.</p>
<p>I'm doing my rounds, and I'm a little behind.</p>
<p>He'll be fine.</p>
<p>Lisa, I sure am glad you dropped by. You're the first visitor I've had.</p>
<p>What about your family?</p>
<p>I don't really have a family.</p>
<p>All I had was a little brother who grew up to become a doctor.</p>
<p>He used to laugh at the most inappropriate times.</p>
<p>I've got an older brother that I'll never see.</p>
<p>He's a jazz musician or some such. Oh, well. Bye-bye.</p>
<p>It must be awful to be all alone in the world.</p>
<p>Well, I always had my music.</p>
<p>I learned at the feet of Blind Willy Witherspoon.</p>
<p>I've been playing jazz for 30 years, and I just can't make a go of it.</p>
<p>I want you to have my saxophone.</p>
<p>This isn't a saxophone, it's an umbrella.</p>
<p>So I've played a umbrella for 30 years?</p>
<p>Why didn't anybody tell me?</p>
<p>We all thought it was funny.</p>
<p>That's not funny.</p>
<p>Then I got my big break. I was on Steve Allen's Tonight! show.</p>
<p>Now, a brilliant jazz musician who's inspired me to do some improv poetry.</p>
<p>Twinkle, twinkle, groovy cat How I wonder where you at.</p>
<p>I really love the way you cook Like me, when I wrote this book.</p>
<p>How to Make Love to Steve Allen.</p>
<p>From the author of Happiness ls a Naked Steve Allen... Journey to the Center of Steve Allen and The Joy of Cooking Steve Allen.</p>
<p><strong>Murphy</strong>: I cut my first and only album, Sax on the Beach.</p>
<p>But then I spent all my money on my $ 1500-a-day habit.</p>
<p>I'd like another Fabergé egg, please.</p>
<p>Sir, don't you think you've had enough?</p>
<p>I'll tell you when I've had enough!</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: When was the last time you worked?</p>
<p>In '86, when I did a guest sh*t on The Cosby Show.</p>
<p>Hey, kids. Meet Grandpa Murphy.</p>
<p>But we have three grandpas already.</p>
<p>This one is a great jazz musician.</p>
<p>They all are.</p>
<p>You see, the kids, they listen to the rap music... which gives them the brain damage.</p>
<p>With their hipping and the hopping and the bipping and the bopping.</p>
<p>So they don't know what the jazz is all about.</p>
<p>You see, jazz is like a Jell-O Pudding Pop.</p>
<p>No. Actually, it's more like Kodak film.</p>
<p>No. Actually, jazz is like the New Coke.</p>
<p>It'll be around forever.</p>
<p>Wow, you've had some career.</p>
<p>Although the moral seems to be that a life of jazz leaves you sad and lonely.</p>
<p>Well, before you came to visit, I would have agreed with you.</p>
<p>This just in: Krusty the Clown staged a press conference today... to defend himself against charges that his products are unsafe... his theme park is a deathtrap... and that he's marketing videos of Tonya Harding's wedding night.</p>
<p>I contend the tourists were decapitated... before they entered the Krustyland House of Knives. Next question.</p>
<p>What about that little boy who got appendicitis from eating your cereal?</p>
<p>To prove that this metal O is harmless, I will personally eat one.</p>
<p>See? There's nothing...</p>
<p>Oh, boy! This thing is shredding my insides!</p>
<p>Krusty, that wasn 't the metal one. That was a regular Krusty- O.</p>
<p>It's poison.</p>
<p>So you all set for your recital?</p>
<p>I sure am. Look.</p>
<p>I stopped brushing my teeth so I can play just like you.</p>
<p>Lisa, honey, music comes from what's in your heart, not what's on your teeth.</p>
<p>Come on, let's jam.</p>
<p>Hey, Moe, what will you give me for an A.A. Chip?</p>
<p>Barney, this is a five-minute chip. It's worth a Pabst.</p>
<p>Baby, you are gonna knock them dead.</p>
<p>Here, take this for luck.</p>
<p>Your sax! Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Now, I have learned that most of the orchestra... is having their appendixes removed.</p>
<p>So without further ado, I give you the remnants... of the Springfield Elementary School orchestra.</p>
<p>On saxophone, Lisa Simpson. On triangle, Martin Prince.</p>
<p>And with a flute up his nose, Ralph Wiggum.</p>
<p>That's some nice fluting.</p>
<p>They'll play &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever.&quot;</p>
<p>Hopefully not forever.</p>
<p>This sucks.</p>

<p>Hey, Bleeding Gums, I was great! And I owe it all to...</p>
<p>What happened to Mr. Murphy?</p>
<p>I'm sorry. He passed away.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Lisa, honey, are you gonna be okay?</p>
<p>Bleeding Gums was my hero, and I never got to tell him how I felt.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sure he knew.</p>
<p>And I'm sure that wherever he is now, he's happy.</p>
<p>But he was the only person who had the same love for music that I do.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Oh, Dad, why did he have to die?</p>
<p>Well, it's like the time that your cat, Snowball, got run over.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Remember, honey?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is, all we have to do... is go down to the pound and get a new jazzman.</p>
<p>Oh, Dad!</p>
<p>Oh. I blew it again.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Hey, Lis, you still upset about that jazz guy?</p>
<p>If it helps, I believe that after you die... you can come back as whatever you want.</p>
<p>I'll be a butterfly.</p>
<p>How come?</p>
<p>Because nobody ever suspects the butterfly.</p>
<p>I didn't burn down the school.</p>
<p>It was the butterfly, I tell you. The butterfly!</p>
<p>He's crazy, boys. Get the Taser.</p>
<p>Maybe I need to talk to somebody with a little more age and wisdom.</p>
<p>Death stalks you at every turn.</p>
<p>Grampa.</p>
<p>Well, it does.</p>
<p>There it is. Death!</p>
<p>It's only Maggie.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>You know, at my age, the mind starts playing tricks. So...</p>
<p>Death!</p>
<p>That's only the cat.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Death!</p>
<p>That's Maggie again, Grampa.</p>
<p>Oh. Where were we? Death!</p>
<p>How come it won't stop hurting?</p>
<p>Lisa, it's normal to be sad when a friend dies.</p>
<p>And Bleeding Gums was a good friend to you.</p>
<p>But nobody is really gone as long as we remember them.</p>
<p>If you really want to preserve his memory... I recommend getting a tattoo. It preserves the things you love.</p>
<p>&quot;Starland Vocal Band&quot;? They suck!</p>
<p>Death!</p>
<p>Isn't anybody gonna show up?</p>
<p>Well, Lisa, we've waited an hour.</p>
<p>Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today... to bid farewell to bl*od and Guts Murphy...</p>
<p>No! It was Bleeding Gums Murphy.</p>
<p>Anyway, Bloody Gums Murphy was quite the sousaphone player...</p>
<p>Saxophone! He was a jazz musician.</p>
<p>You didn't know him. Nobody knew him.</p>
<p>But he was a great man.</p>
<p>And I won't rest until all of Springfield... knows the name Bleeding Gums Murphy.</p>
<p>And I won't rest until I've gotten a hot dog.</p>
<p>Homer, this is a cemetery.</p>
<p>Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs here!</p>
<p>Woo-hoo!</p>
<p>What do you do, follow my husband around?</p>
<p>Lady, he's putting my kids through college.</p>
<p>Good news, Bart. The Krusty-O Cereal Corp... has settled your case for $ 100,000, less, of course, my legal fees.</p>
<p>What kind of legal fees?</p>
<p>Well, for a case this complex... I had to assemble a crack team of lawyers.</p>
<p>Ronald Chaporo, trial attorney.</p>
<p>Albert Dershman, who can hold three billiard balls in his mouth.</p>
<p>How much of the 100 thou do I get?</p>
<p>Five hundred dollars?</p>
<p>Yes, well...</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Glad you're happy. Let's roll.</p>
<p>I can't believe it. Five hundred bucks!</p>
<p>Just think what I can do with that money.</p>
<p>Five hundred dollars on red.</p>
<p><strong>Dealer</strong>: The winner is black.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>I wanna honor Bleeding Gums' memory, but I don't know where to start.</p>
<p>Maybe you could get the local jazz station to do a tribute to him, huh?</p>
<p>Jazz. They just make it up as they go along. I could do that.</p>
<p>That's &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb.&quot;</p>
<p>Okay, then this: That's the same thing.</p>
<p>You replaced &quot;dees&quot; with &quot;do's.&quot;</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>I have a request. I'd like you to do a tribute to Bleeding Gums Murphy.</p>
<p>I'd love to, little sister, but we don't have his album.</p>
<p>What if I could find it?</p>
<p>I'd spin it.</p>
<p>But ain't no one gonna hear it.</p>
<p>Our broadcast range is only 23 feet... which makes us the most powerful jazz station in the entire U.S. Of A.</p>
<p>Gee, your station has a lot of problems.</p>
<p>Tell me about it. Just look at our morning guy.</p>
<p>Hello. This is &quot;Moleman in the Morning.&quot; Good Moleman to you.</p>
<p>Today, part four of our series of the agonizing pain... in which I live every day.</p>
<p>Two hundred and fifty dollars?</p>
<p>But I need that album to honor the memory of Bleeding Gums Murphy.</p>
<p>He's dead? Well, why didn't you say so?</p>
<p>Where am I gonna get $500?</p>
<p>Now drive, Smithers. Drive.</p>
<p>Excuse me, my good man, I have $500 to blow.</p>
<p>What have you got?</p>
<p>Behold the ultimate Pog.</p>
<p>I'll take it.</p>
<p>Lisa, look what I've got. Ta-da!</p>
<p>Bart, I can't believe it. But why?</p>
<p>When I said my stomach hurt, you were the only one who believed me.</p>
<p>Oh, thank you. But $500...</p>
<p>You'll never see that much money again.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? Take a look at this.</p>
<p>I got the album.</p>
<p>Here. You can listen to it on this.</p>
<p>I did the best I could, Bleeding Gums.</p>
<p><strong>Woman (over police radio)</strong>: Attention, all units. Attention, all units.</p>
<p>Poison- gas cloud heading for...</p>
<p>[STATIC ON RADIO]</p>
<p>That's nice. Hey, it's getting cloudy.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>That was for you, Bleeding Gums.</p>
<p>You've made an old jazzman happy, Lisa.</p>
<p>You must avenge my death, Kimba. I mean, Simba.</p>
<p>Luke, I am your father.</p>
<p>This is CNN.</p>
<p>Will you guys pipe down? I'm saying goodbye to Lisa.</p>
<p>We're sorry.</p>
<p>I don't want you to go.</p>
<p>Sorry, but I have to. Goodbye.</p>
<p>Goodbye.</p>
<p>Oh, what the heck. Once more, from the top.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: One more time!</p>
<p><strong>Murphy</strong>: Oh, come on, Lisa.</p>
<p>I got a date with Billie Holiday.</p>
