<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Live from the famous brown sands of Public Beach, Delaware...</p>
<p><em>it's the Grand Nationals of Sand Castle Building... Preview.</em></p>
<p>Oh! Saturday afternoon TV is so boring.</p>
<p>Bikini girls.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Dune buggies.</p>
<p>Hmm!</p>
<p>Daredevil surfers.</p>
<p>Ordinarily this beach would be swarming with them, but not today. Oh, no!</p>
<p>They've all been cleared out to make way for painstaking sand preparation.</p>
<p>That's right, Dick. This year everyone's abuzz about one thing- the absence of Mark Rodkin.</p>
<p>Oh, wait. There he is.</p>
<p>Marge, I'm bored!</p>
<p>Why don't you read something?</p>
<p><em>Because I'm trying to reduce my boredom.</em></p>
<p>You can hand out these flyers for the neighborhood rummage sale.</p>
<p>You'll get some fresh air and exercise.</p>
<p>Eh, I'll do it anyway.</p>
<p>Come on, boy! We're going to see the neighbors.</p>
<p>Good old Evergreen Terrace.</p>
<p>The swankiest street in the classiest part of Pressboard Estates.</p>
<p>If you love it so much, why are you always littering?</p>
<p>It's easier. Duh!</p>
<p>Oh! Howdy, neighbor!</p>
<p>May I spray you with the hose in a playful fashion?</p>
<p>Eh, spray the boy.</p>
<p>Well, ready for the big rummage sale?</p>
<p>Oh, yes, indeed.</p>
<p>I've got nothing but time until they fix that malfunctioning Squishy machine.</p>
<p><em>Hey, I never noticed this place.</em></p>
<p>Dad, it's right across the street from us.</p>
<p>That fancy house will never sell.</p>
<p>Nobody who could afford it would want to live in this neighborhood.</p>
<p>Hey, what's wrong with this neighborhood? Big sh*t!</p>
<p>Too good to buy a house here, snobby?</p>
<p>Who you talking to, Homer?</p>
<p>The guy who doesn't live there.</p>
<p>Can we get rid of this ayatollah T-shirt?</p>
<p>Khomeini died years ago.</p>
<p>But, Marge, it works on any ayatollah-</p>
<p>Ayatollah Nakhbadeh, Ayatollah Zahedi.</p>
<p>As we speak, Ayatollah Razmara and his cadre of fanatics are consolidating their power.</p>
<p>I don't care who's consolidating their power.</p>
<p>Well, we don't need this.</p>
<p>Marge, that's the Rhinestone Nights Fashion g*n!</p>
<p>I need it to rhinestone up my old clothing.</p>
<p>Who's &quot;Disco Stu&quot;?</p>
<p>Oh. Well, I wanted to write &quot;Disco Stud,&quot; but I ran out of space.</p>
<p>Not that Disco Stu didn't get his share of the action.</p>
<p>So, if you're looking for a half bag of charcoal briquettes... or an artificial Christmas tree, trunk only... come on over to the Hibbert table, pronto!</p>
<p>Well, sir, looks like we got some nice items here at Table Glick.</p>
<p>Like this. What the heckaroonie is this, Mrs. Glick?</p>
<p>It is a candy dish, Ned. Ninety dollars.</p>
<p>Uh-huh. Well, I, uh- I guess you could put a lot of nice things in there.</p>
<p>No! Just candy, Ned. Ninety dollars!</p>
<p>Well, looks like somebody sold something today.</p>
<p>Are you interested in that motorized tie rack, Principal Skinner?</p>
<p>Hmm. It's awfully loud.</p>
<p>Well, you can always take the motor out... and use it as an ordinary tie rack.</p>
<p>But now the ties are motionless.</p>
<p>Those in back are virtually inaccessible.</p>
<p>Well, it's a moot point as I have only one tie to begin with.</p>
<p>I believe I'll pass.</p>
<p>Have you sold that tie rack yet?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I'll take it.</p>
<p>Now, folks, nothing spells fun... like rhinestones on a dungaree jacket.</p>
<p>Stu, you should buy that.</p>
<p>Hey. Disco Stu doesn't advertise.</p>
<p>Uh, hey, Ned, let me help you with that.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody! Who thinks Flanders should shut up?</p>
<p>So, anyone here from Evergreen Terrace?</p>
<p>I think this is the best neighborhood in town.</p>
<p>Anybody agree with me?</p>
<p>You're the king, Homer!</p>
<p>King of the neighborhood!</p>
<p>Say, that ayatollah thinks he's better than America. Is he right?</p>
<p><em>No!</p>
<p>Yes.</em></p>
<p>For only five dollars, you can sock it to him in style.</p>
<p>Right here!</p>
<p>And for the man who has everything, a tie-rack motor.</p>
<p>I'll take that.</p>
<p>Hey, big spender.</p>
<p>Dig this blender.</p>
<p>Rainbow suspenders.</p>
<p>Hey, big spender.</p>
<p>We surrender.</p>
<p>Spend.</p>
<p>Some dough at table three.</p>
<p>Thank you, neighbors. Thank you.</p>
<p>Now, let's give it up for table five!</p>
<p>Ah, ah, ah, ah Table five, table five.</p>
<p>Ah, ah, ah, ah.</p>
<p>Table fi-i-i-ive.</p>
<p>Table five.</p>
<p>Table five.</p>
<p>Hey, what's the big deal?</p>
<p>It's just some new guy moving in.</p>
<p>Disco Stu likes disco music.</p>
<p>Hi there, neighbors. Uh, I'm George Bush.</p>
<p>Former president George Bush?</p>
<p><em>Oh, former president George Bush!</em></p>
<p>Okay, let's give it up for the new guy!</p>
<p>Now, let's all turn around and pay attention to me again.</p>
<p>Hello. Hello!</p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Wow! A former president living right across the street!</p>
<p>Oh, why did he have to move in on my territory? Look at him.</p>
<p>Thinks just because he led the free world he can act like a big sh*t!</p>
<p>Stupid president! Why couldn't he just stay in his own state?</p>
<p>Actually, this is one of the nine states where Mr. Bush claims residency, Dad.</p>
<p>I wouldn't have voted for him, but it's nice to have a celebrity in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. If Lisa didn't vote for him, and I didn't vote for him-</p>
<p>You didn't vote for anybody.</p>
<p>I voted for Prell to go back to the old glass bottle.</p>
<p>After that, I became deeply cynical.</p>
<p>And your business here, Mr. Flanders?</p>
<p>Well, sir, I'm welcoming the Bushes on behalf of the neighborhood association.</p>
<p>Never mind about that, Ray.</p>
<p>Just give 'em a quick pass with the metal detector and let 'em on in.</p>
<p>Hey, Bar! The neighbors are here.</p>
<p>Howdilly-doodilly there, President Bush-</p>
<p>Or should I say President Neighbor?</p>
<p>I'm Ned Flanders, and this is Maude, Rod and Todd.</p>
<p>Howdilly-doodilly yourself there, Ned. This is my wife, Barbara.</p>
<p>Call her Bar. Would you like some lemonade?</p>
<p>Tiptop-notch!</p>
<p>k*ll.</p>
<p>k*ll.</p>
<p>Greatalicious.</p>
<p>Scrumpdiddlerific.</p>
<p>Fine and dandy like sour candy!</p>
<p>Bar's a whiz with cold drinks, aren't you, Bar?</p>
<p>Don't understand lemonade myself. Not my forte.</p>
<p>What brings you to Springfield?</p>
<p>George and I just wanted to be private citizens again... go where nobody cared about politics.</p>
<p>So we found the town with the lowest voter turnout in America.</p>
<p>Just happy to be here among good, average people... with no particular hopes or dreams.</p>
<p>But, Mr. President, we're not all good people.</p>
<p>There's one little boy you should watch out for.</p>
<p>He's a bad, bad little boy.</p>
<p>Now, Todd, don't scare the president.</p>
<p>Oh, look at those phonies sucking up to Bush.</p>
<p>I guess you might say he's barking up the wrong Bush.</p>
<p>There it is, Homer. The cleverest thing you'll ever say, and nobody heard it.</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p><em>Just gonna relax with my U.S. News &amp; World whatnot.</em></p>
<p>Oh, good. Roasting the new guy.</p>
<p>Hello, Mr. Bush!</p>
<p><em>George, this is a neighborhood boy, Bart Simpson.</em></p>
<p>He came over to say hi.</p>
<p>Yeah. Hello.</p>
<p>Hi! Hey, what's this?</p>
<p>My electric card shuffler. Don't go near that-</p>
<p><em>Now, I told you- Oh, those cards are from Air Force One...</em> and they only give you so many packs.</p>
<p>Oh, George! Boys will be boys. Bart's just being friendly.</p>
<p>Why don't you get off that sofa and show Bart your photos?</p>
<p>Oh, but he'll g*n 'em all up.</p>
<p>His hands are probably covered with mud and cookies.</p>
<p>He probably stole a napkin.</p>
<p>Who's that, George?</p>
<p>That's me with Charlton Heston.</p>
<p>He was-</p>
<p>Who's that, George?</p>
<p>You wouldn't know him. That's Bob Mosbacher. He was secretary of-</p>
<p>That's a dumb name. Who's that, George?</p>
<p>Maybe he thinks &quot;Bart&quot; is a dumb-</p>
<p>How many times were you president, George?</p>
<p>Just once.</p>
<p>Bar, isn't it time for dinner yet?</p>
<p><em>I'm making rice. It'll be a while.</em></p>
<p>Did your Secret Service g*ons ever whack anybody, George?</p>
<p>You know, in my day... little boys didn't call their elders by their first names.</p>
<p>Yeah? Well, welcome to the 20th century, George.</p>
<p>I'll kick you right out of the 20th century, you little-</p>
<p>Oh, man. I only got one minute till they stop serving those breakfast balls! D'oh!</p>
<p>Ah, let's see now. What do you folks have here, huh?</p>
<p>Hmm. A Krusty Burger. That doesn't sound too appetizing.</p>
<p>What kind of stew do you have today?</p>
<p>Uh, we don't have stew.</p>
<p>Sir, why don't you just have the cheeseburger?</p>
<p>That's really more of a weekend thing, Ray.</p>
<p>Hey, jerk! Move your fanny!</p>
<p>That guy's louder than World w*r II.</p>
<p>Ray, go see what the rhubarb is, will you?</p>
<p>Sir, could you pop your hood?</p>
<p>Hey, my taxes paid for that horn!</p>
<p>Why, hello, Mrs. Bush.</p>
<p>Hi, Bart. Mr. Bush is upstairs napping.</p>
<p>Your husband's awful grumpy.</p>
<p>Oh, that's just his way. He really likes you.</p>
<p>You know, it's time for him to get up and work on his memoirs.</p>
<p><em>Why don't you go wake him?</p>
<p>What the-</em></p>
<p>Great Scott! Don't touch that. That's the alpenhorn Helmut Kohl gave me.</p>
<p>Where'd you get those pajamas?</p>
<p>They're presidential pajamas.</p>
<p>You have to be president, and you're not president.</p>
<p>Yes, I am.</p>
<p>D- No, you're not. Bar!</p>
<p>Hey, where's your candy?</p>
<p>We don't have any. Now, go away!</p>
<p>George!</p>
<p>Older people don't eat much candy, Bart, but I could bake you some cookies.</p>
<p><em>Can't remember the last time she made cookies for me.</em></p>
<p>What's that?</p>
<p>Oh, n-nothing.</p>
<p>All right. His story checks out.</p>
<p>Marge, would you love me more if I were president?</p>
<p>'Cause I'll do it if it'll make you happy.</p>
<p>Homie, as long as you keep the car full of gas, I'm happy.</p>
<p>Well, you can always depend on that.</p>
<p>And since I'd achieved... all my goals as president in one term... there was no need for a second.</p>
<p><em>The end.</em></p>

<p>Mmm. Good memoirs.</p>
<p>Good, not great.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at that old outboard.</p>
<p>Soup that baby up, rattle a few windows down Kennebunkport next May.</p>
<p>Hello, Mr. Bush!</p>
<p>What ya doin'?</p>
<p>Now, don't upset the desk there.</p>
<p>Careful! You don't want to horse around with-</p>
<p>Hey, cool! What does this do?</p>
<p>Now, don't you pull that cord, young man!</p>
<p><em>No, no. Hey.!</p>
<p>Whoops.</em></p>
<p>Bar, my motor's gone loco!</p>
<p>Oh, the birdhouse! My prize orchids!</p>
<p><em>No. Not the memoirs. Don't even think about it.</em></p>
<p>Not gonna happen.</p>
<p>Whoa, man.</p>
<p>Whoa nothing.</p>
<p>I'm gonna do something your daddy should've done a long time ago.</p>
<p>Now, go home and think about what you've done, young man.</p>
<p>He spanked you?</p>
<p>You? Bart Simpson?</p>
<p>I begged him to stop, but he said it was for the good of the nation.</p>
<p>Big deal! When I was a pup, we got spanked by presidents till the cows came home.</p>
<p>Grover Cleveland spanked me on two nonconsecutive occasions!</p>
<p>Grampa, I know in your day spanking was common... but Homer and I just don't believe in that kind of punishment.</p>
<p>And that's why your no-good kids are running wild!</p>
<p>First, Bush invades my home turf, then he takes my pals... then he makes fun of the way I talk... probably.</p>
<p>Now he steals my right to raise a disobedient, smart-alecky son!</p>
<p>Well, that's it!</p>
<p>Hey, Bush! Get out here!</p>
<p>Excuse me, sir. Where are you going?</p>
<p>I'm going to punch George Bush in the face.</p>
<p>Okay. Is he expecting you?</p>
<p>You owe me an apology!</p>
<p>Hey, you owe me an apology.</p>
<p>If you were any kind of a father...</p>
<p><em>you'd have disciplined that boy a long time ago.</em></p>
<p>You want to step back, sir? You're trampling the flowers.</p>
<p>Ooh! Hiding behind your g*ons, eh, Bush?</p>
<p>Whoa! Well, you are a wimp!</p>
<p>Wimp, am I?</p>
<p>Agent Johnson, Agent Heintz... you men stand down.</p>
<p>All right, mister, you want trouble, you're gonna get trouble.</p>
<p>Oh, I want trouble, all right.</p>
<p><em>Then you're gonna get trouble.</p>
<p>No, you're gonna get trouble.</em></p>
<p>Oh, that's good. That's good, 'cause I want trouble.</p>
<p>Then we're agreed. There'll be trouble.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah! Lots of trouble.</p>
<p>Trouble it is!</p>
<p>For you.</p>
<p><em>D'oh!</em></p>
<p>This is gonna be sweet.</p>
<p>Two hundred bottle rockets, and George Bush doing toe touches by an open window.</p>
<p><em>You get one up his butt, it's a million points.</p>
<p>Why don't you just say you're sorry, George?</em></p>
<p>Because I'm right. Oh, no.</p>
<p>I'm gonna fix their wagon good. I've pulled some pranks in my time.</p>
<p><em>I- I don't understand.</p>
<p>Are you saying you and Barbara are bad neighbors?</em></p>
<p>No! That's not Bar and me. It's them.</p>
<p>Who? Maude and me?</p>
<p>No! The man and his boy.</p>
<p>You know, the- the boy is named Bart.</p>
<p>I don't know the name of the man. Bar! What's the name of the man?</p>
<p><em>I'm not getting involved, George.</p>
<p>Look, just never mind.</em></p>
<p>I thought the banner was pretty straightforward, but I guess I'll just take it down.</p>
<p><em>George, it's time to get dressed.</em></p>
<p>Nuh-uh. Not going outside today, not with those neighbors.</p>
<p>Staying right here till my speech to the Elks Club.</p>
<p><em>Yoo-hoo.!</p>
<p>Who is it?</p>
<p>It's your sons, George Bush Jr. and Jeb Bush.</p>
<p>Come outside, Dad.</p>
<p>Oh, good.</em></p>
<p>Bar! The boys are in the front yard. They'll help me think of a plan to get those Simpsons.</p>
<p>Oh, George! Is that all you ever think about?</p>
<p>The boys probably just want a letter of recommendation.</p>
<p>Boys? Where are you going?</p>
<p>Okay, son. Give him the glue!</p>
<p><em>Hey, lookin'good.!</p>
<p>And that's why I will continue to oppose teen alcoholism...</em> in all its forms.</p>
<p>Now, are there any questions?</p>
<p>Keeping in mind that I already explained about my hair.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, that's right. The Simpsons.</p>
<p>President Bush is driving on our lawn.</p>
<p>He must be lost.</p>
<p>He's not lost.</p>
<p>Looks like we're experiencing some blowback from the wig offensive.</p>
<p>It's time to hit him where he lives.</p>
<p>His house?</p>
<p>Bingo.</p>
<p>So I thought to myself, &quot;What would God do in this situation?&quot;</p>
<p>Locusts. They'll drive him nuts.</p>
<p>It's all in the Bible, son. It's the prankster's bible.</p>
<p>Hmm. I can't decide if this'll be considered feisty or crazy.</p>
<p>Hey! Hey, what the-</p>
<p>Oh, if he thinks George Bush'll stay out of the sewer... he doesn't know George Bush.</p>
<p>Hey, turkeys! Behind ya.</p>
<p>For the last time, Bush, apologize for spanking my boy!</p>
<p>Never. You make him apologize for destroying my memoirs.</p>
<p>You didn't tell me you destroyed his memoirs.</p>
<p>Never!</p>
<p>Yea, Dad!</p>
<p>I really feel awful about your lawn, Marge.</p>
<p>George can be so stubborn when he thinks he's right.</p>
<p>Oh, Homer too. They're so much alike.</p>
<p>Too bad they got off on the wrong foot.</p>
<p>It's just like the Noriega thing.</p>
<p>Now he and George are the best of friends.</p>
<p>Here's a little something we learned in C.I.A.</p>
<p>Get him, boys!</p>
<p>Ow! Ow!</p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Now I'll ruin you like a Japanese banquet.</p>
<p>I'll take your head and- Gorbachev?</p>
<p>What-What are you doing here?</p>
<p>I just dropped by with present for warming of house.</p>
<p>Instead find you grappling with local oaf.</p>
<p>Oh, brought some of your commie friends to help you fight dirty, eh?</p>
<p>Mikhail, they put a wig on my head, my memoirs got-</p>
<p><em>George, this is the last straw.!</em></p>
<p>You apologize to Homer right now!</p>
<p>But, Bar, we can't show any weakness in front of the Russians.</p>
<p>George!</p>
<p>Yes, dear.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I spanked your boy, Homer.</p>
<p>Whoo-hoo! In your face, Bush.</p>
<p>Now apologize for the tax hike.</p>
<p>It's a shame it didn't work out, Marge... but George just felt this neighborhood brought out the worst in him and-</p>
<p>Oh, my. Well, so long!</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Pleased to meet you. I just moved in.</p>
<p>My name is Jerry Ford.</p>
<p>Former president Gerald Ford?</p>
<p>Put 'er there. I'm Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>Say, Homer, do you like football?</p>
<p>Do I ever!</p>
<p>Do you like nachos?</p>
<p>Yes, Mr. Ford.</p>
<p>Well, why don't you come over and watch the game... and we'll have nachos and then some beer?</p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p>Jerry, I think you and I are gonna get along just-</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
