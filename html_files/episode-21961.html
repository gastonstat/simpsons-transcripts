<p>[ Sighs ] I can't.</p>
<p>Why?</p>

<p>And as soon as I can prove it, I'm shipping you off... to the Christian Military Reform School.</p>

<p>Oh, I see. If you testify, Skinner will know you skipped school.</p>
<p>Well, if Freddy Quimby didn't do it...</p>
<p>I'm sure he'll be found innocent by a fair and impartial jury.</p>

<p>I intend to prove that Freddy Quimby is totally innocent.</p>
<p>First of all, his accuser is a very shady character.</p>
<p>That waiter, Mr. LaCoste, not only wasn't born in Springfield... he wasn't even born in this country!</p>
<p>[ Gasping, Murmuring ]</p>
<p>It's an exclusive.!</p>
<p>From now on, you tell me everything.</p>
<p>Uh, Freddy Quimby was with me the entire... night in question.</p>
<p>We were collecting canned goods for the starving people in... uh, you know, one of them loser countries.</p>
<p>Well, that clears Quimby.</p>
<p>He's clearly innocent.</p>
<p>Oh, good. My laundry is done.</p>
<p>You see, Lisa? They don't need my testimony.</p>
<p>Only because Mayor Quimby is buying his nephew's freedom.</p>
<p>[ Sighs ] The system works. Just ask Claus von Bulow.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to prove to you not only that Freddy Quimby is guilty... but that he is also innocent of not being guilty.</p>
<p>I refer you to my expert witness, Dr. Hibbert.</p>
<p>Well, only one in two million people has... what we call the &quot;evil gene.&quot;</p>
<p>h*tler had it. Walt Disney had it.</p>
<p>And Freddy Quimby has it.</p>
<p>Thank you, Dr. Hibbert. I rest my case.</p>
<p>You rest your case?</p>
<p>What? Oh, no. I thought that was just a figure of speech.</p>
<p>Case closed.</p>
<p>Excuse me, Your Honor. Yes, I'd like to bring something to the court's attention.</p>
<p>[ Snoring ]</p>
<p>Huh? What?</p>
<p>Give those glasses to the bailiff.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And those.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Your Honor, even though I've proven my client's innocence...</p>
<p>I'd still like to call Freddy Quimby to the stand... so that we can all bask in his gentle decency.</p>
<p>He's wealthy, therefore, inherently good.</p>
<p>[ Woman ] Yes, innocent.</p>
<p>Mr. Quimby, did you as*ault Mr. LaCoste?</p>
<p>Of course not. I love each and every living thing on God's green earth.</p>
<p>Well, therefore, you certainly would never lose your temper... over something as trivial as the pronunciation of&quot;chowder.&quot;</p>
<p>That's &quot;chowdah!&quot; &quot;Chowdah!&quot; I'll k*ll you!</p>
<p>I'll k*ll all of you! Especially those of you in the jury!</p>
<p>[ Gasps, Murmuring ]</p>
<p>He's clearly guilty.</p>
<p>Wow, that didn't go well. The defense rests.</p>
<p>Will the jury retire and come to its decision?</p>
<p>[ Chuckles ] This won't take long.</p>
<p>He's clearly guilty. We'll probably be home by dinnertime.</p>
<p>Good. Tonight, the dog from Frasier is gonna ride the dolphin on SeaQuest.</p>
<p>Well, Bart, because of you... a horrible yet innocent person is going to jail.</p>
<p>Hmm. Maybe I should come forward.</p>
<p>Oh, I can't wait till the sentencing part. That's where I really shine.</p>
<p>Bart Simpson, for the heinous crime of hooky...</p>
<p>I sentence you to a lifetime of hard labor in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>[ Raspy Voice ] More creamed corn,Jimbo Jr.?</p>
<p>This creamed corn tastes like creamed crap.</p>
<p>Watch the potty mouth, honey.</p>
<p>[ Sighs ]</p>
<p>Your sister says you have something to tell me.</p>
<p>What? Uh--</p>
<p>Um, yeah. Oh, I just-- I just wanted to say how great it is... to finally see some chicks on the bench.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work, toots.</p>
<p>[ Laughs ]</p>
<p>[ Groans ]</p>
<p>[ Chuckles ] Chicks on the bench.</p>
<p>Why bother votin'? He's guilty.</p>
<p>Well, we might as well make it official.</p>
<p>What does &quot;sequestered&quot; mean?</p>
<p>If the jury is deadlocked, they are put in a hotel together... so they can't communicate with the outside world.</p>
<p>What does &quot;deadlocked&quot; mean?</p>
<p>It's when the jury can't agree on a verdict.</p>
<p>Uh-huh. And &quot;if'?</p>
<p>A conjunction meaning... &quot;in the event that&quot; or &quot;on condition that.&quot;</p>
<p>So if we don't all vote the same way... we'll be deadlocked... and have to be sequestered... in the Springfield Palace Hotel.</p>
<p>That's not gonna happen, Homer.</p>
<p>Let's vote. My liver is failing.</p>
<p>Where we'll get: a free room, free food, free swimming pool... free HBO-- Ooh! Free Willy.!</p>
<p>Justice is not a frivolous thing, Simpson.</p>
<p>It has little, if anything, to do with a disobedient whale.</p>
<p>Now let's vote.</p>
<p>Uh, how are the rest of you voting?</p>
<p>Guilty.</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>How many S's in &quot;innocent&quot;?</p>
<p>[ Groaning ]</p>
<p>I'm only doing what I think is right.</p>
<p>I believe Freddy Quimby should walk out of here a free hotel.</p>
<p>Oh, I miss you too, Marge.</p>
<p>But the law needs me. I'll be home as soon as I can.</p>
<p>Room service, send up two more pot roasts... and three more pillows with mints on 'em.</p>
<p>You know, [ Chuckles ] we're kind of like the original Odd Couple.</p>
<p>You're the messy one, and I'm--</p>
<p>Shut up!</p>
<p>Oh, yes. Very well.</p>

<p>You gotta tell him what you saw, Billy.</p>
<p>But I'm so scared, McGarnigal.</p>
<p>You gotta do this one for me, Billy. McGarnigal.</p>
<p>Okay. For you, McGarnigal.</p>
<p>Well, McGarnigal, Billy is dead!</p>
<p>They slit his throat from ear to ear.</p>
<p>Hey, I'm trying to eat lunch here.</p>
<p>Hey, I'm trying to eat lunch here.</p>
<p>Jump, Free Willy!Jump.</p>
<p>Jump with all your might.</p>
<p>Ahh-- [ Screams ]</p>
<p>[ Splats ]</p>
<p>[ Woman ] Oh, no. Willy didn't make it!</p>
<p>And he crushed our boy!</p>
<p>[ Man ] Ugh! What a mess.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>I don't like this new director's cut.</p>
<p>[ Straining ]</p>
<p>Got it, Barn?</p>
<p>[ Barney ] Got what?</p>
<p>[ Crashes ]</p>
<p>Ow.!</p>
<p>You're stealing a table?</p>
<p>I'm not stealin' it.</p>
<p>Hotels expect you to take a few things. It's a souvenir.</p>
<p>Ah. Is that my necktie you're wearing?</p>
<p>Souvenir.</p>
<p>♪ [ Humming ]</p>
<p>Mom, what if there's a really bad, crummy guy... who's going to jail, but I know he's innocent.</p>
<p>Well, Bart, your Uncle Arthur used to have a saying... &quot;sh**t 'em all, and let God sort 'em out.&quot;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, one day he put his theory into practice.</p>
<p>It took 7 5 federal marshals to bring him down.</p>
<p>Now, let's never speak of him again.</p>
<p>♪ [ Humming ]</p>
<p>Mom? Mom!</p>
<p>Mom!</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>What if I can get this guy off the hook?</p>
<p>I mean, sh-should I do it?</p>
<p>Honey, you should listen to your heart and not the voices in your head... like a certain uncle did one gray December morn.</p>
<p>♪ [ Humming ]</p>
<p>[ Sighs ]</p>
<p>Even though reopening a trial at this point... is illegal and grossly unconstitutional...</p>
<p>I just can't say no to kids.</p>
<p>So, young man... if Freddy Quimby didn't inflict these injuries on Mr. LaCoste... just who did?</p>
<p>Well, I was hiding in the kitchen when it all happened.</p>
<p>Say it, Frenchy.! Say &quot;chowdah';!</p>
<p>Never!</p>
<p>Okay, you asked for it.</p>
<p>I'm gonna enjoy this.</p>
<p>[ Grunting ]</p>
<p>[ Snapping ]</p>
<p>Ow, ooh. Ow, ooh. Ow, ooh.</p>
<p>And that's what really happened.</p>
<p>This is an outrage!</p>
<p>I am not a clumsy Clouseau-esque waiter!</p>
<p>I will-- Whoa! Whoo! Whoo!</p>
<p>[ Screaming ]</p>
<p>Ooh.! Ow.! Ow.! Ow.!</p>
<p>At least there were no big ones.</p>
<p>[ Loud Clamp ]</p>
<p>Ay.</p>
<p>How could you have seen all this, Bart? Weren't you supposed to be in school?</p>
<p>[ Inhales ]</p>
<p>I... sorta skipped school.</p>
<p>I knew it! I knew you'd slip up sooner or later, Simpson!</p>
<p>What slipup? What are you talking about?</p>
<p>He confessed it.</p>
<p>Quiet. I need this.</p>
<p>This court finds Freddy Quimby innocent of all charges.</p>
<p>Case dismissed.</p>
<p>[ Cheering ]</p>
<p>Bart, I'm impressed with what you did in there.</p>
<p>You testified for the Quimby boy, even though it was putting your own head in a noose.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you skipped school.</p>
<p>I guess the two things cancel each other out, huh.</p>
<p>[ Sighs ] I'm a small man in some ways, Bart.</p>
<p>A small, petty man.</p>
<p>Three months detention.</p>
<p>[ Groans ]</p>
<p>Wait a minute, Bart.</p>
<p>Make that... four months detention. four months detention.</p>
<p>[ Homer ] Well, Marge, it was horrible.</p>
<p>Everyone was against me in that jury room.</p>
<p>But I stood by the courage of my convictions, and I prevailed.</p>
<p>And that's why we had Chinese food for lunch.</p>
<p>Good for you, Homie.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of things happened around here while you were gone.</p>
<p>Great, Marge. I want to hear all about it. [ Chuckles ]</p>
<p>[ Marge ] Give me those.!</p>
<p>[ Glasses Snap, Homer Groans ]</p>
<p>And those.</p>
<p>[ Snap, Groan ]</p>
<p>And those.</p>
<p>[ Snap, Groan ]</p>
<p>[ People Chattering ]</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
