<p>This is the first time I've come to church when it's not part of a big montage of my enemies being whacked.   </p>
<p>Whoa! Hey! Whoa!   </p>
<p>Well, someone looks awfully nice for church.   </p>

<p>Who are you?!    </p>
<p>(GASPS) Reverend Lovejoy!    </p>
<p>And I'm just back from Michigan.    </p>
<p>Can you point accusingly for me?    </p>
<p>You got it.    </p>
<p>This man is a heretic.    </p>
<p>(GASPING)    </p>
<p>(QUIETLY): Oh, no. No, Lisa, don't.    </p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait!    </p>
<p>Surely, we know the reverend is a blessed man who...    </p>
<p>Lisa, I did something bad.    </p>
<p>How bad could it be? Seriously.    </p>
<p>(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)    </p>
<p>Well, look at you, finally paying attention to me.    </p>
<p>One brief announcement: there's a red Honda Civic    </p>
<p>- in the parking lot with its lights on.<br />
- You're losing them.    </p>
<p>He b*rned the Bible.    </p>
<p>(GASPING)    </p>
<p>Oh, boy.    </p>
<p>That's appalling. I mean, come on.    </p>
<p>Psalms are not for burning.<br />
They're for tattoos.    </p>
<p>So, you know, you sicken me.    </p>
<p>Everything in my heart tells me this isn't true!    </p>
<p>I know this is a weird thing to say in church, but we need proof.    </p>
<p>I demand a full hearing in front of all of us!    </p>
<p>Oh, you'll get your hearing.    </p>
<p>Tuesday at  :  .    </p>
<p>Another paradise lost.    </p>
<p>Lisa, you're really bringing down the first Sunday of Lent.    </p>
<p>Even the fire eater is sad.    </p>
<p>The crisis of faith grows as support for im-preach-ment is now at   %.    </p>
<p>Can you fight fire with firing?    </p>
<p>What should we do with this Judas priest?    </p>
<p>This has been Kent Brockman talking, saying nothing.    </p>
<p>- ♪ ♪</p>
<p>Oh.    </p>
<p>(PLAYS SAD NOTES)    </p>
<p>Welcome, all of you. Let's begin.    </p>
<p>Why is<em> she</em> running this?    </p>
<p>Because she won't get overexcited.    </p>
<p>And<em> I</em> will?!    </p>
<p>And the Bible said, &quot;A child shall lead them.&quot;    </p>
<p>Well, as my Lord Buddha said,    </p>
<p>&quot;Three things cannot long be hidden.    </p>
<p>The sun, the moon, and the truth.&quot;    </p>
<p>Well, why don't they make that a Google Doodle?    </p>
<p>Reverend, you're very concerned with the Bible.    </p>
<p>So, let us turn to that Bible.    </p>
<p>Specifically, the very, very, many parts that speak about forgiveness.    </p>
<p>(PLAYING FANFARE)    </p>
<p>And, Mom, thank you for sewing these banners.    </p>
<p>I did all that work for a ten-second bit?    </p>
<p>He did it. He admitted it.    </p>
<p>What else do you need?    </p>
<p>We've mobbed for less, people.    </p>
<p>Yeah, remember the guy with the two different-colored socks?    </p>
<p>Ran his ass right out of town.    </p>
<p>Banish him!    </p>
<p>CROWD: Banish him! Banish him!    </p>
<p>Cherish him! Cherish him!    </p>
<p>I know another long-haired performer who preached a new philosophy, peace and love.    </p>
<p>And the crowd was with him, but then they turned, hard.    </p>
<p>And that man's name was Willie Nelson!    </p>
<p>Well, I say, banish him! Banish him!    </p>
<p>CROWD: Banish him! Banish him!    </p>
<p>Stop!    </p>
<p>I came here to unify you, but instead I divided you.    </p>
<p>So I'm leaving.    </p>
<p>I just hope what I said resonated with a few of you.    </p>
<p>Like Lisa, one who may change the world.    </p>
<p>Aw.    </p>
<p>And that Sea Captain guy.<br />
That dude is surprisingly woke.    </p>
<p>Yarr, activism means nothing if it's not intersectional.    </p>
<p>Yarr!    </p>
<p>Glad to have known you.    </p>
<p>I just want to say, you've changed my life forever.    </p>
<p>You're the first minister I've ever met    </p>
<p>I didn't want to slap across the face.    </p>
<p>Glad to have known you.    </p>
<p>And I just want to say, rot in Hell, Bible burner.    </p>
<p>Glad to have known you.    </p>
<p>- Glad to have...<br />
- Bup-bup-bup.    </p>
<p>In my family, you don't say goodbye to someone you care about without a meat loaf.    </p>
<p>And broccoli.    </p>
<p>You-You're inviting me over for dinner?    </p>
<p>If you can love us after seeing us eat, we'll know you really love us.    </p>
<p>Come on, pal. We're having roast Bible.    </p>
<p>Huh? (LAUGHS)    </p>
<p>What? Too soon?    </p>
<p>(SNORING)    </p>
<p>I just want to offer this simple prayer:    </p>
<p>Dear God, please let the Simpsons never end.    </p>
<p>ALL: Amen.    </p>
<p>And, Bode, tomorrow I have to ask you a philosophical question, so I'll see you at the church.    </p>
<p>Amen.    </p>
<p>Where the hell have you been?    </p>
<p>Why would you burn a Bible?    </p>
<p>Why couldn't you burn Bill O'Reilly's books?    </p>
<p>There are so many.    </p>
<p>I was trying to tell people that God is in your heart, not in a overbuilt cathedral or some book.    </p>
<p>This town doesn't get subtext.    </p>
<p>Our NPR station broadcasts wrestling.    </p>
<p><em>NPR ANNOUNCER: And that's an excruciating half nelson.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Now, is that what's known in the lexicon as a &quot;face stomp&quot;?</em>    </p>
<p><em>NPR ANNOUNCER  : Yes, yes, it is.</em>    </p>
<p><em>NPR ANNOUNCER  : This is NPR pledge week. Please give.</em>    </p>
<p>- Why did you do it?<br />
- I was   .    </p>
<p>I saw how people were using the Bible to divide and exclude.    </p>
<p>People were so busy worshipping a road map instead of trying to reach the destination.    </p>
<p>You know what I mean?    </p>
<p>Well, why didn't you just say that?    </p>
<p>That was fine. No fire.    </p>
<p>- I was   .<br />
- I'm eight and I get it.    </p>
<p>(SIGHS) You're right.    </p>
<p>I've regretted it since the day I did it.    </p>
<p>So, since then, I've just wandered the world, like a millennial on a gap year.    </p>
<p>I understand, but how are you gonna convince...?    </p>
<p>I'll just have faith in this town's open heart.    </p>
<p>(GRUNTS)    </p>
<p>I was just making sure it doesn't say &quot;We forgive you.&quot;    </p>
<p>- It doesn't.<br />
- Unless they wrote it in red.    </p>
<p>Yeah, no.    </p>
<p>- No, they didn't.<br />
- No.    </p>
<p>- The brick<em> is</em> the message.<br />
- Them's my people.    </p>
<p>- Yeah.<br />
- Yeah.    </p>
<p>Do we throw it back? What's your custom?    </p>
<p>Uh, Chief, this guy still had ten minutes on his meter.    </p>
<p>Just when I understood that guy, when I believed again, when I believed in people, they took him away.    </p>
<p>I've lost my faith, Lou.    </p>
<p>Come on, Chief, you got a beautiful wife    </p>
<p>(LAUGHS): and kid... I can't...    </p>
<p>I'm sorry, I can't say that with a straight face.    </p>
<p>- Well, you could try.<br />
- (LAUGHS)    </p>
<p>I am. I-I'm trying, I'm sorry.    </p>
<p>I'm sorry. I'll maybe try again.    </p>
<p>You got a beau... (LAUGHING)    </p>
<p>...tiful wife and kid.    </p>
<p>Shh!</p>
