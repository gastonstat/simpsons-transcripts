<p>(expl*si*n)</p>
<p>Oh, my hallway-walking God!</p>
<p>I've seen my fair share of workplace atrocities, but this one's gonna be hard not to whistle-blow.</p>
<p>Uh, Carlson, how about you forget any k*ll irradiated airborne entities you<em> think</em> you saw   and sign this nondisclosure agreement?</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I have no choice but to speak up and say...</p>
<p>what's in it for me?</p>
<p>Guess who just got two VIP concert tickets to see Bob Seger tonight!</p>
<p>Bob Seger!</p>
<p>Which b*llet Band is he bringing?</p>
<p>Silver!</p>
<p>In that case, I'm closin' shop early.</p>
<p>(HUMMING)</p>
<p>Marge, you know how nothing ever happens to me?</p>
<p>Well, the curse has been lifted!</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I love how excited you are to chaperone the kids' weekend sleepover on the World w*r II battleship.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>Chaperoning?</p>
<p>You can't just spring this on me at the last...</p>
<p>- (YELPING)</p>
<p>- _    D'oh!</p>
<p>Aw, you've got to fill in for me, Marge.</p>
<p>I'd do it for you if you were the husband.</p>
<p>You always get to do the fun thing and leave me holding the bag.</p>
<p>I'll get you a new bag.</p>
<p>A tote from the merch table.</p>
<p>What size are you?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I'm watching the Gen Gala red-carpet arrivals tomorrow.</p>
<p>Can't you just record it and watch it next week when me and Lenny are at the Hall &amp; Oates concert?</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>I'm hosting the watch party.</p>
<p>I have firm commitments from several A-level gays.</p>
<p>We're all gonna make snarky comments    about celebrities' outrageous outfits.</p>
<p>I'm working up the courage to use the B-word on a man.</p>
<p>Okay, honey, I give up.</p>
<p>You host your party.</p>
<p>I go to the concert.</p>
<p>No field trip for the kids.</p>
<p>It was your decision, so I'll let you tell them.</p>
<p>♪ <em>Yo-ho, yo-ho</em> ♪ </p>
<p>♪ <em>A field trip life for me.</em> ♪  </p>
<p>(SIGHS)</p>
<p>(HORN BLARES)</p>
<p>- Whoa!</p>
<p>- Whoa.</p>
<p>Mommy!</p>
<p>Mommy!</p>
<p>I took a bite of my juice box because I forgot!</p>
<p>Ready about, sailors!</p>
<p>Name's Captain Bowditch.</p>
<p>For the next hours, you will be my crew aboard the USS ship with a name we're not allowed to say anymore and with good reason.</p>
<p>Now, the year is     .</p>
<p>We sailors have fought many battles in the Pacific theater, but today we face our most vicious enemy yet: oxidation.</p>
<p>(BOOING)</p>
<p>k*ll those lousy Oxies!</p>
<p>Rust has overtaken the vessel, and I'm giving you three tools to neutralize the threat: wire brushes, marine paint, and the remainder of the weekend.</p>
<p>(SHOUTING EXCITEDLY)</p>
<p>Chaperones, you will stand watch in six-hour shifts.</p>
<p>Now, pair up!</p>
<p>Can you imagine getting stuck with Sarah Wiggum for the whole weekend?</p>
<p>What's she looking for, a personality?</p>
<p>(QUIET LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>So, I guess we should figure out some system to pair up, like...</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>(SIGHS)</p>
<p>Hey, Sarah, we've met before.</p>
<p>I'm Bart's mom, Marge.</p>
<p>- Hi.</p>
<p>- (SIGHS)</p>
<p>So, overnight field trips... the things we do for our kids.</p>
<p>Kids.</p>
<p>So...</p>
<p>have you ever been on a battleship before?</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>We're so close, we can read the labels on the drummer's medications.</p>
<p>Hey, I have that, too.</p>
<p>Mild depression rules!</p>
<p>Eh, nice seats, huh, fellas?</p>
<p>Yeah, Mr. Burns' payoffs are always the best.</p>
<p>Luckily, I was able to get my wife to take over chaperoning some stupid battleship weekend with Ralphie.</p>
<p>Hey, I saddled my wife with that, too.</p>
<p>Marge and Sarah were okay with that?</p>
<p>Ah, they'll be fine.</p>
<p>Wives, they love that World w*r II stuff.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES): Yeah, they're always gifting their husbands books and movies about it, but you know they're really buying it for themselves.</p>
<p> Hmm.</p>
<p> And number ten would be...</p>
<p> oh, &quot;telling a funny story.&quot;   </p>
<p> What are<em> your</em> top ten ways of starting a conversation?</p>
<p> Talking.</p>
<p> (SIGHS)</p>
<p> I guess we should get back to the kids.</p>
<p> They're asleep.</p>
<p> What?</p>
<p> Almost midnight?</p>
<p>How did it get so late?</p>
<p> Oh.</p>
<p>It's only  :  ?</p>
<p> Wait.</p>
<p>Did you move the clock ahead to trick the kids into going to sleep early?</p>
<p> Sarah, I'm impressed.</p>
<p> (GASPS)</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p> A bottle of pocket alcohol.</p>
<p> (EXHALES): Ah...</p>
<p> Dang, this is the last place on earth I want to be.</p>
<p> No offense, Marge, but, geez, this field trip<em> sucks!</em></p>
<p> (GASPS)</p>
<p>You said all those words!</p>
<p> I'm just quiet.</p>
<p> Even though everyone thinks I'm an idiot.</p>
<p> No, no, we don't think you're an idiot.</p>
<p> We just think you're boring.</p>
<p> (GASPS)</p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<p> (LAUGHTER)</p>
<p> Did you bring this from home?</p>
<p> Actually, I got it from Admiral Dingdong's liquor cabinet.</p>
<p> - It wasn't locked?</p>
<p>- Oh, maybe it was.</p>
<p> Uh, wink.</p>
<p> - _ - MARGE: Ooh.</p>
<p> I've never done a swig.</p>
<p> Whoa!</p>
<p> (LAUGHTER)</p>
<p> Oh, Sarah Wiggum, who<em></p>
<p>are</em></p>
<p>you?</p>
<p> I love Clancy, but you have no idea what it's like to be married to a man with a dangerous job he's just not good at.</p>
<p> Actually...</p>
<p> And with the way he eats, each crust he sucks the cheese out of could be his last.</p>
<p> Maybe I do understand.</p>
<p> It just takes so much work to be a mom and a wife <em>and</em></p>
<p>keep the goods in a tight little package, if you catch my drift.</p>
<p> Sometimes it feels like he...</p>
<p> Takes me for granted!</p>
<p> Why do his last-minute man-plans have to ruin the one day of the year where I get to be catty?</p>
<p> (CHUCKLES): Hell yeah, sister.</p>
<p> Well, you know what?</p>
<p>You and me, we're like two fun peas in a party pod.</p>
<p> We should do more hangouts.</p>
<p> Oh, I'd like that, but there's a reason I keep to myself.</p>
<p> Ooh.</p>
<p> (SINGSONGY): Secret reasons.</p>
<p> (GASPS)</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p> What are you doing here?</p>
<p>How did you find me?</p>
<p> Sarah!</p>
<p> Marge!</p>
<p> <em>MARGE: Please take this bag off my head.</em></p>
<p> I think whoever you kidnapped before me was a smoker.</p>
<p>Ugh!</p>
<p> Why did you bring her into it?</p>
<p> She's just some vanilla soccer mom.</p>
<p> She doesn't know anything.</p>
<p> Hey, once I start bagging heads, I can't stop.</p>
<p> Hey, there, Sarah.</p>
<p>I see you're hanging with the Yankee Candle crowd.</p>
<p> Wait.</p>
<p>Y-You know these people?</p>
<p> Marge, meet Bette and Erin.</p>
<p> They're my old partners.</p>
<p> In a throuple?</p>
<p>Who are the original two?</p>
<p> Partners in crime.</p>
<p> You're a criminal?</p>
<p> Jeebus Crackers!</p>
<p> Hi, Mr. Seger.</p>
<p> Boy, you probably don't remember this, but I saw you at an airport once, and I was too nervous to say anything, and then it wasn't you.</p>
<p> We love you, man!</p>
<p>We promised our wives we'd go on some dumb school field trip, but when we got these tickets, we ditched them so fast.</p>
<p> Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p> You broke a promise to your wives?</p>
<p> A good husband's supposed to be &quot;Like a Rock.&quot; Because we're all running &quot;Against the Wind.&quot; Terrible &quot;Night Moves.&quot; Look at this.</p>
<p> Those aren't tour dates.</p>
<p> They're all the times I've kept commitments to my wife.</p>
<p> &quot;Rock and Roll Never Forgets&quot; the needs of his coequal life companion.</p>
<p> You sicken me.</p>
<p> Were... were we just Seger-shamed?</p>
<p> Why, the real silver b*llet is truth.</p>
<p> We're terrible husbands.</p>
<p> I never should have left Marge holding the bag.</p>
<p> We've got to go make it up to Bob Seger.</p>
<p> And our wives.</p>
<p> Sarah, you were a crook?</p>
<p> Everything I never knew or cared to wonder about you has been a lie.</p>
<p> We weren't crooks.</p>
<p>We were thieves.</p>
<p> ♪ <em>A few times I've been around that track</em> ♪   </p>
<p> <em>Sexy, girlie thieves.</em></p>
<p> ♪ <em>I ain't no hollaback girl, I ain't no hollaback...</em> ♪ <em>They never saw us coming,</em></p>

<p> _     Ooh.</p>
<p>Ow.</p>
<p> Hey there, blue boy.</p>
<p> I was walking past your<em></p>
<p>big building</em></p>
<p> and seemed to have sprained my ankle because of my high flops.</p>
<p> Do you happen to have...</p>
<p> - What, a girlfriend?</p>
<p>- ...an icepack?</p>
<p> (BOTH LAUGHING)</p>
<p> I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I'm s...</p>
<p> Of course, of course I do.</p>
<p> Uh, this is just my night job, by the way.</p>
<p> I'm, uh, putting myself through the police academy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p> - Isn't that free?</p>
<p>- Well, the first time, yeah.</p>
<p> I love a man in a rented uniform.</p>
<p> (MOANING)</p>
<p> _     <em>The kiss was part of the plan.</em></p>
<p> <em>But falling head over high flops wasn't.</em></p>
<p> Clancy...</p>
<p> (SIREN WAILING)</p>
<p> - (GASPS)</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>- No, no, don't leave.</p>
<p> Come back to pile.</p>
<p> Uh, I gotta go, blue boy.</p>
<p> - I'm sorry.</p>
<p>- Ah, no problem.</p>
<p> - Oh, um, will you marry me?</p>
<p>- Probably!</p>
<p> (GASPS)</p>
<p> <em>I was supposed to be the getaway driver.</em></p>
<p> <em>My best friends were arrested.</em></p>
<p> And it was all my fault.</p>
<p> Oh, cool your jets.</p>
<p> Yeah, hot jets.</p>
<p> <em>ERIN: It wasn't your fault we got busted.</em></p>
<p> <em>We were set up...</em></p>
<p> - <em>by Red.</em></p>
<p> - (ALARM BLARING)</p>
<p>- (GASPING)</p>
<p> She got away with our whole take, including the Hourglass Diamond.</p>
<p> That backstabbing sack of Spanx.</p>
<p> Wait, so it wasn't my fault you got caught.</p>
<p> Yeah, and if you hadn't gone all horndog on that rent-a-cop, you'd have been locked up, too.</p>
<p> We found Red.</p>
<p> She goes by the name Lindsey Naegle now.</p>
<p> I've heard of her.</p>
<p> She works in various female executive positions around town.</p>
<p> We've got a plan to steal that diamond back from her, and you're gonna help us.</p>
<p> No, I left that life behind me.</p>
<p> I have a husband now, and a son who's smart in a way we haven't figured out yet.</p>
<p> Well, it'd be a real shame if the Chief of Police found out his wife was a common criminal.</p>
<p> (GASPS)</p>
<p>You never told Clancy?</p>
<p> Let's just say he's always been better at planting evidence than finding it.</p>
<p> Why don't I just call him now and tell him everything?</p>
<p> I'm in.</p>
<p> Our wives are missing?</p>
<p> Not unheard of.</p>
<p> Most women have such an idealized version of the Second World w*r in their heads that when they meet the cold, hard reality, they can't face it.</p>
<p> Did you see what happened?</p>
<p> There was but one witness.</p>
<p> Junior Seaman Ralph, give your account of the watch.</p>
<p> The mommies got new face hats, then got into a slidey-door car.</p>
<p> (CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>Don't worry, I speak Ralph.</p>
<p> Face hats?</p>
<p>Slidey-door?</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p> God, they were kidnapped!</p>
<p> - (GASPS)</p>
<p>- And there's only one man bold enough to kidnap the wives of the chief of police and his slightly slimmer acquaintance.</p>
<p> Sarah was kidnapped?</p>
<p> Oh, spare me the act.</p>
<p>We know it was you.</p>
<p> I spare, I swear.</p>
<p> I need your family to be happy and healthy, because who else would I say it would be a shame if something were to happen to?</p>
<p> Okay, but what about one of your cronies?</p>
<p> I assure you, you are a beloved figure amongst my business brethren.</p>
<p> CLANCY: Mm.</p>
<p> (WHISPERS): You look a lot like that guy Chief Bungles.</p>
<p> But there's no other reason to kidnap Sarah.</p>
<p> She's just my little schmoop-a-doop, and that's all there is to her.</p>
<p> Apparently not.</p>
<p>(LAUGHS)</p>
<p> Perhaps your wives were not kidnapped.</p>
<p> Perhaps they left because you are selfish men.</p>
<p> That's the only explanation.</p>
<p> It was all about us.</p>
<p> All right, what's the job?</p>
<p> _     Naegle sold the jewels she ripped off from us and became a fancy socialite.</p>
<p> She kept the biggest rock for herself.</p>
<p> The Hourglass Diamond... it's in her tiara.</p>
<p> And we're gonna steal it back when she wears it to the Gen Gala, tomorrow.</p>
<p> You're gonna rob the Gen Gala?</p>
<p> Sorry, sorry.</p>

<p><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div></p>
<p>Scheme away.</p>
<p> Okay, here's how it's gonna work.</p>
<p> First, we come up through this manhole.</p>
<p> Nope!</p>
<p> Excuse you?</p>
<p> Look, I may not know anything about heists, but I am the world's biggest superfan of the Gen Gala, and your plan won't work.</p>
<p> - And why not?</p>
<p>- If you did any research, you'd know Beyoncé's going to be carried in by plus-size gladiators, who will form a human pyramid right on top of your way in.</p>
<p> No heist.</p>
<p> If you're so Kmart smart, how would you get in?</p>
<p> Well, these entrances will be blocked by fans, press and authorized stalkers.</p>
<p> The best plan would be to put on a crazy dress and sneak in through the red carpet.</p>
<p> Although, you wouldn't get far without a publicist who knows everything about the gala.</p>
<p> - Someone like you?</p>
<p>- Yeah.</p>
<p> This vanilla soccer mom could be our secret w*apon.</p>
<p> Me?</p>
<p>Join the robbery?</p>
<p> (SCOFFS)</p>
<p>No way!</p>
<p> Stealing is one of the big &quot;thou shalt nots.&quot; It's not about the cash.</p>
<p> It's about setting things right.</p>
<p> Lindsey Naegle betrayed us for money and fame, and all we got are bad prison tattoos.</p>
<p> MARGE: Aw, duckies!</p>
<p> Marge, aren't you tired of being underestimated and overlooked?</p>
<p> Together, we can right a wrong     and look damn good doing it.</p>
<p> I've always wanted to say this...</p>
<p> I'm in.</p>
<p> ♪ ♪     _     This is Kent Brockman outside the Museum of Generational Wealth for the annual Gen Gala.</p>
<p> <em>This year's theme is &quot;The Audacity.&quot;</em></p>
<p> <em>A bold contrast to last year's theme:</em></p>
<p> <em>&quot;The Nerve.&quot;</em></p>
<p> <em>But I'm stuck out here,</em></p>
<p> where hundreds of nobodies have gathered to watch <em>dozens of somebodies walk up some stairs.</em></p>
<p> Should we do this without Marge?</p>
<p> This is her favorite watching-party of the year.</p>
<p> (BOOING)</p>
<p> Forget her.</p>
<p>I'm jonesing for snark.</p>
<p> Oh, God, would you look at that dress.</p>
<p> Who is the designer, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch?</p>
<p> - Probably?</p>
<p>- ALL: Ah...</p>
<p> Ah, that's the good shade.</p>
<p> The plan's working.</p>
<p>We look amazing.</p>
<p> Now, let's get those tickets.</p>
<p> _     The    stairs.</p>
<p> The Tanqueray stiletto sharpener.</p>
<p> The Swarovski crystal wheelchair ramp.</p>
<p> - (GASPS)</p>
<p>- Stop gawking.</p>
<p> Where do we let the other girls in?</p>
<p> Right over there, next to...</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p> Rihanna!</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p> I listen to the clean versions of all your songs!</p>
<p> Now, let's see if there's any honey left in this pot.</p>
<p> _     Excuse me, I seemed to have a pulled a muscle.</p>
<p> Do you have an ice pack so that my leg can stop...</p>
<p> - quivering?</p>
<p>- (GULPS)</p>
<p> Right away, ma'am.</p>
<p> Oh-ho, hot stuff.</p>
<p> Ugh, no sign of our wives.</p>
<p> We checked out all their favorite places, but turns out we don't pay enough attention to know what those are.</p>
<p> So I don't know what we did.</p>
<p> It was my distinct pleasure to watch your son.</p>
<p> I find we are quite simpatico.</p>
<p> Both of us know nothin' about nothin'.</p>
<p> JOHNNY TIGHTLIPS: Oh!</p>
<p> Now that's a fluid gender!</p>
<p> I wouldn't mind asking them their preferred pronouns.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p> (GASPS)</p>
<p>If I'm not mistaken, that's how Marge looks when she's happy.</p>
<p> And that's my Sarah!</p>
<p> Come on, Homer.</p>
<p> It looks like this town's got a museum.</p>
<p> _     _     There's Lindsey, and she's wearing the tiara.</p>
<p> Okay, don't be nervous.</p>
<p> - You can do this.</p>
<p>- Nervous?</p>
<p> This is the best field trip of my fricking life!</p>
<p> Ms. Naegle, can I just say, &quot;that dress.&quot; I know, right?</p>
<p>You go, girl.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p> What setting would you even wash that on?</p>
<p> Delicate?</p>
<p>Eco-warm?</p>
<p> I bet it would make so much noise in the dryer, right?</p>
<p> Um, I don't want this to sound harsh, but you're not famous, so you don't exist.</p>
<p> Bye now.</p>
<p> Darling, stop talking to that empty chair and come take a selfie at the Fenty lip gloss fountain.</p>
<p> Oh, it's a fake!</p>
<p> _     I've been robbed!</p>
<p> Somebody stop those two nobodies!</p>
<p> Keep it cool.</p>
<p> We just have to slip out of here without anyone noticing us.</p>
<p> - (SIRENS BLARING)</p>
<p>- (GASPING)</p>
<p> <em>WIGGUM (OVER BULLHORN): Sarah Wiggum, freeze!</em></p>
<p> We're here to give you ladies the attention you deserve!</p>
<p> (PANTING)</p>
<p> Shh!</p>
<p>Now is not the time, Clancy.</p>
<p> No, no, when it comes to love, it's always the time for shouting!</p>
<p> Sar-ah Wig-gum!</p>
<p> Schmoop-a-doop!</p>
<p> Shmoop-ba-da-doopa!</p>
<p> - I love Sa...</p>
<p>- Shut up!</p>
<p> Oh, God, ow.</p>
<p> - Sarah Wiggum, who are you?</p>
<p>- LINDSEY: That's her!</p>
<p> She's the thief!</p>
<p> (YELPS)</p>
<p> (GRUNTING)</p>
<p> (GRUNTING CONTINUES)</p>
<p> (GROANS)</p>
<p> Babe, who is she?</p>
<p> This is my new girlfriend.</p>
<p> You were tumbling for a long time.</p>
<p> Oh, you poor thing.</p>
<p> Here's your bag, sweetie.</p>
<p> Oopsie!</p>
<p> LINDSEY: Those aren't mine!</p>
<p> - My earrings!</p>
<p>- My bl*od diamond!</p>
<p> My conflict tennis bracelet!</p>
<p> _     Oh, this time, leave me holding the bag.</p>
<p> Aw, thanks, Homie.</p>
<p> But they're part of the ensemble.</p>
<p> Chalamet looks like dirt.</p>
<p> BTS looks like seven dirts.</p>
<p> I see nerve there but nothing audacious.</p>
<p> Oh.</p>
<p>My.</p>
<p>God.</p>
<p> Jeebus Crackers!</p>
<p> That's Marge!</p>
<p> What the hell is she doing at the Gen Gala?</p>
<p> Exactly.</p>
<p>She looks like dirt.</p>
<p> It's what she would have wanted.</p>
<p> Oh, Clancy.</p>
<p> So, this whole time, I've been married to a master criminal.</p>
<p> Damn straight.</p>
<p> (BOTH MOANING)</p>
<p> Wait, wait, uh, where's Ralph?</p>
<p> I must confess, I thought putting crushed-up Oreos into the cookies and cream yogurt would be redundant.</p>
<p> Instead, it is transcendent.</p>
<p> (CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>I like to smoosh the gummy bears.</p>
<p> Hey, no touching!</p>
<p> If the boy wants to smoosh, the boy will smoosh.</p>
<p> I love you, scary daddy.</p>
<p> I love you too, Ralphie &quot;Stickie Hands.&quot; </p>
<p> Shh!</p>
