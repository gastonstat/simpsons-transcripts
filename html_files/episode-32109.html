							<p>Hey.</p>
<p>D'oh! Aw.</p>
<p>And that's amore.</p>
<p>Let the word go forth.</p>
<p>With the kids gone for the summer, we have snuggled in every room in the house.</p>
<p>Thank you, Kamp Krusty.</p>
<p>Um, excuse me.</p>
<p>Um, putting on a little weight there, huh, Chief? </p>
<p>Our freezer broke, Lou.</p>
<p>Any bacon we buy we have to eat it all and right away.</p>
<p>Uh, now, Simpson, we received an anonymous call about a gong.</p>
<p>Chief Wiggum, can't a man enjoy the company of his wife in his own son's tree house? </p>
<p>What, you didn't see the sign? </p>
<p>Hmm? </p>
<p>That's just some nonsense a kid wrote, Chief.</p>
<p>That is what they said about the Declaration of Independence, Lou.</p>
<p>Uh, who said that? </p>
<p>King Shut The Hell Up.</p>
<p>Look, we're married.</p>
<p>This is our home, and our kids are fine.</p>
<p>Hail to thee, Kamp Krusty.</p>
<p>Death to tennis camp! </p>
<p>I can't believe it's been six weeks since we've seen the kids.</p>
<p>Ooh, I wonder if Bart has a mustache.</p>
<p>Your kids are back.</p>
<p>Except for the Johnsons', who I need to speak to privately.</p>
<p>I have lemon-lime disease! </p>
<p>The basketball teams were skin versus bones.</p>
<p>I'm tellin' ya, it was a real rough camp.</p>
<p>I see you're sucking your thumb again.</p>
<p>Kirk, you said he'd stopped.</p>
<p>Uh Kirk, we discussed this.</p>
<p>It's the only vice I can afford! </p>
<p>Oh, my poor, poor babies.</p>
<p>Do you know what kids get after a scary experience? </p>
<p>Ice cream! </p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Counseling.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>Kids, you've been through a horrible experience, but there is good news at the end of that pain-bow.</p>
<p>A pot of goals.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>How long you gonna talk this way? </p>
<p>Well, let's just say I wish eyes were smiling.</p>
<p>Now, kids, how bad could it have really been? </p>
<p>Hey, Doc, I'm fine.</p>
<p>But other kids in my generation, I love 'em, but they're total wusses.</p>
<p>Well, every night, they showed us The Parent Trap.</p>
<p>I mean, what kind of parents break up twins and never tell them the other exists?! </p>
<p>Oh, that's Disney magic.</p>
<p>Now, you all need to decompress, so it is essential you do not go right back to school.</p>
<p>No school? </p>
<p>No school? </p>
<p>On second thought, I'm fine.</p>
<p>Look, I can sit with my chair turned around, just like you.</p>
<p>I knew one day there'd be another.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Go with God.</p>
<p>Bart, are you coming? </p>
<p>Ooh, definitely no school for you.</p>
<p>Or church.</p>
<p>Mrs.</p>
<p>Simpson, I would watch him very closely for the next couple of days.</p>
<p>Geez, I was thinking about taking him shopping for school clothes.</p>
<p>Why not just buy a suit for his coffin.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Uh, somebody parked me in.</p>
<p>Toyota Corolla.</p>
<p>Well, it's got to be one of you.</p>
<p>Try the karate studio.</p>
<p>I tried the damn karate studio.</p>
<p>All right, it's me.</p>
<p>I blocked you in.</p>
<p>Okay? Sorry.</p>
<p>Okay, time to fake me some PTSD.</p>
<p>And maybe bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>Eh, too far.</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know, Homie.</p>
<p>The kids seem upset.</p>
<p>Oh, they'll be fine.</p>
<p>Marge, children and summer are natural enemies.</p>
<p>Now, why don't we mix things up? </p>
<p>Tonight I'll be Penn and you be Teller.</p>
<p>Oh, okay! Uh! Teller doesn't talk.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Mom! Dad! I'm scared.</p>
<p>I can't sleep.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Homie.</p>
<p>Bart's ten.</p>
<p>That could be the last tear that ever comes out of him.</p>
<p>He's sleeping here.</p>
<p>Take a hike, homeboy.</p>
<p>What the hey? </p>
<p>Just giving him his allowance.</p>
<p>This pamphlet on trauma they gave Bart is very alarming.</p>
<p>Loss of appetite? </p>
<p>Thousand-yard stare.</p>
<p>I'm not hungry.</p>
<p>Where are you looking? </p>
<p>A thousand yards away.</p>
<p>No school for you, young man.</p>
<p>I'll set up the couch as a bed.</p>
<p>Can I put Homer's pillows under my butt? </p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>You don't need pillows under your butt.</p>
<p>Your butt is pillows, genius.</p>
<p>The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show.</p>
<p>And now, Itchy and Scratchy perform their cutting-edge version of the &quot;Sabre Dance.&quot; </p>
<p>Mom, can I have a jelly bean sandwich for lunch? </p>
<p>Mm, how about a fruit salad? </p>
<p>Fruit? </p>
<p>What's the matter? That's what they served at camp.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Fine, jelly beans.</p>
<p>Marge, voulez vous rendezvous at the dog's bed? </p>
<p>I can't move.</p>
<p>His head's on my arm.</p>
<p>Can you give me a foot rub? </p>
<p>Also, we both have to sign this permission slip.</p>
<p>Uh, maybe we should just go to sleep.</p>
<p>Oof! Can't sleep, can't snuggle.</p>
<p>Gonna do the unthinkable.</p>
<p>Homie, what do you mean? </p>
<p>Gonna go to work early.</p>
<p>Geez, there's a lot of spaces when you get in early.</p>
<p>Geez, there's a lot of donuts when you get in early.</p>
<p>Hot coffee? </p>
<p>Whoever heard of such a thing? </p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>I was supposed to read this when I started the job, but I didn't want the other workers to think of me as a nerd.</p>
<p>What's he doing? </p>
<p>He's reading.</p>
<p>Nerd.</p>
<p>Hey, Homer, settle a bet.</p>
<p>Red beans and rice or red beans on rice? </p>
<p>Winner gets 3,000 bucks.</p>
<p>Sorry, guys, maybe another time.</p>
<p>Homer Simpson don't want to screw around.</p>
<p>That's like Aquaman moving to Phoenix.</p>
<p>You know, Lenny, seeing Homer acting responsible </p>
<p>Oh, Aquaman to Phoenix, I just got that Uh, makes me want to buckle down and do my job.</p>
<p>You know, vice president of marketing.</p>
<p>Hey, if you need me, I'll be cold-calling people to see what they think of electricity.</p>
<p>Uh, Mr. Smithers, I, uh, I noticed the plant's free subscription to Nuclear Safety magazine was hitting the six-month mark.</p>
<p>They're gonna start charging us the full newsstand price.</p>
<p>And no one pays those prices.</p>
<p>Nice catch, Simpson.</p>
<p>So I had the idea to cancel it and sign up for another free trial under a new e-mail.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Wow! </p>
<p>Simpson, something is very different about you.</p>
<p>I am sexually frustrated.</p>
<p>Tell me about it.</p>
<p>Kamp Krusty! Kamp Krusty! </p>
<p>Homie, listen.</p>
<p>No ketchup! No ketchup! </p>
<p>Oh, no, not the hamburger dream.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, I really am traumatized.</p>
<p>I need help.</p>
<p>Lis! Lis! Can it wait till morning? </p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Lis! Lis! </p>
<p>Thanks for waiting till morning.</p>
<p>No problemo.</p>
<p>I had an actual nightmare about Kamp Krusty.</p>
<p>There was a body in a red life vest! </p>
<p>What else do you remember? </p>
<p>We were canoeing.</p>
<p>We were in a storm.</p>
<p>It's coming back to me, too! </p>
<p>Whatever happened must have been so horrible we repressed the memory.</p>
<p>But don't tell, because they'll make me miss school.</p>
<p>Maybe you should miss school.</p>
<p>I have perfect attendance.</p>
<p>You can't get that back! </p>
<p>Okay, I'll bring your carriage around.</p>
<p>Uh-oh, looks like snow.</p>
<p>Very funny, Bart.</p>
<p>Stop it! Made you breakfast.</p>
<p>I also made reservations for Mother's Day.</p>
<p>I know it's three months away, but you can't book too early.</p>
<p>Wow! Who's that guy? </p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>D'oh! Mr.Burns, I noticed no one ever puts suggestions in the box.</p>
<p>So I took the liberty of making my own.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Simpson, I'm giving you a raise.</p>
<p>More money? But that's more than I make now! </p>
<p>You've done so well, Simpson.</p>
<p>I'm giving you your own trap door button.</p>
<p>Oh, thank you! </p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Coming through.</p>
<p>Working out issues.</p>
<p>Boom-shakalaka.</p>
<p>I was at Kamp Krusty, too.</p>
<p>You don't see me freaking out every time I see Red vest! Red vest! </p>
<p>What does it mean? </p>
<p>What does it mean? It means, young lady, that you're about to go to the head of the line.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>If everyone has a cut-the-line pass, no one has a cut-the-line pass.</p>
<p>Quit your whining! I'm riding the ride!</p>
<p>While you were pouting, I did it again! </p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Maggie's asleep, and the kids are still having fun at the park with Gram-pa.</p>
<p>We're alone.</p>
<p>Marge, no! </p>
<p>I've pledged my abstinence, like all the most successful rock stars.</p>
<p>Come on, mister.</p>
<p>I'm too tired to get my groove back.</p>
<p>It's all on you! No means no.</p>
<p>I looked it up in the dictionary.</p>
<p>No?! No?! You've never said &quot;no.&quot; </p>
<p>Hmm? Hmm.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Oh! Honey, I'm really sorry, but I'm here for you every way.</p>
<p>Except physically.</p>
<p>Also, spiritually and emotionally.</p>
<p>And I've never been good at zipping up dresses.</p>
<p>What are you saying? </p>
<p>Men have accomplished unbelievable things when they've denied themselves whoopee.</p>
<p>The pointy pyramids of Egypt, the Duomo, which I now know is a thing.</p>
<p>You don't name a company &quot;Microsoft&quot; when you're getting some.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>First the kids are screwed up, and now our marriage is? </p>
<p>We need therapy.</p>
<p>I said &quot;therapy,&quot; not &quot;theremin.&quot; </p>
<p>Honest mistake.</p>
<p>Or was it? </p>
<p>Welcome, Marge.</p>
<p>Homer, no need to take your pants off.</p>
<p>It's not what you think.</p>
<p>I just had a big lunch.</p>
<p>Just a series of questions for now.</p>
<p>Then the pants come off.</p>
<p>Now, let me be blunt.</p>
<p>Are you happy with your romantic life? </p>
<p>My problem used to be too much satisfaction.</p>
<p>We hear that a lot.</p>
<p>But I'm afraid not so much lately.</p>
<p>Do you self-gratify? </p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I do everything but masturbate.</p>
<p>You know, this all started with our poor kids traumatized by a budget summer camp.</p>
<p>So many perfect marriages ruined by kids.</p>
<p>We tell them it's not their fault, when, of course, it's always their fault.</p>
<p>What you must do is return your children to this camp and face down their demons.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait! </p>
<p>There's so much more you can do when you don't think about sex.</p>
<p>That's why nuns are so successful.</p>
<p>You have to take the kids back to that camp.</p>
<p>Well, it b*at hanging out with them.</p>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse us, we have some deviants coming in.</p>
<p>Hello? Anybody here? Yeah, I brought my lady.</p>
<p>She used to be the helicopter ride in front of the supermarket.</p>
<p>Oh, uh, just finished.</p>
<p>All right, deviant out.</p>
<p>My kids are a mess.</p>

<p>Homer's turned into the man I've always wanted, which I don't really want.</p>
<p>And for some reason, we're going back to Kamp Krusty.</p>
<p>Aw! What happened to this place? </p>
<p>People are wearing terrycloth bathrobes like they're ancient Romans.</p>
<p>Actually, more like Macedonians.</p>
<p>All right, come on, deer and pig.</p>
<p>It's time for you to mate and then fight to the death.</p>
<p>What happened to this place? </p>
<p>Oh, uh, Krusty cut his losses by partnering with Caligula's World Family Entertainment.</p>
<p>They redid the whole place as an adult spa.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Did I leave my sash on? </p>
<p>Why don't you kids go in here, and we'll find someone who can prove to you that what you think happened didn't happen.</p>
<p>So, what do we do now, get naked? </p>
<p>Ha-ha! I'm joking.</p>
<p>Unless you want to.</p>
<p>In which case, I've never been more serious.</p>
<p>So, um, uh, which is it? </p>
<p>Don't want to.</p>
<p>Ah, good thing I was joking.</p>
<p>Who stole the cookie from the cookie jar? </p>
<p>Tyler stole the cookie from the cookie jar </p>
<p>What, me? </p>
<p>Yeah, you Couldn't be Then who? </p>
<p>Courtney stole the cookie from the cookie jar </p>
<p>I've heard enough.</p>
<p>Let's go, Courtney.</p>
<p>You, too, Tyler.</p>
<p>Hey, Bart, Bart, now's our chance to break out of here.</p>
<p>But I'm four loops away from finishing my potholder.</p>
<p>Now! </p>
<p>Ugh! </p>
<p>Marge, you know, it used to be I'd be tempted by every one of these places.</p>
<p>Now I just want to know where the business center is.</p>
<p>It's over there.</p>
<p>You can print up all the free boarding passes you want.</p>
<p>Oh! We didn't even fly here.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Bart, I've seen that shed before! </p>
<p>Hey, I know your life is boring, but you don't have to advertise it.</p>
<p>I'm remembering now.</p>
<p>We were trying to escape by canoe.</p>
<p>Come back! </p>
<p>Everyone needs to watch the musical! </p>
<p>We've rehearsed for three hours! </p>
<p>But there was another kid with us.</p>
<p>You're right! </p>
<p>His name was Charlie.</p>
<p>I forgot because I was high on poster paint fumes.</p>
<p>Quiet! We tipped over in the rapids.</p>
<p>Oh, my God! </p>
<p>Charlie didn't come back up! </p>
<p>Hey, hey! </p>
<p>Look who's back! </p>
<p>Kamp Krusty alumni! </p>
<p>We have reason to believe that someone was k*ll in this camp! </p>
<p>Whoa! </p>
<p>What happened to hello? </p>
<p>Hard to concentrate with waves gently lapping on the shore.</p>
<p>Ooh! Marge, are you sure you want to do this? </p>
<p>Mm, I think I still want the old you.</p>
<p>Everyone, down below the belt! </p>
<p>Move, move, move! </p>
<p>Don't leave anything up here! </p>
<p>We will not be back! </p>
<p>Play something to put him in the mood! </p>
<p>Faster! </p>
<p>These children would like to report a traumatic incident on the property.</p>
<p>Poor Charlie.</p>
<p>Charlie? </p>
<p>Did he have a red vest? </p>
