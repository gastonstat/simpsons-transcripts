<p>And the drawing of me was so off-model.   </p>
<p>I wouldn't worry, sir.   </p>

<em>- Alleged</em> b*at. Mm.   </p>
<p>The poisonings.   </p>
<p>Ah, yes. We've had some alleged good times, haven't we, Smithers?   </p>
<p>But there is an undercurrent of contempt for me.   </p>
<p>No, there isn't.   </p>
<p>You said Burns is worse than h*tler.   </p>

<p>(WHISTLE BLOWS)   </p>
<p>Huh. Was that the work whistle?   </p>
<p>Eh, who cares.   </p>
<p>(SCOFFS) Everywhere, I'm surrounded by malcontents, termagants and Lennys.   </p>
<p>Well, we could show the workers some actual respect, uh, considering how many have died.   </p>
<p>Or I could go undercover and infiltrate the workers.   </p>
<p>I'm beginning to suspect these monitors have been tampered with.   </p>
<p>I've assembled a world-class team to create your undercover disguise.   </p>
<p>The face mask specialist from the<em> Mission: Impossible</em> movies.    </p>
<p>I made Ving Rhames look like Kristin Chenoweth.    </p>
<p>I don't know any of those words, but I'm impressed.    </p>

<p>Mmm. What animal is this egg from?    </p>
<p>Uh, I want to say horse?    </p>
<p>Oh. Could I be sick in this?    </p>
<p>Oh... (RETCHING)    </p>

<p>I was worried about you, sir.    </p>
<p>Worried? Eh.    </p>
<p>I just had the greatest night of my life.    </p>

- What?    </p>
<p>Oh, you should've seen it, Smithers.    </p>

<p>(SIGHS) Well, did you find anything out?    </p>
<p>Any scuttlebutt from the union?    </p>
<p>The only union that concerns me now is the union of men.    </p>

<p>I'm sorry. Definitely not cool.    </p>
<p>Oh, all right, all right.    </p>
<p>I just don't trust new people in this town.    </p>
<p>Like Lady Gaga?<br />
She came, she inspired Lisa and we never heard from her again.    </p>
<p>Who needs friends like that?    </p>
<p>So, fellows, what's on our social agenda tonight?    </p>
<p>More galivanting, I hope?    </p>
<p>Well, we really should do a little work.    </p>
<p>Yeah.<br />
I have a whole inbox of unsplit atoms    </p>
<p>I haven't gotten to yet.    </p>
<p>Fred, are these men bothering you?    </p>
<p>- Oh, back off, Smithers.<br />
- ALL: Whoa!    </p>
<p>I'll box your ears next time you speak to me with such insolence.    </p>
<p>Yes, sir.    </p>
<p>Oh, my god.    </p>
<p>You totally pwned him.    </p>
<p>Hmm. I suppose I did pwn him.    </p>
<p>I did.    </p>
<p>Ugh, that was quite the kerfuffle.    </p>
<p>I better go take a three-hour nap.    </p>
<p>No, no, wait. While Smithers is off drowning his sorrows in a<em> pamplemousse</em> perrier, Burns is unprotected.    </p>
<p>This is the perfect time for you to represent us and hit the old skinflint up for a decent benefits package.    </p>
<p>Me, talk to Burns?    </p>
<p>Oh, I wouldn't. I-I couldn't.    </p>
<p>He's got the sharpest mind in all    states.    </p>
<p>Hey, come on, please. For your friends.    </p>
<p>I won't let you down.    </p>
<p>(ROBOTIC): You down, you down, you down.    </p>
<p>I'll help you, friends.    </p>
<p>FRED VOICE: Don't you understand, Burns?    </p>
<p>Without the workers, this plant is nothing.    </p>
<p>If you give them respect, it comes back to you a hundredfold.    </p>
<p>(CHUCKLES) Respect the workers?    </p>
<p>What next?<br />
Put batteries in the smoke detectors?    </p>
<p>Have you no heart?    </p>
<p>I certainly do.    </p>
<p>I'm not flooding this room with mustard gas right now.    </p>
<p>I'll give you a chance to tell your buddies that you failed.    </p>
<p>But then they might not like me anymore.    </p>
<p>You're right. Friendship <em>is</em> something worth treasuring.    </p>
<p>Boy, he's really raking Burns over the coals.    </p>
<p>Yeah, I like how they're not interrupting each other.    </p>
<p>- So polite.<br />
- BURNS: Yes, spirits, yes.    </p>
<p>I'll give them everything they want.    </p>
<p>- (EXHALES) He said...<br />
- We heard everything.    </p>
<p>Clearly it was two people talking.    </p>
<p>We got to spread the good news.    </p>
<p>We love you, big guy. (GRUNTS)    </p>
<p>Mr. Burns, what have you done?    </p>
<p>There is no Mr. Burns.    </p>
<p>Only Fred.    </p>
<p>What are you saying?    </p>
<p>Montgomery Burns died when I put on this suit.    </p>
<p>And six other times this week.    </p>
<p>Thank god for the new liver and kidneys.    </p>
<p>Wait up, guys! Beers are on me!    </p>
<p>I might have two tonight.    </p>
<p>That's right: Two sips!    </p>

I've had enough. Simpson, come with me.    </p>

<p>That's right. Fred is Mr. Burns.    </p>

Isn't that a good thing?    </p>
<p>It means he's nice to us now.    </p>

<p>Morning yoga? Irish brides?    </p>
<p>Okay, maybe the yoga is going too far.    </p>
<p>It's all too far.    </p>

<p>- Simpson, if you care about your job, and the jobs of everyone in this plant, you'll end your friendship with Mr. Burns.    </p>
<p>- Permanently.<br />
- No problem.    </p>

<p>It goes back to caveman days.    </p>
<p>Ten guys k*ll the mammoth while the boss yelled at them.    </p>
<p>Then the boss got all the meat and they got all the toenails.    </p>
<p>Because that's the way life works.    </p>
<p>Next came the Renaissance, and the invention of the time clock, which meant the boss no longer had to waste time checking on his employees and could become Pope and marry his sister.    </p>
