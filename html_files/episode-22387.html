What Animated Women Want<br />
Original Air Date on April 14, 2013</p>
<p>What do women want?</p>
<p>Throughout their herstory...</p>
<p>That's right, I said herstory.</p>
<p>Of plant Earth, men have attempted to answer that question, and failed.</p>
<p>Or should I say, &quot;maled&quot;.</p>
<p>Ha, ha, ha...</p>
<p>Keep it under your head guys.</p>
<p>That I've got a date with a married woman.</p>
<p>So let me guess.</p>
<p>Is it Marge?</p>
<p>Her husband's gonna be there too.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>You and Marge.</p>
<p>Give up?</p>
<p>It's Marge.</p>
<p>I'm having a lunch date with my wife Good one.</p>
<p>Yeah. You got us man.</p>
<p>Ha, ha.</p>
<p>A date with my wife.</p>
<p>Yeah, well I got plans for lunch too.</p>
<p>I'm lying under a tree.</p>
<p>Hmm. Everybody's got something.</p>
<p>Ooh... this is the coolest sushi restaurant in town.</p>
<p>It got three and a half stars in the Springfield Tire Guide.</p>
<p>When we got married, I promised you a life full of romance.</p>
<p>Now here it is.</p>
<p>(Marge grumbles)</p>
<p>(Marge and Homer gasp)</p>
<p>Not fresh enough.</p>
<p>Can we get some soy sauce?</p>
<p>We do not recommend soy sauce with that particular roll.</p>
<p>No soy sauce!</p>
<p>You and all your ancestors... banned!</p>
<p>But-but I... but...</p>
<p><em>Edamame</em> them away!</p>
<p>You really think that's going to get rid of us?</p>
<p>How you like this soy sauce?</p>
<p>The customer is never right!</p>
<p>If they can be that rude, the food must be great.</p>
<p>I was just leaving a tip.</p>
<p>Tip included!</p>
<p>Oh, Marge, this is amazing!</p>
<p>I never realized some restaurants are better than others.</p>
<p>I hope you are enjoying your sushi.</p>
<p>It's as yummy as your poorly produced local commercial said.</p>
<p>I argued against that cowboy hat, but in the end, it worked.</p>
<p>So, without the kids, we can have sophisticated grown-up talk.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Mmm!</p>
<p>And I'm thinking of getting Maggie swimming lessons.</p>
<p>b*at drowning.</p>
<p>When God rested on the seventh day, did he take a nap or do a hobby he enjoyed?</p>
<p><em>I</em> think I'm interesting!</p>
<p>What?! What?!</p>
<p>You're interesting!</p>
<p>Why would you say that?!</p>
<p>Can you chew with your mouth closed?</p>
<p>It's like looking into a garbage disposal.</p>
<p>(swallows) Words hurt, you know?</p>
<p>(sobs)</p>
<p>(slurping)</p>
<p>(blows nose)</p>
<p>The most romantic part of this was the hold music when I made the reservation.</p>
<p>Maybe it's time for a visit from Wally the Kissing Walrus.</p>
<p>(smacking lips loudly)</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>Everything has its breaking point.</p>
<p>Even the strongest substance in the universe... a married mother of three.</em></p>
<p>That usually works, but not today.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Marge, I thought this was an innocuous lunch, but it's become terribly ocuous!</p>
<p>Uh, conversation, conversation...</p>
<p>You look great.</p>
<p>And, uh, how was your day?</p>
<p>Lousy.</p>
<p>You can't spell &quot;lousy&quot; without &quot;us.&quot;</p>
<p>I'm going to take a cab.</p>
<p>Marge, wait!</p>
<p>Listen, we swore we'd never go to sleep angry at each other.</p>
<p>I'm not going to sleep.</p>
<p>Well, you didn't have two beers with your lunch.</p>
<p>(yawns)</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>A marriage so perfect that I could take it for granted for years suddenly explodes.</p>
<p>What do I do? What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>For a man confronted with danger, two responses immediately come to mind.</em></p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: <em>I like that picture of the sneaker with the wings.</p>
<p>I'm gonna flee!</em></p>
<p>(panting)</p>
<p>Where's an electric sidewalk when you need one?</p>
<p>Fleeing didn't work.</p>
<p>I have no choice.</p>
<p>I will have to... do whatever the other thing was!</p>
<p><em>As Homer prepares to fight for his marriage, another battle between the sexes begins... on the other side of Springfield.</em></p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p><strong>Milhouse</strong>: <em>Just once, I wish Lisa would get up, come over and sit next to me.</p>
<p>She's getting up! She's coming over!</p>
<p>This is a nightmare!</em></p>
<p>I think our lunches got mixed up.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>That means I threw yours out.</p>
<p>But I still have a couple of your mini carrots.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>What's the matter?</p>
<p>Not a vegetarian?</p>
<p>Milhouse, got anything good?</p>
<p>Sure. I've got goulash, schnitzel, g*n...</p>
<p>Ooh, a cupcake.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah...</p>
<p>Um... do you want it?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><em>I'm gonna give up my cupcake for a second of attention?</p>
<p>Isn't there a better way to relate to a girl?</em></p>
<p>Go wash up and help me clear the table.</p>
<p>Now, that's how I clear the table!</p>
<p>He could board my streetcar any time.</p>
<p>(both laugh)</p>
<p>Why doesn't Blanche go for that delightful Karl Malden?</p>
<p><strong>Nelson</strong>: Who, Potato Nose? Forget it.</p>
<p>For some stupid reason, chicks dig Brando.</p>
<p>Sweaty clothes and mumbling? (sighs)</p>
<p>I've been wasting my time with this sophisticated act.</p>
<p>Lisa, you can't have my cupcake.</p>
<p>Wha...?</p>
<p>You heard me, Duchess.</p>
<p>It's mine, and I'm saving it.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>If you'll excuse me, I have to go think of you in a different light.</p>
<p>Great. She's never gonna talk to me again.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I was inconsiderate, Milhouse.</p>
<p>And furthermore, I respect you more for saying no.</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>Tell you what, babe.</p>
<p>Why don't you get me a milk? (scoffs)</p>
<p>Milhouse, where are you going with this?</p>
<p>Playing the biggest hunch of my life.</p>
<p>I just have one thing to say: chocolate or regular?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Why am I doing this?</p>
<p>(à la Marlon Brando): What are you doing, going to Wisconsin for the milk?</p>
<p>I've seen cafeteria ketchup move faster!</p>
<p>(sighs)</p>
<p>(both laugh)</p>
<p>Who knew having a backbone was attractive?</p>
<p>Certainly not I.</p>
<p>It would change the way my suits fit.</p>
<p>Milhouse, you'll probably think this is lame, but I was gonna go for a nature walk after school, and I thought maybe you'd like to...</p>
<p>Just start nature-walking.</p>
<p>See if I show up.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>Milhouse has made his choice, and if there's any justice, he's doomed.</p>
<p>Now let's see what Maggie's up to.</p>
<p>Moving on...</em></p>
<p>Why are all his laundry-basket shots three point attempts?</p>
<p>What are you doing home from work?</p>
<p>I'm fighting for you, babe.</p>
<p>Fighting like I would for the last slice of cold pizza in the box.</p>
<p>And to show you how serious I am...</p>
<p>From the gas station?</p>
<p>From the place <em>beside</em> the gas station.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Well, that does sound good.</p>
<p>I'll just stick this in your apology card drawer.</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>No. I'm tired of your broken promises.</p>
<p>&quot;Marge, I'm gonna lose ten pounds.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sweetie, I'll be home at 8:00 p.m.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sweetie, I'll be home at 8:00 a.m.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll take you out to the most romantic lunch of your life.&quot; I'm done!</p>
<p>Marge was so happy when I made those promises.</p>
<p>What changed?</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>Milhouse, seeing you there saying nothing... it's the cutest you've ever been.</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>Hush, sweet boy.</p>
<p>Let me get lost in the blue of your eyebrows.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>Did you bring me that sandwich what I sent you out for?</p>
<p>It came with fries or salad.</p>
<p>Whichever you picked, you picked wrong.</p>
<p>Well, I wasn't sure, so I got both.</p>
<p>(chuckles) Who knows her little Milhouse?</p>
<p><em>I'm acting like a jerk, and Lisa's eating it up.</p>
<p>Why don't I feel good?</p>
<p>I need advice from the most important woman in my life.</em></p>
<p>So everything was going great, and then I wondered if the me she likes is the real me.</p>
<p>Well, let me say this is the first time you've been brave enough to sit in this office without a bunny in your lap.</p>
<p>Where is the bunny?!</p>
<p>He's in the closet.</p>
<p>He's fine.</p>
<p>I'm over here, Milhouse. Focus.</p>
<p>You got to help me, Doc.</p>
<p>I just don't know what to do.</p>
<p>Don't worry, I'm here for you, and I'll be here for as long as it takes.</p>

<p><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div></p>
<p>(phone rings)</p>
<p>I'm fired?</p>
<p>You're on your own.</p>
<p>I'll clean out my office immediately.</p>
<p>I'll show you how to clean out an office!</p>
<p>I don't usually say this to kids, but don't be yourself.</p>
<p>Because yourself is not working.</p>
<p>Be that guy you just were.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>Oh, I love you, Fluffy Fella.</p>
<p>I just got fired!</p>
<p>I need it more than you.</p>
<p>Fluffy Fella!</p>
<p>Fella...!</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>Meanwhile, Homer was doing something very difficult for him-- thinking.</em></p>
<p>How do I win Marge over?</p>
<p>I could get her kids to like me.</p>
<p>No, that ship has sailed.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>Fortunately, the modern man has a third alternative.</em></p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Would it make a woman happy to do the things she asked you to do?</p>
<p>I think it would.</p>
<p>Searchy, where can I find brake fluid?</p>
<p>There are 14 Taco Joes in your area.</p>
<p>That was yesterday.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday&quot; by John Lennon and Paul McCartney.</p>
<p>Where can I find a better voice-activated search machine?</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>Oh, I can't please any woman.</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>(Bart and Milhouse giggling)</p>
<p>Milhouse, I'm not sure why you left me in the forest, so I made cookies.</p>
<p>But I didn't know what kind you liked, so I made seven kinds.</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>I've become my mother.</p>
<p>Well, common sense never goes out of style. (groans)</p>
<p>(shrieks) That was too easy.</p>
<p>Lisa!</p>
<p>Did you see Marlon Brando in &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;?</p>
<p>No, nobody did.</p>
<p>Then this is just me.</p>
<p>(yells)</p>
<p>Ta-da.</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>(grunts)</p>
<p>Bart! Milhouse!</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>(chuckling)</p>
<p>Okay, let's see how straight it is.</p>
<p>(grunts)</p>
<p>Guess who's coming to dinner.</p>
<p>What have I told you about comical entrances?</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>But you never said anything about comical exits.</p>
<p>Homie, what are you doing?</p>
<p>I'm planing down that door that always sticks.</p>
<p>I put training wheels on Bart's bike, and made an appointment with the dermatologist to see about my slowly receding hairline.</p>
<p>Oh, Homer.</p>
<p>Yes, my love?</p>
<p>This list is from six years ago.</p>
<p>Oh, well, you know how, in the Special Olympics, they give medals just for showing up?</p>
<p>How many times do I have to tell you to quit comparing our relationship to the Special Olympics?</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>When all is lost, a man's mind turns to one thing and one thing only.</em></p>
<p>What fish may I deplete from our oceans for your passing pleasure?</p>
<p>Perhaps some shark fin soup?</p>
<p>Whale tonsils?</p>
<p>Baby dolphin blowhole?</p>
<p>Turtle smile?</p>
<p>I'd like a lot of food, and for this to be the last decision I have to make.</p>
<p>Aye, you want <em>omakase--</em> chef's choice.</p>
<p>You're all I have left.</p>
<p>I trust you completely.</p>
<p>And I you.</p>
<p>Let me run your credit card to celebrate that trust.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This should do it.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Franders.</p>
<p>(grunts)</p>
<p>Lis, you saved us.</p>
<p>Milhouse, are you okay?</p>
<p>Milhouse, for <em>Superman II,</em></p>
<p>I got $5 million for three days work, so don't expect any more free advice from me.</p>
<p>How about me, Potato Nose?</p>
<p>Uh... later.</p>
<p>(sighs)</p>
<p>I see tears in your <em>toro.</em></p>
<p>Marriage is so tough.</p>
<p>Every second, it could explode catastrophically.</p>
<p>Makes me not want to come home from my job at the nuclear plant.</p>
<p>I say marriage is like fish.</p>
<p>There are parts so delicious they could've been sliced from angels... and parts we make into <em>omakase.</p>
<p>Omakase...</em></p>
<p>Where have I heard that word before?</p>
<p>You haven't-- now, finish your <em>omakase.</em></p>
<p>Although we have but one ocean, it offers many special delights.</p>
<p>(screams)</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Wow, this is the most delicious analogy I've ever eaten.</p>
<p>I need to share this insight with Marge.</p>
<p>Put this in your finest Styrofoam.</p>
<p>(clamoring)</p>
<p>Once again, by eating alone, I have saved my marriage.</p>
<p>Please enjoy, with my compliments.</p>
<p>You can even eat the eyes.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>He ate the eye. (laughs)</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Marge?</p>
<p>For reasons I forgot in the car, this sushi represents our marriage.</p>
<p>But what I know for sure is that I want to share it with you.</p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: <em>He's taken a step.</p>
<p>He's really close.</p>
<p>All he has to do is not eat a piece before I do.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But every man deserves a second chance.</p>
<p>As long as he doesn't...</em></p>
<p>I'm not hungry.</p>
<p>Good night.</p>
<p>Well, at least you don't have to suffer, boy.</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>Someone fed my sushi to a dog!</p>
<p>You didn't get so mad when I told you I was fired today.</p>
<p>Blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>Now you can get your PhD.</p>
<p>I don't want a PhD.</p>
<p>I want a baby.</p>
<p>(groans) Here we go again.</p>
<p>Lisa, I could be anyone for you.</p>
<p>Except someone who's mean to you.</p>
<p>So I'm just gonna cave in and give you the cupcake.</p>
<p>I don't know... it's four days old, I just ate...</p>
<p>Who are you, the Queen of Siam?</p>
<p>Just take the cupcake.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I wonder if Brando liked cupcakes.</p>
<p>I'm down to two a day, but I've been dead for ten years.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: <em>Aw, Moe.</em></p>
<p>Can you think of a way to please a woman that starts with &quot;F&quot;?</p>
<p>Hey, you know, it's funny you should mention that.</p>
<p>I've been reading that, uh, <em>Fifty Shades of Grey,</em> and it turns out that what chicks want now is a guy to give them what for in the bedroom there.</p>
<p>Whoo-hoo! I'll woo her with whoo-hoo.</p>
<p>Ah, you know, if this is what women like, I should be a lot more popular.</p>
<p>But it does inspire me to work on my fan fiction.</p>
<p>&quot;Sheriff Andy took Barney in his arms and kissed him deeply, then said, 'Now, if Aunt Bee asks, we were down at the fishin' hole.'&quot;</p>
<p>I-I can't be the only one who likes this.</p>
<p>Hello, there.</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>The minister's wife-- what are you doing here?</p>
<p>Um... protesting.</p>
<p>Is this dominating enough for you, sweetheart?</p>
<p>Go back to the cowboy thing and wait in the car.</p>
<p>Help me out here, Homer.</p>
<p>(nervous laugh)</p>
<p>Listenpal, this may sound kind of kinky, but, uh, I would like to, uh, please my wife.</p>
<p>Well, are you comfortable with role play?</p>
<p>(Cockney accent): I think I could give it a sh*t what-what, governor.</p>
<p>Bob's your uncle.</p>
<p>Okay, no role play.</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p><strong>Homer (singsongy)</strong>: Oh, Marge.</p>
<p>Come to the garage.</p>
<p>You know it'll be good 'cause I'm saying it in a singsong fashion.</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>It's a snuggle dungeon.</p>
<p>Hey, Homer, can I get back my...</p>
<p>(screams)</p>
<p>What does this do?</p>
<p>Now, just relax.</p>
<p>Sit down...</p>
<p>Not in that chair!</p>
<p>It has no bottom!</p>
<p>This is not putting me in the mood.</p>
<p>Anger's a mood.</p>
<p>Why would you think I'd like this?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>It's just that you always say we should try new things.</p>
<p>But I thought snuggle clamps just might rekindle...</p>
<p>(screaming)</p>
<p>Quick, call the Procter &amp; Gamble help line!</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Geez, they make everything.</p>
<p>(pained sigh)</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: <em>Oh, my God, Marge is here.</p>
<p>What is she thinking now?</em></p>
<p>I'm glad you're okay.</p>
<p>Mmm?</p>
<p>Now, I'm going to give you a powerful muscle relaxant.</p>
<p>Hmm, that was just a placebo.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Powerful drug.</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>Homer, I'm glad that you tried, even though now I can't find the washing machine.</p>
<p>It's behind the Dingle Swing.</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>So you forgive me?</p>
<p>Not because of what you bought, but because I realized that no matter what, you will never stop trying, and there's nothing a woman loves more than that.</p>
<p>Aw, thanks, honey.</p>
<p>So, uh, you're not cool with any of the toys?</p>
<p>Actually, I'm cool with one of them.</p>
<p>Which one?</p>
<p>Not gonna say.</p>
<p>What size batteries?</p>
<p>D.</p>
<p>Ooh, how many?</p>
<p>Sixteen.</p>
<p>Holy moly.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>And so Homer and Marge's marriage was saved for another week.</p>
<p>As for Milhouse and Lisa...</em></p>
<p>Aw, that's sweet.</p>
<p>And those are the only two that reached the window.</p>
<p>♪ What do you get when you fall in love? ♪<br />
♪ A guy with a pin to burst your bubble ♪<br />
♪ That's what you get for all of your trouble... ♪</p>
<p>Are we forever to be trapped here in this sea?</p>
<p>(yawns)</p>
<p>Look, a light!</p>
<p>Perhaps that is the way forward.</p>
<p>(stomach growls)</p>
<p>(whimpers)</p>
<p>Our journey begins.</p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: <em>On the next new</em> Simpsons, <em>Springfield fights off a bedbug invasion.</p>
<p>In two weeks, on Fox.</em></p>
<p>Shh!</p>
