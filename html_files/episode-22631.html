Original Air Date on September 27, 2015</p>
<p>(alarm sounding, birds squawking)</p>
<p>(alarm continues)</p>
<p>(soft groaning, snoring)</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Where's the snooze button?</p>
<p>Ah, that's better.</p>
<p>Hey, what?</p>
<p>I gotta get out of here!</p>
<p>(alarm blaring)</p>
<p>It's... (yawns)</p>
<p>After just five more minutes.</p>
<p>(yawns)</p>
<p>(alarm blaring)</p>
<p>(laughing): Oh... Marge...</p>
<p>On a Tuesday?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hibbert</strong>: <em>Yet again,</em> Homer will be fine.</p>
<p>Mm. He's been sleeping an awful lot. Look at these vacation photos.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hibbert</strong>: Oh, my! (chuckling) Man, you people sure take a lot of vacations.</p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: That's just to remind me where I parked.</p>
<p>Hmm. I think I have an idea of what might be going on.</p>
<p>(gasps) Huh? What?</p>
<p>First, you're gonna need a spinal tap.</p>
<p>Please be the band. Please be the band.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Aren't you supposed to give him anesthetic?</p>
<p>Oh, I knew I forgot something.</p>
<p>(screaming): Ow!</p>
<p>(printer whirring)</p>
<p>Oof. Very low levels of hypocretin.</p>
<p>I'm afraid Homer has... narcolepsy.</p>
<p>Doctor, is it time to pull the plug on my father?</p>
<p>No, wait. I'll spare you that painful decision.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: No, Bart! That's the TV!</p>
<p>Ha-ha! That's the other guy.</p>
<p>Stop that!</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>Narcolepsy's merely sleeping sickness, and many narcoleptics do lead normal lives by avoiding stressful triggers like, uh, oh, let's say...</p>
<p>Helping with the laundry?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Having to pay my doctor's bill?</p>
<p>Don't play with me, man.</p>
<p>I will mess you up.</p>
<p>Here's a signed certification of your condition.</p>
<p>This is a bona fide medical excuse from doing anything you find taxing.</p>
<p>But you only use that when absolutely necessary, right, Homie?</p>
<p>Marge, please!</p>
<p>I'll probably<em> never</em> use it.</p>
<p>Dad, can you drive me to Milhouse's?</p>
<p>Narcolepsy.</p>
<p>There's a spider in my room!</p>
<p>Narcolepsy.</p>
<p>Dr. Hibbert called in a prescription for you to pick up.</p>
<p>Narcolepsy.</p>
<p>Yes,<em> for</em> narcolepsy, which you should get now.</p>
<p>You can't spend half your life napping.</p>
<p>Maggie does, and you think she's adorable.</p>
<p>Yes, because babies are always cute.</p>
<p>(snoring)</p>
<p>(coughing)</p>
<p>(sniffs) Oh, that baby needs a diaper change.</p>
<p>Nar-co-lep-sy.</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>Homie, you have no idea what it's like being married to you.</p>
<p>Me being married to me, eh?</p>
<p>(&quot;Bridal Chorus&quot; playing)</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Stop the wedding!</p>
<p>What about our child?</p>
<p>(baby whimpers)</p>
<p>(dog barks)</p>
<p>Don't forget me.</p>
<p>Now I've seen everything.</p>
<p>A window that talks?!</p>
<p>Okay, can you explain again how I take this medication?</p>
<p>One a day with food.</p>
<p>Yeah, but what kind of food, girly?</p>
<p>Stuffed cabbage, a nice bowl of soup?</p>
<p>(sighs) Any idea when you'll get to me?</p>
<p>Well, there's four old people ahead of you, so how's Thursday at 1:00?</p>
<p>Oh, you know it's funny that you should say one, 'cause that's how many grandchildren that I have.</p>
<p>I'm gonna have grandchildren by the time I get through this line.</p>
<p>Oh, that's so nice.</p>
<p>Isn't that interesting?</p>
<p>Oh, well, congratulations.</p>
<p>(giggles)</p>
<p>Narcolepsy, take me away!</p>
<p>Oh! (grunts)</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>(toy squeaks)</p>
<p>(sniffing)</p>
<p>I smell beer.</p>
<p>Did you go to Moe's?</p>
<p>Every time I have beer on my breath, you assume I've been drinking.</p>
<p>(groans loudly)</p>
<p>Oh, that's a long one.</p>
<p>Did you at least get the medicine?</p>
<p>I tried, and I failed.</p>
<p>Miserably.</p>
<p>But I'm willing to work this out in counseling.</p>
<p>(groans) We've been to every counselor from Avery to Zabinsky.</p>
<p>But not Zilowitz.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>:<em> And that's why there'll never be</em> another golfer as good as Chi-Chi Rodríguez.</p>
<p>The name and the game, he had it all.</p>
<p>Okay, I think we got a little off-track here.</p>
<p>I know this marriage isn't perfect, or even great, but now I treasure the moments where it's just so-so.</p>
<p>(snoring)</p>
<p>I'd k*ll for &quot;okay.&quot;</p>
<p>Please, please, just tell me what to do.</p>
<p>I've never said this-- and I don't even know if I'm supposed to say this-- but this marriage is rotting with the stench of death.</p>
<p>Oh, that seems a little strong.</p>
<p>How about reeking like a trashcan in a dog park?</p>
<p>Does my marriage have to be something you can smell?</p>
<p>(snoring)</p>
<p>You see, Marge? You see?</p>
<p>The only way you and Homer will ever be happy is to spend a little time apart, followed by more time apart, followed by a divorce.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>What is... What, what's going on?</p>
<p>Wait, no, no, no, I remember.</p>
<p>Happy anniversary.</p>
<p>Homer, Homer, listen to me.</p>
<p>There's just so much I can take.</p>
<p>No, we can save this.</p>
<p>We'll go to a therapist.</p>
<p>We're<em> at</em> a therapist!</p>
<p>How you doin'?</p>
<p>What's going on here?</p>
<p>(sobbing)</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Everything's fine.</p>
<p>See? (sobbing continues)</p>
<p>I'll love you forever.</p>
<p>Kids, a professional felt the best way for your father and me to work on our relationship was to give up on it.</p>
<p>But after a while, Dad's coming back?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Maybe not.</p>
<p>Oh, Marge, after all my divorce-worthy statements and actions, many of which you don't know about, how can you kick me out now that I'm sick?</p>
<p>Narcolepsy is a serious thing.</p>
<p>Maybe because you didn't take it seriously enough.</p>
<p>I pity you!</p>
<p>(Homer sobbing)</p>
<p>(Homer wailing)</p>
<p>(crying): Why is Daddy going away? Is it my fault? (crying stops) Just kidding.</p>
<p>I have been waiting for this.</p>
<p>All my problems are my parents' fault!</p>
<p>Mr. Flanders, can I cry on your shoulder?</p>
<p>Boys, get my tear dickey.</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>: Yay!</p>
<p>(snoring)</p>
<p>(alarm beeping)</p>
<p>Five more minutes.</p>

<p>You and your wife may be calling it quits.</p>
<p>How can you be happy?</p>
<p>Oh, you guys missed a very sad montage, but then I remembered that after every fight we ever had, Marge takes me back.</p>
<p>I wouldn't be so cocky, Homer.</p>
<p>Marge has changed her relationship status to &quot;It's complicated.&quot;</p>
<p>(whistles) Not good.</p>
<p>Complicated? What's complicated?</p>
<p>We're not together, but we're not legally apart, and I have to fight for the right to see the children I spent my life avoiding.</p>
<p>What's complicated about that?</p>
<p>Simpson, where are your shoes?</p>

<p>Oh, sorry, sorry.</p>

<p>Yeah, it's great.</p>
<p>Except her friends are always over.</p>
<p>I've been there for three weeks, and I can't find the TV.</p>
<p>And no one has any problems, except they talk about them endlessly.</p>
<p>Kind of like you're doing now?</p>
<p>And the weirdest thing of all is now she wants me to meet her dad.</p>
<p>Wow, who pays for that dinner?</p>
<p>I plan to pretend there's a bug in my food and get the meal for free.</p>
<p>Smooth.</p>
<p>H-Hello, sir.</p>
<p>Thank you for inviting me to dinner, sir.</p>
<p>Homer, relax.</p>
<p>I have no problem with the age difference between you and my daughter.</p>
<p>In fact, I've been dating a much younger woman myself.</p>
<p>Oh, here she comes now.</p>
<p>(humming happily)</p>
<p>(gasping)</p>
<p>Okay, okay, we can be adults about this.</p>
<p>Waiter, champagne?</p>
<p>(sputtering)</p>
<p>So I can't date an older man, but your girlfriend can?</p>
<p>She's not my girlfriend.</p>
<p>Candice and I don't use labels.</p>
<p>Mm, doesn't look like she uses that much shampoo, either.</p>
<p>Lay off my girlfriend!</p>
<p>Roger is great with the kids.</p>
<p>He even taught Bart how to bunt.</p>
<p>Oh, so now you're super dad?</p>
<p>When I was a kid, you were never around.</p>
<p>You missed my high school play.</p>
<p>You told me not to come.</p>
<p>You're supposed to fight me on that!</p>
<p>Well, Marge, your Roger's not so perfect now.</p>
<p>He's got a screwed up daughter with a pathetic boyfriend.</p>
<p>Candice, dear, I apologize.</p>
<p>I'm trying so hard to set my life right.</p>
<p>Oh, speaking of which.</p>
<p>Marge, I am going to do something I should've done three weeks ago when I met you.</p>
<p>Will you marry me, Marge?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>As soon as my divorce is final.</p>
<p>Then you can put a ring on my finger, Homer.</p>
<p>I'm already pregnant.</p>
<p>You're pregnant?!</p>
<p>But I kept my shirt on!</p>
<p>(echoing): No!</p>
<p>(snoring)</p>
<p>Huh? What am I doing here?</p>
<p>Sleeping through our therapy session.</p>
<p>Dreaming only about you.</p>
<p>So none of it happened?</p>
<p>We're still together?</p>
<p>Somehow.</p>
<p>Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p>And you thought our only option was to break up.</p>
<p>I never said that.</p>
<p>If I told people that didn't belong together they shouldn't be together, I'd be out of a job.</p>
<p>Huh, I must have dreamed that, too.</p>
<p>Okay, why don't you tell us more about this dream?</p>
<p>All you need to know about my dream is that Marge and I have been completely turned around by it, and like Scrooge, I will demonstrate I have learned my lesson by making a boy run to the store and buy me a goose.</p>
<p>I think you're going to have to do a little more, Homer.</p>
<p>Oh, I'll do a lot more than a little more!</p>
<p>I'll do some.</p>
<p>If you could just be good for a month, that would really show me something.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Can the month be February?</p>
<p>Okay, March.</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>You did it, Homie!</p>
<p>And what a March it was.</p>
<p>A beautiful Easter, a sober St. Patrick's Day, and impeccable behavior watching the NCAA basketball tournament.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm!</p>
<p>And with your love, Dad, I'm eating meat and Maggie's talking.</p>
<p>♪ I see trees of green ♪<br />
♪ Red roses, too... ♪</p>
<p>What the...?</p>
<p><strong>Male singer (rock b*at)</strong>: ♪ I see them bloom ♪<br />
♪ For me and you ♪<br />
♪ And I say to my... ♪</p>
<p>Aah! Huh? Huh? Huh?</p>
<p>I got you one of those beers you enjoy unironically.</p>
<p>This won a blue ribbon in 1890?</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Wait, so this is reality?</p>
<p>That other dream was just a dream?</p>
<p>Noooooooo!</p>
<p>But you forgot to pay!</p>
<p>(distant): Oh!</p>
<p>(whimpering)</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>(sobbing)</p>
<p>I've lost everything.</p>
<p>My wife, my family...</p>
<p>(sobbing)</p>
<p>You didn't lose me, Dad.</p>
<p>(chuckles) Lisa?</p>
<p>You can never lose me.</p>
<p>We share the same bl*od, the same mixed feelings towards Bart, and you know I'll need support in my teenage w*r with Mom.</p>
<p>(sobbing, laughing): Oh, Lisa...</p>
<p>(both laughing)</p>
<p>Oh, Dad.</p>
<p>Dad!</p>
<p>Aw, sweetie...</p>
<p>Nothing could ever come between us.</p>
<p>...we'll be together forever.</p>
<p><strong>Roger</strong>: Lisa, where are you, dear?</p>
<p>I thought we'd get in a game of chess before we go pony shopping.</p>
<p>Gotta go.</p>
<p>Lisa!</p>
<p>I'll Skype you at Christmas!</p>
<p>(echoing): Noooo!</p>
<p>(Homer snoring)</p>
<p>Huh, so it was all <em>my</em> dream.</p>
<p>I better find out what this all means.</p>
<p>It means, like all married women, sometimes you're sick of your husband, but sometimes you're afraid of losing him.</p>
<p>And like all married men, I didn't hear that first thing, and I'm overconfident of the second.</p>
<p>So what do we do?</p>
<p>I need some kind of guidance to take away from all of this.</p>
<p>Put your finger on it so I can tie it in a bow.</p>
<p>Please?</p>
<p>Well, one thing we therapists can give is concise, simple solutions, and yours is...</p>
<p>Hannah, what does that one mean?</p>
<p>It means don't get drunk in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>♪ I see babies cry ♪<br />
♪ I watch them grow ♪<br />
♪ They'll learn much more ♪<br />
