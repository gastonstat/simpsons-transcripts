<p>Three Gays of the Condo.</p>
<p>D'oh! Ah!</p>
<p>[SIZZLING]</p>
<p>[HOMER HUMS]</p>
<p>I wonder what Mom came up with for this week's Family Wednesday.</p>
<p>I hope it's as fun as Pictionary was last week.</p>
<p>We weren't playing Pictionary. That was an intervention to stop your drinking.</p>
<p>What? Are you sure?</p>
<p>Aw, ha, ha.</p>
<p>Oh, that takes me back.</p>
<p>Here it is. This week's family activity.</p>
<p>Oh, a jigsaw puzzle.</p>
<p>&quot;Concert in Golden Gate Park. Ages 8 to 80.&quot;</p>
<p>We know when we're not wanted.</p>
<p>Hmph.</p>
<p>[DOOR SLAMS]</p>
<p>The box says it's a perfect way to spend the day.</p>
<p>And why would a box lie to a person?</p>
<p>The first step is the funnest, turning all the pieces face up.</p>
<p>Go crazy, dorks. I got better things to do.</p>
<p>Hey, Bart, I fixed my rock tumbler.</p>
<p>What do you say we turn this baby loose on some feldspar?</p>
<p>I'm in.</p>
<p>Oh, I hate this.</p>
<p>It's making me use my arms.</p>
<p>Hey, these two pieces are already connected. We're halfway there.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Hmm...</p>
<p>Does anyone have any swan heads? I've got nothing but necks.</p>
<p>Can't help you. All I got is gray.</p>
<p>Anybody working on a cement wall?</p>
<p>Turn it over, Homer.</p>
<p>Oh, right, ha, ha. Chinese guy. Chinese guy. Frisbee dog.</p>
<p>Ooh, look how late it is. Let's get you kids some coffee.</p>
<p>Homer, no scissors.</p>
<p>It's how the pros do it.</p>
<p>Sky, sky, sky with building... grass, grass with foot...</p>
<p>[LAUGHS]</p>
<p>Bart's so poor, he has to eat cardboard.</p>
<p>What are you eating?</p>
<p>Drywall.</p>
<p>Hey, kids. Uh, we're worried about your dad. He ain't been to work for a week.</p>
<p>What's he doing now? Is he a rodeo clown?</p>
<p>Is he Poochie again?</p>
<p>He's working on a jigsaw puzzle.</p>
<p>Oh, I guess he's done with all the fun stuff.</p>
<p>Now let's see.</p>
<p>This is either an old coconut or Tom Hayden.</p>
<p>Gee, Homer, that's super.</p>
<p>But, uh, have you thought about coming back to work?</p>
<p>[YELLS]</p>
<p>Hey, Homer, what's with the deranged look?</p>
<p>[BOTH GRUNTING]</p>
<p>Ow! My eye. I'm not supposed to get jigs in it.</p>
<p>I can't believe our family finished a project this complicated.</p>
<p>It's the only worthwhile thing I ever made that wasn't Lisa.</p>
<p>Prove me wrong, Silent Bob.</p>
<p>Ooh, that's quite a thingamajigsaw, but it looks like you're missing a piece.</p>
<p>Looks like you're missing a wife.</p>
<p>Ha, ha, I walked right into that one.</p>
<p>He's right, Dad. We're missing that singer's head.</p>
<p>[ALL GASP]</p>
<p>This is awful. It's like listening to Schubert's &quot;Unfinished Symphony.&quot;</p>
<p>Or when I messed up taping <em>City Slickers ll </em>and cut off the end.</p>
<p>Was Curly's gold just a legend?</p>
<p>Or like when...</p>
<p>I got nothing. Uh, let's just find that piece.</p>
<p>Hey, remember that pet gerbil we used to have? He didn't run away after all.</p>
<p>Puzzle piece, come out and play.</p>
<p>Hey, what's this?</p>
<p>&quot;Marge's Memory Chest&quot;?</p>
<p>Aw, Marge saved all this stuff from when we were going out.</p>
<p>Fake business card I made to impress her.</p>
<p>T-shirt from our first rock concert.</p>
<p>[HOMER CHUCKLES]</p>
<p>&quot;Meaux's Tavern grand opening.&quot;</p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]</p>
<p>That was back when his floors were sticky with promise.</p>
<p>[BELCHES]</p>
<p>Welcome to Meaux's. Home of the finest bar crystal in Springfield.</p>
<p>[BREAKING]</p>
<p>Shouldn't have cheaped out on the shelf.</p>
<p>I can't believe how young we looked in my memory.</p>
<p>Hey, there's writing on the back of this.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear Homer... I can't believe you're making this the worst night of my life&quot;?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>[THINKING] <em>You leave me sitting here all alone... while you play video games with your Neanderthal friends.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Marge, come here.</p>
<p>I need both hands for this game. Can you feed me nachos while I play?</p>
<p>Why don't you just stop playing?</p>
<p>Tell that to the brave crew of the <em>S.S. Triangle.</em></p>
<p>It's the evil rocks.</p>
<p>Take that.</p>
<p>Homer, I really don't wanna feed you.</p>
<p>Come on. You're always saying we should do things as a couple.</p>
<p>[MARGE GRUMBLES]</p>
<p>Oh, this is wonderful.</p>
<p>I love you... Atari.</p>
<p>Video games and too much beer.</p>
<p>You sure know how to show a girl a good time.</p>
<p>Well, I aims to please.</p>
<p>Hey, let's stop by that Dumpster and make out, ha, ha.</p>
<p>[GULPS]</p>
<p>Hold that thought.</p>
<p>[VOMITS]</p>
<p>[HOMER MOANING AND GRUNTING]</p>
<p>Young man, you've ingested a dangerous amount of alcohol.</p>
<p>The only dangerous amount is none.</p>
<p>[GRUNTS]</p>
<p>Let's go to the IHOP. I'm driving.</p>
<p><strong>Medic 1</strong>: All right, come on. Hey! Ow!</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Okay, Burger King. Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>Medic 2</strong>: Get his leg.</p>
<p>[THINKING] <em>Tonight, I learned the two of us can't work.</p>
<p>I don't want a life of watching you get drunk... then holding back your long, beautiful hair while you vomit.</p>
<p>I have my own dreams.</p>
<p>And I can't live them with you.</em></p>
<p>Why did she stay with me if she hated me so much?</p>
<p>Hey, two days later, she had a doctor's appointment.</p>
<p>&quot;Nausea, cravings, knocked up feeling.&quot;</p>
<p>She was pregnant with Bart.</p>
<p>And that's the reason she stayed with me.</p>
<p>I found the missing puzzle piece. It was under Maggie's eyelid.</p>
<p>How about that?</p>
<p>It's James Taylor.</p>
<p>Oh, the popular singer/songwriter/puzzle piece.</p>
<p>James Taylor.</p>
<p>Homie, remember that song we used to sing?</p>
<p><em>Mockingbird</em></p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. Whatever.</p>
<p>Homie, what's wrong?</p>
<p>Marge, did I ruin your life?</p>
<p>Oh, is this about that billboard my sisters put up?</p>
<p>No. The voters will decide that in November.</p>
<p>I was talking about this.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Oh, my God. I forgot all about this.</p>
<p>Where did you find it?</p>
<p>More like where didn't I find it?</p>
<p>It was practically everywhere.</p>
<p>Homer, I'm sorry you saw that, but I was very upset that night.</p>
<p>Quit changing the subject. How do you feel about me right now?</p>
<p>Well, I love you, of course.</p>
<p>But a lot of things you do still drive me crazy.</p>
<p>So you mean our whole marriage you've been resenting me behind my back?</p>
<p>A little bit, yeah.</p>
<p>Fine. I'll go sleep with someone who does appreciate me.</p>
<p>[CRYING]</p>
<p>[GROANS]</p>
<p>Time to repress another memory.</p>
<p>I am at Disneyland.</p>
<p>Disneyland.</p>
<p>You made your own breakfast?</p>
<p>Looks like you had a problem with those scrambled eggs.</p>
<p>It was a muffin.</p>
<p>I'll fix you something.</p>
<p>Oh, I get it. Your stupid husband is too &quot;drunk&quot; to do it right.</p>
<p>Well, there are a lot of beer cans around here.</p>
<p>[CANS CLANKING]</p>
<p>Oh, so you don't like it. What other secrets have you been hoarding to use?</p>
<p>Homer, let it go. It's not always gonna be perfect.</p>
<p>We've been married for 10 years.</p>
<p>Oh, I didn't realize you've been counting the years.</p>
<p>Is it that horrible living with me?</p>
<p>This morning isn't a barrel of laughs.</p>
<p>It is to me. Marge, I can't live like this. I'm tired of walking around on eggshells.</p>
<p>Maybe if you didn't throw them on the floor.</p>
<p>[CRACKING]</p>
<p>Now you're just making up rules.</p>
<p>Who made you Judge Judy and executioner?</p>
<p>Dad, where are you going?</p>
<p>Kids, sometimes when a daddy learns that a mommy always hated him... he needs some time away to think.</p>
<p>You're not gonna get divorced like Milhouse's parents, are you?</p>
<p>Ha, ha. Oh, no, no. This is nothing like Milhouse's parents.</p>
<p>Now, if you need me, I'll be staying with Milhouse's father.</p>
<p>[g*n]</p>
<p>Uh, welcome to my place. I just have a few rules.</p>
<p>If you see a necktie on the doorknob, I'm with a lady.</p>
<p>You don't have a doorknob.</p>
<p>I don't have a tie either.</p>
<p>Just go label your food.</p>
<p>[KIRK CRYING]</p>
<p><strong>Kirk</strong>: Oh, Luann.</p>
<p>Luann.</p>
<p><strong>Man 1 [crying]</strong>: My money.</p>
<p><strong>Man 2 [crying]</strong>: Arlene!</p>
<p>[MEN CRYING]</p>
<p>[MEN HOWLING]</p>
<p>Do I dare to go up? Or is the love that waits behind that window just a lie?</p>
<p>Uh, Homer, I think you want your house next door?</p>
<p>Pfft, stupid Flanders with his misleading silhouette.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I have no choice but to go back home and...</p>
<p>Hey. I never noticed that newspaper box.</p>
<p>&quot;Apartment Finder. We put you in your place.</p>
<p>Roommate wanted for three-bedroom apartment.</p>
<p>Spacious, river view, only $400 a month&quot;?</p>
<p>Thank you, news box.</p>
<p>Ah! It's gone.</p>
<p>All right. I got me a place to put my &quot;spiderses.&quot;</p>
<p>What a well-kept street.</p>
<p>And there sure are a lot of gay bookstores for a straight neighborhood.</p>
<p>It's a cinch these guys never had any kids.</p>
<p>[BOTH GRUNT]</p>
<p>Hey, Mr. Smithers.</p>
<p>Ha. Hello, Simpson.</p>
<p>What's the deal with this place? It's so manly, yet scented.</p>
<p>Ha, ha. Yes, I seem to have gotten lost on my way to the, uh... big auto, uh, racing festival.</p>
<p>So I've never been here before.</p>

<p>Hey, Waylon.</p>
<p>Who's the bear? Woof!</p>
<p>Ooh, is that the Mr. Burns you're always talking about?</p>
<p>No. He's nobody. Shut up, Stewart.</p>
<p>Nice to meet you, Stewart.</p>
<p>Homer, before you move in... you should know that Julio and I have an active social life.</p>
<p>Me too. I'm a member of this club... where if I eat one more sub, I get a free sub sandwich.</p>
<p>You probably saw the ad where this guy used to be fat but now he's just ugly.</p>
<p>Homer, what Grady is saying is that... How can I put this?</p>
<p>Look, we might have a cocktails, say, where all the guests are male.</p>
<p>Are you trying to tell me that you guys are those guys that like guys?</p>
<p>That's right, Homer. We're gay.</p>
<p>You are? Hmm. Which will win out?</p>
<p>My old-fashioned prejudices... or that I've already mixed my laundry with yours.</p>
<p>I'll have to sleep on it.</p>
<p>[HOMER YAWNS]</p>
<p>[SNORING]</p>
<p>He's sleeping in the pantry.</p>
<p>Ah! My spices.</p>
<p>You guys lead a fascinating life.</p>
<p>Why are you reading <em>The New York Times? </em>You don't live in New York.</p>
<p>Oh, I despise the <em>Springfield Shopper. </em> What is that? The headlines are jokes.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p>Where'd you buy this? From the guy on the exit ramp? Disgusting.</p>
<p>Calm down, Picky Ricardo.</p>
<p>He made us a great breakfast and you're just riding his butt... and not in a good way.</p>
<p>Thank you, Homer. It's a pleasure cooking for you.</p>
<p>Well, get used to it because I'm gonna stay.</p>
<p>Fabulous. Here's the key to the lotion cabinet.</p>
<p>Grady, are you sure you want to live with him?</p>
<p>It's either him or that girl who put &quot;Mother Earth&quot; as a reference.</p>
<p>And with a male roommate, we can walk around naked.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Way ahead of you.</p>
<p>[HOMER HUMMING]</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>Don't worry, sweetie. Your father won't stay mad forever.</p>
<p>It's so weird not having Dad here.</p>
<p>I can't fall asleep if I haven't read him his bedtime story.</p>
<p>[PHONE RINGS]</p>
<p>Hello? Hold on.</p>
<p>&quot;Nancy Drew let out a low whistle.</p>
<p>'This isn't an old windmill at all. It's a new windmill.&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>No, Dad. I'm sure she won't be k*ll.</p>
<p><em>[PET SHOP BOYS' &quot;WEST END GIRLS&quot; PLAYING]</p>
<p>In a West End town, a dead end world.</p>
<p>The East End boys and West End girls.</p>
<p>West End girls.</p>
<p>West End girls</em></p>
<p>That will be $100.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>[BARBER SHRIEKS]</p>
<p>Dad took us antiquing.</p>
<p>Yeah. Along the way, we took photos of interesting doors and gates.</p>
<p>Your father sure can be thoughtful when he wants to be.</p>
<p>Marge, please. Let's not fight in front of the kids.</p>
<p>Just secretly hate me the way you always have.</p>
<p>I love watching you guys fight. It's my earliest memory.</p>
<p>Why, you little...!</p>
<p>Aah!</p>
<p>Dad, your hands feel so soft.</p>
<p>You noticed. I've been using Lancôme.</p>
<p>Ugh. Oh, it shows.</p>
<p>I haven't had a strangle that smooth since I was 4.</p>
<p>Well, I better go. But before I do, Marge, there's something I wanna ask you.</p>
<p>Yes, Homie?</p>
<p>How much do you tip a leg waxer? I need to know by tomorrow.</p>
<p>Just go. And take your stupid Lhasa Apso with you.</p>
<p>[DOG YELPS]</p>
<p>[DOOR CLOSES]</p>
<p>Mom, I know Dad cares about you, but his feelings are really hurt.</p>
<p>Why don't you just say you're sorry?</p>
<p>Lisa, marriage is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>But it's also a constant battle for moral superiority.</p>
<p>So I can't apologize.</p>
<p>Couldn't you just say you're sorry and not mean it? I do it all the time.</p>
<p>I don't think I've ever meant it.</p>
<p>That's not right.</p>
<p>Sorry, Mom.</p>
<p>See? It's that easy.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>[DANCE MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]</p>
<p>So how was your visit home?</p>
<p>The kids are cool. But Marge is still judging me.</p>
<p>Oh, so it's over between you two?</p>
<p>Maybe it is.</p>
<p>I used to look at Marge and get the same tingle you get when you see Rip Taylor.</p>
<p>I don't know what's gonna happen.</p>
<p>Come on, let's dance.</p>
<p>[CHEERING AND CHATTERING]</p>
<p>Hey, hey. Whoo!</p>
<p><strong>Man 1</strong>: Yeah, baby. You go.</p>
<p>I didn't think it was possible.</p>
<p>But watching him makes me more lesbian.</p>
<p>Lesbian?</p>
<p>This isn't my Army reunion.</p>
<p>You're coming home with me.</p>
<p>Yes, colonel.</p>
<p>He's gay. He's gay.</p>
<p>Gay. Gay. Bi.</p>
<p>Gay. Gay for pay. Gay.</p>
<p>Tennessee Williams?</p>
<p>But how did he survive in the world of theater?</p>
<p>Homer, please.</p>
<p>Practically everyone who's acted in, produced, or even seen a play is gay.</p>
<p>Uh, Homer, I think you should see this.</p>
<p>Homie, I tried to tell you how I feel but I can't find the right words.</p>
<p>Maybe he can.</p>
<p>&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic?</p>
<p>Marge wrote me about what happened.</p>
<p>And as soon as her check cleared, I was on the first flight here.</p>
<p>You get the parody songs I sent you?</p>
<p>Ugh, yes.</p>
<p>Which one was better?</p>
<p>&quot;Living La Pizza Loca&quot; or &quot;Another One Bites the Crust&quot;?</p>
<p>They were pretty much the same.</p>
<p>Yeah. Like you and Allan Sherman.</p>
<p>Now, here's a song I wrote for you.</p>
<p>[PLAYING TUNE OF JOHN MELLENCAMP'S &quot;JACK AND DIANE&quot;]</p>
<p>[SINGING] <em>Little ditty about Homer and Marge.</p>
<p>Her heart was as big As his stomach was large.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, they say love goes on.</p>
<p>Long after the grilled cheese sandwich ls gone</em></p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]</p>
<p>It would take a man of stone with a funny bone of steel to resist that.</p>
<p>Homer, would you at least let me take you out on a date?</p>
<p>I don't know. Date a chick with kids?</p>
<p>Dad...</p>
<p>All right, all right.</p>
<p>Nice work, Lisa.</p>
<p>Thanks, Julio.</p>
<p>I love you as a blond.</p>
<p>You do? Oh, God, Lisa, if I was an 8-year-old straight boy... I would be holding your hand right now.</p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]</p>
<p>[HUMMING]</p>
<p>Ooh, wait. Marge likes a little bit of stubble.</p>
<p>Uh-oh. Gotta even it out.</p>
<p>[GRUNTING]</p>
<p>Somebody's nervous.</p>
<p>Well, we got the cure for that. Margaritas.</p>
<p>Margarita? That's Mexican for Marge.</p>
<p>I'll take that as a sign.</p>
<p>[TRUMPET FANFARE PLAYS]</p>
<p><strong>Marge (thinking)</strong>: <em>Where is he? Where is he?</em></p>
<p>Who dares challenge ye Black Knight?</p>
<p>Step forward if ye be free of lower back pain, heart conditions, and pregnancy.</p>
<p>And please turn off thy cell phones and pagers.</p>
<p>[GROANS]</p>
<p>I've learned a lot living here.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter what someone's sexual preferences are... unless they're a celebrity.</p>
<p>In which case, it's dish, dish, dish.</p>
<p>Homer, weren't you supposed to meet your wife half an hour ago?</p>
<p>D'oh! You don't have a gay time machine, do you?</p>
<p>Yes. It's called Grady's shoe closet. Ha.</p>
<p>Hey, Julio? Ouch.</p>
<p>I gotta go.</p>
<p>[TRUMPET FANFARE PLAYS]</p>
<p><strong>Comic book guy</strong>: Oh. Oh, lordy.</p>
<p>Now for ye knights' and wenches' delectation... I have some royal proclamations.</p>
<p>We welcome Cub Scout Troop Number 102.</p>
<p>We wish a happy birthday to Karen.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Marge and Homer Simpson on their reconciliation dinner.</p>
<p>[GROANS]</p>
<p>Oh, sorry I'm late. The Velvet Mafia made me a margarita I couldn't refuse.</p>
<p>Goodbye, Homer. I try to save our marriage.</p>
<p>You just get drunk and spend the whole night with your homosexual boyfriends.</p>
<p>Reverend Lovejoy, Mrs. Lovejoy, Principal Skinner, Duffman.</p>
<p>Fact is, certain people aren't right for each other.</p>
<p>You gave it a chance, it didn't work.</p>
<p>At least you tried.</p>
<p>But it was Marge, my first and only love.</p>
<p>I'm like David Spade without Chris Farley, alone and useless.</p>
<p>Oh, Homer, a guy as cool and special as you will have no trouble... believe me.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Wow. I never realized you felt about me that way.</p>
<p>We should take some time to talk...</p>
<p>[GRUNTS]</p>
<p>I'd just end up hurting you!</p>
<p>[FOOTSTEPS]</p>
<p>I was just thinking, my problems with Marge started because I drink too much.</p>
<p>And then tonight, alcohol only made things worse.</p>
<p>Maybe all of my problems are actually caused by...</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Take your medicine, you lush, you.</p>
<p>[GULPING]</p>
<p>[WHISTLING]</p>
<p>Hey, what happened here?</p>
<p>Uh, he was drinking at Harrigan's bar down the street there.</p>
<p>They ought to close that dump down.</p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That was a close call. We took this much out of you.</p>
<p>But it's still not as bad as the first time I treated you.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. The night that destroyed my marriage.</p>
<p>Destroyed your marriage?</p>
<p>Why, I'd never seen a woman look so devoted.</p>
<p>Let's look at the tape.</p>
<p>You have that on tape?</p>
<p>Mm, it was back when I thought the nurse was stealing sponges.</p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]</p>
<p><em>He's stable now. I'll leave you two alone.</p>
<p>Homie, I was so worried about you.</p>
<p>I was really mad at you tonight.</p>
<p>But you're a good person. And that's whatl see most of the time.</p>
<p>Whatever problems we have... we have a lifetime to work them out together.</em></p>
<p>So she didn't hate me.</p>
<p>She married me because she loved me.</p>
<p>And I still do.</p>
<p>Marge, I never wanna be apart from you again.</p>
<p>Well, you'll never have to.</p>
<p>That is the best kiss I've had tonight.</p>
<p>[THINKING] <em>Or was it?</em></p>
<p>Homie, what are you thinking?</p>
<p>Manly thoughts.</p>
<p>All I have left now are my tapes.</p>
<p>She was stealing sponges. I knew it.</p>
<p>[SINGING] <em>That's a story about Homer and Marge.</p>
<p>Two folks I helped out For a nominal charge.</p>
<p>After Homer went gay They patched up their schism.</p>
<p>But the dude never dealt With his alcoholism.</p>
<p>Weird Al saying &quot;Oh, yeah, the credits go on.</p>
<p>Long after the viewer's interest ls gone&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, yeah Weird Al had fun on this show.</p>
<p>Even if it was just a brief cameo</em></p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Shh.</p>
