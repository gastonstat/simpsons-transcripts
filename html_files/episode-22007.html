							<p><em>The Simpsons</em></p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Movie For A Rained-Out Ballgame now returns... to Dyan Cannon, Troy McClure and the Muppets... in the 1977 film...</p>
<p><em>The Muppets Go Medieval.</em></p>
<p>Oh, Princess fair, whilst thou grant me thine dainty hoof in marriage?</p>
<p>Oh, Sir Liesalot, I will!</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p><em>Unhand the swine, you swain.</em></p>
<p>Come, Piggy. Back to Hamelot.</p>
<p>Not now, frog. Me and lron-Pants are just getting acquainted.</p>
<p>Dad, what's a &quot;Muppet?&quot;</p>
<p>Well, it's not quite a mop and it's not quite a puppet, but, man-</p>
<p>So, to answer your question, I don't know.</p>
<p><em>Parry.</p>
<p>Why'd they make that one Muppet out ofleather?</em></p>
<p>That's not a leather Muppet. That's Troy McClure.</p>
<p>Oh, back in the '70s, he was quite the teen heartthrob.</p>
<p>Yeah. Who'd have thought he'd turn out to be such a weirdo?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>You know, his bizarre personal life.</p>
<p>Those weird things they say he does down at the aquarium. Why, I heard-</p>
<p>Oh, Homer! That's just an urban legend.</p>
<p>People don't do that type of thing with fish.</p>
<p>Troy McClure's a perfect gentleman, like Bing Crosby orJ.F.K.</p>
<p>I wonder where Troy is now.</p>
<p><em>Uh-oh. Oh. Oh.</p>
<p>Hey, these guys are all over the road.!</em></p>
<p>All right, Captain Rush-Rush. Out of the car.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm seeing stars here!</p>
<p>No, just one. Hi. I'm Troy McClure.</p>
<p><em>You may remember me from such films as The Greatest Story Ever Hulaed... and They Came to Burgle Carnegie Hall.</em></p>
<p>Uh, afraid not. License, please.</p>
<p>It says here you need corrective lenses. Put those glasses on, mister.</p>
<p>You wouldn't ask a handsome man like me to wear glasses!</p>
<p>It'd be a crime against nature!</p>
<p>Well, they do kind of make you look like a nerd.</p>
<p>Tell you what. Just go down to the D.M.V. tomorrow and try to pass that eye test.</p>
<p>I'll tear up this ticket, but I'm still gonna have to ask you for a bribe.</p>
<p>Hello, Marge. Hello, Marge.</p>
<p>How come no Chippendales dancers... ever come in to renew their licenses?</p>
<p>They carpool. That's the problem.</p>
<p>Hey, I came here to get this revoked!</p>
<p>Troy McClure? I thought he disappeared after that scandal at the aquarium.</p>
<p>Hey, I thought you said Troy McClure was dead!</p>
<p>No. What I said was he sleeps with the fishes. You see-</p>
<p>Uh, Tony, please! No. I just ate a whole plate of&quot;dingamagoo.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh! Troy McClure!</p>
<p>Hello, beautiful.</p>
<p>John Law tells me I might need to wear these glasses.</p>
<p>You? Nonsense. You're Troy McClure.</p>
<p><em>I remember you from such films as Meet Joe Blow... and Give My Remains to Broadway.</em></p>
<p>Stars like you don't need glasses.</p>
<p>Yuck!</p>
<p>Now, Mr. McClure, would you like to take off those glasses... and read the top line?</p>
<p>Uh, W...</p>
<p><em>seven, star, pound.</em></p>
<p>Look, Miss... &quot;Boo-Veer.&quot;</p>
<p>As an actor, I depend on my remarkable looks.</p>
<p>If you could find it in your heart to pass me...</p>
<p>I'm sure I could find some way to repay you.</p>
<p>Say by buying you dinner?</p>
<p>That took a lot of class.</p>
<p>All these celebrities on the walls.</p>
<p><em>I just know a big star like you is up there somewhere.</em></p>
<p>Uh, yes. I'm over there.</p>
<p><em>Hmm? Hmm.</p>
<p>Hmm. Mm-mmm. Hmm.</p>
<p>Hmm. Oh.!</em></p>
<p>So, working at the D.M.V. must be very interesting.</p>
<p>Well, I think I'm getting Repetitive Stress Disorder... from scratching my butt all day.</p>
<p>Being a huge movie star must be good too.</p>
<p>What are you working on now?</p>
<p>I've been reading a lot of scripts lately.</p>
<p>You know, it's a lot cheaper than going to the movies.</p>
<p>Well, thanks for holding up your end of the bargain.</p>
<p>I had a pretty good time.</p>
<p>Yeah. Me too. You need a ride somewhere?</p>
<p>Hey, get a load of this! Troy McClure on what looks like a date!</p>
<p>Here you go, boys. A little something for page one.</p>
<p><em>Hey, Homer.! Isn't this your sister-in-law on a date with Troy McClure?</em></p>
<p>Troy McClure. He's a washed-up movie star.</p>
<p>He could be dating washed-up supermodels.</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know.</p>
<p>Maybe those rumors about his fish fetish weren't true after all.</p>
<p>This changes everything. I'd pay to see him in a movie now.</p>
<p>If only that were possible.</p>
<p><em>Troy! My man! It's MacArthur Parker!</em></p>
<p>MacArthur Parker, the agent?</p>
<p><em>MacArthur Parker, my agent?</p>
<p>Just checking in, my friend. So, how's my favorite client?</em></p>
<p>We haven't spoken in eight years.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So, I saw the papers today, Troy. Looking good.</p>
<p>That wholesome stuff really helps when I'm trying to find you work.</p>
<p>You haven't found me work in 12 years.</p>
<p>Oh, you! Jury duty is work.</p>
<p>And, listen, you keep getting seen in public with human females... and I can get you work in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p><em>Hey.!</em></p>
<p>Hello. Selma Bouvier? It's Troy McClure.</p>
<p>You may remember me from such dates as last night's dinner.</p>
<p>Hey! Troy! Troy!</p>
<p>That's right, boys.</p>
<p>Troy's back from the gutter, and he's brought someone with him!</p>
<p>That's too funny!</p>
<p>I can't remember when I've heard a funnier anecdote!</p>
<p>Okay, now you tell one.</p>
<p>Well, not much happens to me... but I once had dinner with a movie star... and it was the most wonderful night of my life.</p>
<p>Really? Who was it? George Segal?</p>
<p>I hear he plays the banjo.</p>
<p>Hmm, yeah.</p>
<p>Excuse me. I ordered a Zima, not &quot;emphysema.&quot;</p>
<p>Please, don't smoke in our restaurant.</p>
<p>We don't serve contemporary California cuisine in your lungs.</p>
<p>Troy, uh, I'm sorry I ruined our evening.</p>
<p>I have to go now. Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Oh, God! I'm such a fool.</p>
<p><em>Got a light?</em></p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Sounds like you're really falling for him.</p>
<p>What's the matter? I'm not fun enough for you?</p>
<p>Patty! Go on, Selma. Tell me more.</p>
<p>I don't want to jinx it, Marge, but this could be it.</p>
<p>He asked me out again this Friday.</p>
<p>He's taking me to a special screening of his latest film.</p>
<p>You know, smoke actually smells good when it's coming outta you.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm all out.</p>
<p>Here. Try one of my cigars.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>My God! It's like five cigarettes at once!</p>
<p>Oh, my head is swimming!</p>
<p>That's not cigars, baby. That's love.</p>
<p>No longer canst I conceal my love, my wimpled turtledove.</p>
<p>Oh, Princess fair, whilst thou grant me thine dainty hoof in marriage?</p>
<p><em>Oh, Troy!</p>
<p>Oh, Sir Liesalot.!</em></p>
<p>I will!</p>
<p>Ohh!</p>
<p>Just a second, baby.</p>
<p>Tonight, '70s leading man Troy McClure has finally met the woman of his dreams.</p>
<p>We may remember- Woman? Huh. Okay.</p>
<p>We may remember Troy from such films...</p>
<p><em>as The Verdict Was Mail Fraud and Leper in the Backfield.</em></p>
<p>With his high-profile romance...</p>
<p>Troy's managed to shake the rumors that have dogged his career.</p>
<p>And with news of his upcoming wedding, rumor has it he's up for some very choice roles.</p>
<p>Looks like you were wrong when you called him a washed-up deviant, Laurie.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Make sure my iguana's okay.</p>
<p>Selma, Jub Jub is fantastic!</p>
<p>He's everywhere you want to be.</p>
<p>Welcome to your new home, baby. It's fantastic!</p>
<p>Garbage collection is Monday. If you want to throw out a box, you have to cut it up.</p>
<p>It's so modern.</p>
<p>It's ultramodern, like living in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p>Now, you make yourself at home here.</p>
<p>I'll be sleeping downstairs in the visitor's center.</p>
<p>Oh. Okay.</p>
<p>I'll see you in the morning, and get ready for tennis.</p>
<p>It comes on at 10:00.</p>
<p><em>Troy, Mac Parker. Ever hear of Planet of the Apes?</em></p>
<p>Uh, the movie or the planet?</p>
<p>The brand-new, multi-million-dollar musical!</p>
<p>And you are starring... as the human.</p>
<p>It's the part I was born to play, baby!</p>
<p>Help. The human's about to escape.</p>
<p>Get your paws off me, you dirty ape!</p>
<p>He can talk!</p>
<p>He can talk. He can talk. He can talk! He can talk!</p>
<p><em>He can talk.! He can talk.!</p>
<p>I can sing.</p>
<p>Ooh! Help me, Dr. Zaius!</em></p>
<p>Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius.</p>
<p>Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius.</p>

<p>Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius Oh, Dr. Zaius.</p>
<p>Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius.</p>
<p>What's wrong with me.</p>
<p>I think you're crazy.</p>
<p>Want a second opinion.</p>
<p>You're also lazy.</p>
<p>Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius.</p>
<p>Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius.</p>
<p>Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius, oh, Dr. Zaius.</p>
<p>Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius.</p>
<p>Can I play the piano anymore.</p>
<p>Of course you can.</p>
<p>Well, I couldn't before <em>Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius.</p>
<p>This play has everything.</em></p>
<p>Oh, I love legitimate theater.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Zaius, Dr. Zaius</em></p>
<p>I hate every ape I see.</p>
<p>From chimpan-A to chimpan-Z</p>
<p>No, you'll never make a monkey.</p>
<p>Out of me.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, I was wrong.</p>
<p>It was Earth all along.</p>
<p>You finally made a monkey.</p>
<p>Yes, we finally made a monkey.</p>
<p>Yes, you finally.</p>
<p>Made a monkey.</p>
<p>Out of me.</p>
<p>I love you, Dr. Zaius.</p>
<p>Thank you. It's great to be back.</p>
<p>I just want to say I wouldn't be here without the support of a very special lady- my always outrageous fiancée, Selma.</p>
<p>Take a bow, sugar beet.</p>
<p>Oh. Well. Thank you.</p>
<p><em>Down in front!</em></p>
<p>My good looks paid for that pool... and my talent filled it with water.</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Troy McClure, your future uncle.</p>
<p>Hi. I remember you from such filmstrips... <em>as locker room towel fight: The Blinding of Larry Driscoll.</em></p>
<p>I was one of the first to speak out against horseplay.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Remember when we were kids, we used to dream about our ideal husbands?</p>
<p>Who knew the dream would come true for one of us?</p>
<p>Oh, come on! Guess which one.</p>
<p>I know. I know. It's Selma, right?</p>
<p><em>Yeah, that's a good idea, Homer... but they've already made some movies about World w*r II.</em></p>
<p>Aw, hell! Well, what about Dracula?</p>
<p>Homer, I'm really touched you invited me out on the town.</p>
<p>You're gonna be a four-star brother-in-law.</p>
<p>Troy, buddy, I got to know.</p>
<p>What's a great guy like you want to marry a guy like Selma?</p>
<p>Come here, Homer.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I'll let you in on a little secret.</p>
<p>And do you, Selma Bouvier Terwilliger Bouvier... take the fabulous Troy McClure to be your lawful wedded husband?</p>
<p>I already told you yes.</p>
<p>If anyone here knows why this couple should not be wed in holy matrimony... let him speak now or forever hold his peace.</p>
<p>Da-da da-da-da Hey!</p>
<p>Da-da-da-da, da-da da-da-da Hey! Da-da.</p>
<p>I now pronounce you husband and wife.</p>
<p>You may now kiss... each other.</p>
<p>This is the best day of my life.</p>
<p>It's a good day for me too, baby.</p>
<p>Now, smile. We're gonna be on every newsstand in the country.</p>
<p>Mwah!</p>
<p>Hey! Look what I snagged, Marge.</p>
<p>The candy bride and groom from the wedding cake.</p>
<p>Mmm. Pointy.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful wedding. I've never seen Selma happier.</p>
<p>That reminds me-Troy said something interesting last night at the bar.</p>
<p>Apparently, he doesn't really love Selma... and the marriage is just a sham to help his career.</p>
<p>Well, enough talk. Let's snuggle.</p>
<p>What? Oh, my God!</p>
<p><em>Marge, could you close your eyes?</p>
<p>I'm trying to sleep.</p>
<p>There.</em></p>
<p>This better be important. It's my wedding night. I'm trying to sleep.</p>
<p>Sleep is for has-beens, my friend, and you're about to have a very crowded schedule.</p>
<p>This marriage scam is paying off big-time.</p>
<p>Phone for you.</p>
<p>T. McC.!</p>
<p>Troy, darling, come to bed.</p>
<p>I want to see the Troy McClure I remember from such films...</p>
<p><em>as Make-Out King of Montana and The Electric Gigolo.</em></p>
<p>Yeah. In a minute, darling.</p>
<p>Well, she may be helping my career, but she's starting to cramp my style.</p>
<p>Oh, who cares? The offers are rolling in.</p>
<p>Paramount wants you for a buddy comedy with Rob Lowe and Hugh Grant.</p>
<p>Those sick freaks?</p>
<p>Okay. Then get this.</p>
<p>I think they want you to play McBain's sidekick in- brace yourself- the new McBain movie!</p>
<p>McBain's sidekick? Hot damn!</p>
<p>I'm going to Sea World!</p>
<p>Selma, about you and Troy-</p>
<p>We're not sure he's all he seems.</p>
<p>Marge is right. He's wrong for you.</p>
<p>Better you find out sooner than later.</p>
<p>Wrong for me? How? Oh, I get it.</p>
<p>My sisters have come down with a case of the green-eyed gazungas.</p>
<p>I guess I shouldn't be surprised.</p>
<p>You're stuck in a menial job you'll be doing 10 years after you die.</p>
<p>And you're tied down to a man who'd have to bathe to be a slob.</p>
<p>Selma, Troy doesn't love you at all.</p>
<p>He's only using you to squelch the rumors about his bizarre personal life... and further his career.</p>
<p>You don't know what you're talking about... and I have to go now and see Troy.</p>
<p>Is this a sham marriage?</p>
<p>Sure, baby. Is that a problemo?</p>
<p>You married me just to help your career?</p>
<p>You make it sound so sordid.</p>
<p>Look, don't we have a good time together?</p>
<p>Yes, but-</p>
<p>Don't you have everything you ever wanted here?</p>
<p>Money, security, a big, hot, flat rock for Jub Jub?</p>
<p>But... don't you love me?</p>
<p>Sure, I do, like I love Fresca. Isn't that enough?</p>
<p>The only difference between our marriage and anyone else's is we know ours is a sham.</p>
<p>Are you gay?</p>
<p>Gay? I wish!</p>
<p>If I were gay, there'd be no problem.</p>
<p>No, what I have is a romantic abnormality... one so unbelievable that it must be hidden from the public at all costs.</p>
<p>You see-</p>
<p>Stop!</p>
<p>You're asking me to live a lie.</p>
<p>I don't know if I can do that.</p>
<p>It's remarkably easy.</p>
<p>Just smile for the cameras and enjoy Mr. Troy's Wild Ride.</p>
<p>You'll go to the right parties, meet the right people.</p>
<p>Sure, you'll be a sham wife... but you'll be the envy of every other sham wife in town.</p>
<p>So, what do you say, baby?</p>
<p>Tell me again about Mr. Troy's Wild Ride.</p>
<p>One day, my lady Selma's gonna have a star right next to mine... so watch out, Laszlo Panaflex.</p>
<p>Tonight all Hollywood's wondering who'll be chosen to costar...</p>
<p><em>in the big, new McBain pic, McBain IV: Fatal Discharge.</em></p>
<p>Oh! You watching?</p>
<p>Mac, you gotta get me that part.</p>
<p>I will, but you gotta do something for me.</p>
<p>The problem is, the big parts these days are all going to family men.</p>
<p>But I already got married!</p>
<p>Yeah, but for a role like this, you gotta pour it on-you and wife have gotta have a baby.</p>
<p>A baby, eh? What do I do?</p>
<p>I'll send you over a pamphlet.</p>
<p>You can't buy that kind of P.R., but you can get it for nothing by having a baby... which, by the way, your insurance will cover except for the deductible... which I'll reimburse you for if you get the part... which you will if you have a baby.</p>
<p><em>C'est Troy bien.</p>
<p>Okay. Now, listen. Let's talk baby names.</em></p>
<p>You can't use Montana, Dakota or Florida- they're taken.</p>
<p>Mmm. Oregon?</p>
<p>Oh! Pacific Northwest. Very hot.</p>
<p>Having a child- that's a big step.</p>
<p>You bet it is! Think what it'll mean!</p>
<p>Not just the McBain movie, but maybe my own fragrance- &quot;Smellin' ofTroy&quot;!</p>
<p>It is probably my last chance to be a mommy.</p>
<p>Cigarette, Mrs. McClure?</p>
<p>You bet! From now on, she's smoking for two!</p>
<p>Uh, come here, tiger.</p>
<p>Hmm. Would you like some wine?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Uh, why don't you come over here... and make yourself more comfortable?</p>
<p><em>No. Why don't you come over here and make yourself comfortable?</em></p>
<p>I'm sorry. This whole concept's foreign to me.</p>
<p>Who knew a baby would be so much work?</p>
<p>Having a baby isn't supposed to be work.</p>
<p>It's supposed to be an expression of the feelings... we're supposed to have for each other.</p>
<p>Oh. Like how we built that snowman together in that Newport ad?</p>
<p>Remember how &quot;alive with pleasure&quot; they said we were?</p>
<p>Look, I'm sorry. A loveless marriage is one thing.</p>
<p>We're not hurting anybody.</p>
<p>But bringing a child into a loveless family... is something I just can't do.</p>
<p>Oh, great! We'll adopt.</p>
<p>I'll call my agent. He'll find some kid who wants in on the deal.</p>
<p>Good-bye, Troy.</p>
<p>I'll always remember you, but not from your films.</p>
<p>Come on, Jub Jub.</p>
<p>Let's go home, and I'll microwave you some nice roaches.</p>
<p>In a bold move that has stunned Hollywood insiders... newly divorced comeback kid Troy McClure...</p>
<p><em>has turned down the supporting lead in McBain IV...</em> to direct and star in his own pet project...</p>
<p>The Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel.</p>
<p>Will the gambit pay off?</p>
<p>20th Century Fox is betting... it will.</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
