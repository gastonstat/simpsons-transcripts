Smoke on the Daughter</p>
<p>Bart, it's me!</p>
<p>I'm Lord Evilton from the Angelica Button books.</p>
<p>The last book in the series goes on sale at midnight and we're going to go stand in line.</p>
<p>Wait in line for a book?!</p>
<p>You tell 'em Bart says hey.</p>
<p>Come on, boy.</p>
<p>All the nerds are doing it.</p>
<p>I'm not a nerd. I'm a jock who's too cool for sports.</p>
<p>It's the final book!</p>
<p>I wonder what happens?</p>
<p>Maybe the Sandrux is the Narcolops.</p>
<p>I read a rumor Spider-man's in it.</p>
<p>Shut up! Shut up!</p>
<p>This is a spoiler-free zone.</p>
<p>Nice Angelica Button costume, Lisa.</p>
<p>Although... the gryphon on your coat of arms is facing left not right.</p>
<p>And FYI, Angelica wears two tortoise shell barrs.</p>
<p>Nice try, though.</p>
<p>I based my costume on the books, not the movies.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm going to hand out colored bracelets.</p>
<p>The color on your bracelet will determine...</p>
<p>Move or die!</p>
<p>It's for my kid!</p>
<p>Eureka!</p>
<p>Now read it to me!</p>
<p>&quot;The Dark Lord has summoned you&quot; said the withered troll.</p>
<p>Do the character voices!</p>
<p>&quot;And bring your cloak.</p>
<p>The torture room can be frightfully chilly.&quot;</p>
<p>Angelica's first kiss, da-da-da.</p>
<p>Subplot about her cat, who cares?</p>
<p>Professor Skizzletwitch is a Were-bear, and, uh, no, no, he's not.</p>
<p>Maluicious Krubb is actually Kraluicious Mubb.</p>
<p>All is lost, Angelica uses the spell she learned in chapter six.</p>
<p>Magic, magic, magic, all is won.</p>
<p>Well, that's our book for the year.</p>
<p>I think we've earned some TV.</p>
<p>TV! TV! TV!</p>
<p>But kids, I want you in bed by 3:00 a.m.</p>
<p>Hey, somebody's got to be the bad guy.</p>
<p>But I don't understand, how could he have m*rder his wife if he was making a phone call 3,000 miles away?</p>
<p>Well, maybe he reached out done and k*ll someone.</p>
<p>I saw this. He trained his dog to do it.</p>
<p>Up next, which former Friends star is speaking out against adult illiteracy?</p>
<p>It's Lisa Kudrow.</p>
<p>Stop saying things, Bart.</p>
<p>That's the TV's job.</p>
<p>And the First Lady has agreed to sit on the egg until it hatches.</p>
<p>More after this.</p>
<p>See that? That's talent.</p>
<p>You think you got it? You don't.</p>
<p>'Cause only I can teach it and I ain't taught you, so you don't.</p>
<p>The Chazz Busby Ballet Academy is coming to Springfield.</p>
<p>Auditions are Monday.</p>
<p>Callbacks are Tuesday.</p>
<p>Wednesday, you see I'm a heartless bastard.</p>
<p>Thursday you realize you love me, damn it.</p>
<p>Friday, we're closed.</p>
<p>You're fired.</p>
<p>You're her.</p>
<p>Jump, dance, love.</p>
<p>A ballet academy here in Springfield?</p>
<p>Move over, Europe!</p>
<p>I didn't know you cared about ballet.</p>
<p>Lisa, have I ever shown you my Shattered Dreams Box?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It's upstairs in my Disappointment Closet.</p>
<p>There were so many things I wanted to do in life that I never got a chance to do: doctor, safecracker, stethoscope sales lady.</p>
<p>None came to pass.</p>
<p>But the thing I really wanted to be, ever since I was little, was a ballerina.</p>
<p>So what happened?</p>
<p>My bosoms came in and ruined my balance.</p>
<p>Really? How?</p>
<p>They came in one at a time.</p>
<p>Oh... do you think mine...?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure you'll have your dad's boobs.</p>
<p>Mom, it's not too late to un-shatter your dream.</p>
<p>Martha Graham danced well into her 70s.</p>
<p>You mean she danced well, into her 70s?</p>
<p>Or she danced, well into her 70s?</p>
<p>Well, she danced into her 70s.</p>
<p>I think you've got a point.</p>
<p>Homie, I'm gonna be a dancer!</p>
<p>Go-go or boring?</p>
<p>Boring!</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>Okay, ladies, listen up: Forget everything you've ever learned about ballet... good.</p>
<p>Now, from Bolshoi Fifth Position, give me a Battement Glisse, a Double Changement, two Swan Lake Fouettés, then finish with a Grand Pas De Chat.</p>
<p>Now show me what you got, uh...</p>
<p>Simpson, comma, Marge.</p>
<p>I haven't seen dancing like that since my Broadway show Dancing Like That.</p>
<p>Closed in a week.</p>
<p>Too smart for the corndog crowd, too dumb for the bagel bunch.</p>
<p>You keep it up, kid.</p>
<p>You got something.</p>
<p>Son, while your mother and little mother are out, I'm gonna let you in on a deep, dark family secret.</p>
<p>You have a drinking problem?</p>
<p>I said secret.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what I do in that locked room?</p>
<p>Gay out?</p>
<p>Well, wonder no more!</p>
<p>Beef jerky!</p>
<p>The queen of all the jerkys!</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>Now, I'll cut and you soak.</p>
<p>Dad, marinating with you is cool.</p>
<p>Thanks, son.</p>
<p>Some of that is cow bl*od.</p>
<p>Look, Lise! I'm as supple as ever!</p>
<p>It won't go down.</p>
<p>Marge, Marge, Marge... you know what they say, those who cannot do...</p>
<p>Teach?</p>
<p>No, they go home.</p>
<p>How can they teach if they can't do?</p>
<p>Get out!</p>
<p>You can't talk to my mom like that.</p>
<p>Who the hell... taught you to stand like that?</p>
<p>This is how I always stand when I tell adults what they should be doing.</p>
<p>You have naturally perfect posture.</p>
<p>I rarely say this, but, how would you like to become to a paying student at my dance academy?</p>
<p>Uh, I don't know, I...</p>
<p>We accept!</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I got confused.</p>
<p>You don't get to be &quot;confused.&quot;</p>
<p>Not till you've won six Tonys, gone into rehab, married your plastic surgeon, retired, and then un-retired in a special little show called Woman of the Year... you can't, uh...</p>
<p>Hey, I forget where I'm going with this.</p>
<p>Take a break, people.</p>
<p>Eh, eh, eh, en pointe!</p>
<p>This is so hard.</p>
<p>Get used to it.</p>
<p>We balerinas are under constant pressure to stay focused, skinny, graceful and skinny.</p>
<p>How do you cope with it?</p>
<p>You find out what works you.</p>
<p>For some people it might be yoga, for others, meditation.</p>
<p>But for every ballerina in the world, it's cigarettes.</p>
<p>Cigarettes?!</p>
<p>They can k*ll you.</p>
<p>They did a whole episode about it on.</p>
<p>The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.</p>
<p>Zack tried to impress a girl by smoking, but she went for Cody instead.</p>
<p>Zack's life wasn't so sweet then.</p>
<p>If God didn't want ballerinas to smoke, how come I can do this?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>All I need to stay focused is good old-fashioned fresh air.</p>
<p>Nothing like fresh air.</p>
<p>Fresh air.</p>
<p>Horrible, horrible, horrible... no longer describes your dancing, Lisa.</p>
<p>You're good, kid!</p>
<p>I've gotten better since this morning.</p>
<p>How could that have happened?</p>
<p>Maybe it's all the secondhand &quot;focus&quot; and &quot;pep&quot; you are inhaling.</p>
<p>They don't call these &quot;dancer sticks&quot; for nothin'.</p>
<p>I thought they were cancer sticks.</p>
<p>I dan't dear dou!</p>
<p>My Hindu friend, this is a chance for your Kwik-E-Mart to get in on the ground floor of a delicious new taste sensation.</p>
<p>You talk a good game, but do you have the product to back it up?</p>
<p>Step into our Jerkatorium.</p>
<p>What the...!</p>
<p>Where's our jerky?</p>
<p>You have wasted my time!</p>
<p>You have made a very powerless enemy.</p>
<p>Good day and be well!</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait!</p>
<p>You haven't seen our PowerPoint presentation...</p>
<p>Bart?</p>
<p>&quot;J,&quot; just the product you need.</p>
<p>&quot;E,&quot; excellent value.</p>
<p>&quot;R,&quot; retailer's dream.</p>
<p>&quot;K...&quot;</p>
<p>You can skip the &quot;K&quot; and the &quot;Y.&quot;</p>
<p>I do not thank you and I will not come again.</p>

<p>Who could have done this?</p>
<p>Well, something chewed through the cellar door and the floor is covered with paw prints... is can only mean one thing: Flanders, you ate my jerky!</p>
<p>As the oak said to the beagle, you're barkin' up the wrong tree.</p>
<p>I spent the whole morning blacking out the &quot;goshes&quot; and &quot;darns&quot; in these Hardy Boys books.</p>
<p>I know you ate my jerky just like I ate your earthquake supplies.</p>
<p>Dad, look! Raccoons!</p>
<p>You stay right here.</p>
<p>Okily dokily!</p>
<p>Ah! &quot;heck, darn.&quot;</p>
<p>I don't think so.</p>
<p>Lisa...</p>
<p>Lisa Simpson...</p>
<p>Time for a smoke.</p>
<p>Look, everyone knows that cigarettes are where flavor lives and a cool choice for a hot night.</p>
<p>But they're for losers!</p>
<p>Losers?</p>
<p>You mean losers like...</p>
<p>Simone de Beauvoir, Margaret Mead, Queen Elizabeth I, Lauren Bacall...</p>
<p>My feminist heroes!</p>
<p>Don't forget me Lillian Hellman!</p>
<p>Smoking gave me the energy I needed to write plays and inventiveness!</p>
<p>Bring out the Hellman's, and bring out the best.</p>
<p>Puff with us!</p>
<p>Puff with us!</p>
<p>Puff with us!</p>
<p>Yeah, that's it, don't be shy.</p>
<p>Enjoy your jerky laced with sleeping pills.</p>
<p>Nobody outwits Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>Hey, they're not sleepy.</p>
<p>Just turning fuzzy.</p>
<p>Homer, you ate their jerky.</p>
<p>I thought this might happen, so I brought the best w*apon to operate while drugged: a crossbow.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Chazz Busby says you're really making progress!</p>
<p>Do you need more leg warmers?</p>
<p>No, stop buying me leg warmers!</p>
<p>I'm already wearing six pairs!</p>
<p>Well, the important thing is, someday, I'll be watching my little Marge dancing at Lincoln Center.</p>
<p>Lisa, Mom. I'm Lisa.</p>
<p>Of course, you're Lisa.</p>
<p>Lisa the dancing Marge girl.</p>
<p>Dad, you never win a fight with animals.</p>
<p>Remember when you lost that w*r with the worms?</p>
<p>That wasn't a defeat, it was a phased withdrawal.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? They made you build this statue.</p>
<p>When you cut 'em, they multiply.</p>
<p>I can't fight that!</p>
<p>Now, let's take care of those raccoons.</p>
<p>Aw, they're using the jerky to feed their family.</p>
<p>Look, there's a Homer and a Bart and a Marge and a Lisa.</p>
<p>Aw, they even share my views on parenting!</p>
<p>Enjoy your jerky, little critters, and, one day, you'll grow up to be people.</p>
<p>Bart, get some more jerky for man's new best friend.</p>
<p>When's our next break?</p>
<p>When the big cigarette hits 9.</p>
<p>All right, that was pretty good for uncoordinated hippopotamuses.</p>
<p>Hit the river, ladies.</p>
<p>Go ahead, have a wallow.</p>
<p>What am I doing?</p>
<p>I don't need second hand smoke to do ballet...</p>
<p>I need firsthand smoke!</p>
<p>Lisa!</p>
<p>Give me that!</p>
<p>I can't believe how easy it is in this country to get cigarettes.</p>
<p>I can't believe you were smoking.</p>
<p>Did you know the &quot;sturgeon&quot; general said you're not supposed to?</p>
<p>A &quot;sturgeon&quot; is a fish.</p>
<p>And a very wise fish he is!</p>
<p>Marge, I'm taking Lisa out of that stupid...</p>
<p>What the...?</p>
<p>Oh, Homie, I've been so happy lately.</p>
<p>I'm completely fulfilled, both as a mother and a fan of youth ballet!</p>
<p>Now what did you want to say to me?</p>
<p>Are you sure you want Lisa to keep dancing?</p>
<p>There's nothing that makes a mother's heart soar more than seeing child take wing.</p>
<p>Look at me, I'm glowing!</p>
<p>Maybe you're drunk.</p>
<p>Homie, Lisa's dancing has made me really, really, happy.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, fatherhood hurts my brain.</p>
<p>Dad!</p>
<p>Dad, a little help?</p>
<p>You're on your own.</p>
<p>Because it means so much to your mother, you can keep doing ballet.</p>
<p>But you have to stop smoking, including secondhand!</p>
<p>That's easy for you to say.</p>
<p>You've never had to be thin and focused.</p>
<p>What'd you say?</p>
<p>I'm just saying it's gonna be hard for me to quit, especially before the recital.</p>
<p>I thought you might have trouble with this.</p>
<p>That's why I'm assigning someone to keep watch over you.</p>
<p>Someone you'd never expect.</p>
<p>Is it Bart?</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Come on out, boy.</p>
<p>For the next three days, I'm gonna stick to you like waffle syrup on a shag rug.</p>
<p>I'm gonna be on you like fish stink on a Gloucester dog.</p>
<p>I'm gonna be all over you like... where'd she go?</p>
<p>Okay, everybody! Dress rehearsal!</p>
<p>Hey, I'm still paying for that nose!</p>
<p>Lisa, the last time I checked, this was not Worldwide Wrestling.</p>
<p>And I checked five minutes ago.</p>
<p>Hey Lisa, come on over.</p>
<p>I can't... I promised I wouldn't.</p>
<p>If you don't breathe it, that smoke might go into a baby.</p>
<p>Well, since you cared enough to apply peer pressure...</p>
<p>There you go. Awesome. You go, girl.</p>
<p>Much better. That's it, yeah.</p>
<p>Yello.</p>
<p>She what?!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Well, I'm going to settle this once and for all!</p>
<p>Meet me at the place we discussed.</p>
<p>Who was that?</p>
<p>Wrong number.</p>
<p>Five min ladies.</p>
<p>Okay, Bart, it's time for Operation: Crazy-Plan.</p>
<p>Step one: we chuck the raccoon in there.</p>
<p>What if someone catches him?</p>
<p>Don't worry.</p>
<p>I have a perfect way to conceal his identity.</p>
<p>Okay, now go, boy!</p>
<p>Not keys, cigarettes!</p>
<p>Yeah, that's what I mean.</p>
<p>Okay, now we get rid of the cigarettes.</p>
<p>Lord, I could use a smoke.</p>
<p>Thank god.</p>
<p>Cigarette?</p>
<p>Can't. I'm pregnant.</p>
<p>Uh, one more favor?</p>
<p>Wow, what a great first act.</p>
<p>I hope Sleeping Beauty never wakes up.</p>
<p>Good, that's so hot. Good job. Great.</p>
<p>My cigarettes!</p>
<p>What happened to my cigarettes?!</p>
<p>Found one!</p>
<p>That's your finger!</p>
<p>I don't care!</p>
<p>Watch your hoof, you blue-ribbon sow.</p>
<p>I'll spit on your grave, grandma!</p>
<p>Oh, no! My appetite's coming back!</p>
<p>I haven't seen crap like this since my Broadway show: Crap Like This.</p>
<p>Ran for five years.</p>
<p>We can smoke the programs!</p>
<p>I can smoke my hair!</p>
<p>Maybe there's gum under the seats!</p>
<p>All right, that's enough!</p>
<p>I want to talk about a horrible practice afflicting millions of Americans.</p>
<p>For years we've known how dangerous it is.</p>
<p>It stunts your growth.</p>
<p>And it's marketed to children.</p>
<p>I'm talking about ballet.</p>
<p>I'll smoke to that!</p>
<p>Ballet is unnatural and unfair to women.</p>
<p>I shall now cast off the shoes of oppression!</p>
<p>You'll never take down big ballet!</p>
<p>Never! Now good day!</p>
<p>This is my favorite family tradition... ice cream after a botched recital.</p>
<p>And I'm happy to be smoke-free, thanks to these children's nicotine patches.</p>
<p>And I realize it's wrong to try to live your career dreams through your children.</p>
<p>Does that mean I can stop training to be a Mexican wrestler?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Now practice preening to the crowd, El Guapo.</p>
<p>Come on, preen harder!</p>
<p>Make them hate you!</p>
<p>You feed on their hatred and you are so hungry!</p>
<p>No me gusta.</p>
