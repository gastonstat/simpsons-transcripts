							<p>Hear about Miss Hoover? She drank some drain cleaner.</p>
<p>I heard she fell down a well.</p>
<p>Come on, now.</p>
<p>She's been dumped again.</p>
<p>I won't be staying long. I just learned I have Lyme disease.</p>
<p>Principal Skinner will stay until a sub comes.</p>
<p>What's Lyme disease?</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Lyme disease is spread by ticks.</p>
<p>When a tick begins to suck your bl*od... spirochetes infest your bl*od and spinal fluid and then the brain.</p>
<p>The brain. Oh, dear God!</p>
<p>Come on, Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Well, now, children, here we are.</p>
<p>Open your primers to page 32. Ah, subtraction!</p>
<p>Bart Simpson, I know it's you!</p>
<p>And here comes Snowball II. We kept this one.</p>
<p>The mother ate the gray one.</p>
<p>Mrs. Krabappel, he's traumatizing us.</p>
<p>I agree. Bart, shut that off and sit down.</p>
<p>Look, this is cool. When I hit reverse, I can make them go back in.</p>
<p>No, you're not seeing things. This, my little friends, is a schwa.</p>
<p>Are you the substitute?</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>Are you insane?</p>
<p>It's how I get their attention.</p>
<p>All right. Play friendly with your new teacher, children.</p>
<p>Howdy. I'm a Texas cowboy from 1830.</p>
<p>Ask me anything you like.</p>
<p>Can we play kickball?</p>
<p>Kickball? There ain't no kickball in 1830. Any other questions?</p>
<p>sh**t! It's awfully quiet.</p>
<p>Well, how about this? I want to see both eyes up here.</p>
<p>There are three things wrong with my costume. Name them... and you get my hat.</p>
<p>I know the answer.</p>
<p>What's your name?</p>
<p>Lisa Simpson.</p>
<p>Well, go ahead.</p>
<p>Your belt says &quot;State of Texas,&quot; but it wasn't a state until 1845.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>The revolver wasn't around till 1835.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>You seem to be Jewish.</p>
<p>You sure?</p>
<p>Italian?</p>
<p>Jewish.</p>
<p>Cowboys aren't Jewish.</p>
<p>Good! I also have a digital watch, but I'll accept that.</p>
<p>For the record, there were some Jewish cowboys.</p>
<p>Big guys who spent money freely.</p>
<p>I'm Mr. Bergstrom. You can make fun of my name.</p>
<p>Two suggestions are Mr. Nerd-strom and Mr. Booger-strom.</p>
<p>Today we will begin selecting a class president.</p>
<p>I can't vote, but I suggest Martin. Martin?</p>
<p>As president, I would demand a science fiction library... featuring an ABC of the overlords of the genre: -Asimov, Bester, Clarke--</p>
<p>What about Bradbury?</p>
<p>I'm aware of his work. Thank you, and keep watching the skies.</p>
<p>Excellent! Excellent, Martin!</p>
<p>If you're through with your pemmican, why don't we sing a song?</p>
<p>This one's not very accurate, but we'll fix it. Okay?</p>
<p>Actually, the range was far from home.</p>
<p>It was a desolate place of danger and disease.</p>
<p>Unlike the efficient lndians... cowboys used only the tongue of the antelope.</p>
<p>What's this? Did you do it?</p>
<p>No! I would never do anything like that.</p>
<p>It was one of those immature--</p>
<p>Can I have it?</p>
<p>Yes, but I didn't do it.</p>
<p>Are you sure you didn't? It's good.</p>
<p>I wish I had.</p>
<p>Class, &quot;The Singing Dork.&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa!</p>
<p>Any more nominations?</p>
<p>We nominate Bart Simpson! Speech!</p>
<p>I had a speech, but my dog ate it.</p>
<p>Children! Bart, I need someone to deliver a note to the principal.</p>
<p>Would you do it?</p>
<p>But where's the principal's office?</p>
<p>What did I say about encouraging him?</p>
<p>When Bart wins approval for being a fool--</p>
<p>Yay, Bart!</p>
<p>Bart! Bart! Bart!</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody, of the hundreds of people that visited the fair...&quot;</p>
<p>...knew that a gray spider had played the most important part of all.</p>
<p>&quot;No one was with her when she died.&quot;</p>
<p>Come on, everybody has a talent.</p>
<p>I wanna see yours.</p>
<p>I don't have one.</p>
<p>There has to be something you do better than anyone.</p>
<p>Well, I can do this.</p>
<p>Yes! Great!</p>
<p>How about you, Ralph?</p>
<p>Wonderful!</p>
<p>Chuck?</p>
<p>Disgusting. I love it!</p>
<p>Lisa, you're holding out. I see a saxophone!</p>
<p>I can't.</p>
<p>Come on. I bet you're good.</p>
<p>I can't.</p>
<p>Sure you can.</p>
<p>Please don't make me do it.</p>
<p>You owe me one.</p>
<p>While I'm technically married... it hasn't been much of a marriage since Mr. Krabappel moved out.</p>
<p>This profession can strain a marriage.</p>
<p>I've been looking for a substitute to teach me a lesson I sorely need.</p>
<p>Mrs. Krabappel, you're trying to seduce me.</p>
<p>Well?</p>
<p>I'm sorry. You're very nice, but it's the children I love.</p>
<p>Mr. Bergstrom is the first thing I think of when I wake up.</p>
<p>I feel that way about Homer.</p>
<p>You don't understand.</p>
<p>When he smiles, you see these teeth.</p>
<p>But when he laughs, you see these. The eyeteeth.</p>
<p>I don't know if he had braces, but they're perfect.</p>
<p>I notice little things about Homer.</p>
<p>Mom, this man makes you feel like there's nobody better.</p>
<p>So does Homer.</p>
<p>Mom, are we gonna talk or what?</p>
<p>You have to accept that I feel that way about your father.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Yesterday, he read us Charlotte's Web and cried at the end.</p>
<p>A book made him cry!</p>
<p>Nobody gets back in after lunch without one igneous rock... that's volcanic, and one sedimentary.</p>
<p>Lisa, can I see you?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>Your homework is always so neat. Does your father help you?</p>
<p>Homework's not his specialty.</p>
<p>It's okay. My dad could--</p>
<p>Not mine.</p>
<p>Let me finish.</p>
<p>Unless the next word was &quot;burp,&quot; don't bother.</p>
<p>In a sample taken in our classroom... an inspector found 1.74 parts per million of asbestos!</p>
<p>That's not enough! We demand more asbestos!</p>
<p>More asbestos! More asbestos!</p>
<p>More asbestos!</p>
<p>You made the front page.</p>
<p>It's just a popularity contest.</p>
<p>&quot;Just a popularity contest&quot;? What's more important than popularity?</p>
<p>Bart, can you really win?</p>
<p>Sure, why not?</p>
<p>I knew you had personality!</p>
<p>They said it was hyperactivity, but I knew better!</p>
<p>President Simpson. Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it, boy?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now, go get them!</p>
<p>He says, there are no easy answers! I say, he's not looking hard enough!</p>
<p>You never lose appealing to the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p>You'll miss Bart.</p>
<p>When?</p>
<p>When your life takes you places.</p>
<p>Places where my intelligence will be an asset?</p>
<p>Yes, there is such a place. Believe me.</p>
<p>I believe everything you say, with your words and Semitic good looks.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear Miss Hoover: You have Lyme disease. We miss you.</p>
<p>Kevin's biting me. Here's a drawing of a spirochete. Love, Ralph.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, that's great, Ralph!</p>
<p>The Springfield Museum of Natural History... will be closing down in two weeks.</p>
<p>Go see it while you can.</p>
<p>Lisa needs to go to the museum, and I think you should take her.</p>
<p>The museum?</p>
<p>Tomorrow? Oh, Marge, I'd love to, but I was planning on...</p>
<p>Sleeping? Eating a big sandwich? TV? Spending time with the boy!</p>
<p>...spending time with the boy.</p>
<p>I'm concerned about you and Lisa.</p>
<p>Me too. They're drifting apart.</p>
<p>Shut up, boy.</p>
<p>Homer, please.</p>
<p>You don't understand. I can't--</p>
<p>You're trapped. You're not smart enough to get out of this.</p>
<p>All right! I'll take her! Lousy brain.</p>
<p>What's a &quot;suggested donation&quot;?</p>
<p>Pay what you wish.</p>
<p>And what if I wish to pay zero?</p>
<p>It's up to you.</p>
<p>So it's up to me, is it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And you think that people are gonna pay you $4.50... when they don't have to, out of the goodness of their....</p>
<p>Anything you say! Good luck, lady! You'll need it!</p>
<p>Mr. Bergstrom!</p>
<p>Hi, Lisa.</p>
<p>Hey! You don't have to pay!</p>
<p>This must be your father.</p>
<p>His teeth were jagged, but he could swallow you whole.</p>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p>Actually, they do know a great deal about mummification.</p>
<p>First, they pulled the brain out and stuffed the skull with onions.</p>
<p>Gross!</p>
<p>Creepy. But I'd rather have him after me than the Wolf Man.</p>
<p>Oh, Lord.</p>
<p>I've noticed that Lisa seems to feel she has no strong male role model.</p>
<p>She said that?</p>
<p>No, but, you know, she--</p>
<p>But you can tell, right? She sees everybody else's dad... with a good education and says, &quot;What did I do to deserve this?&quot;</p>
<p>You must be a bigger man. There's a wonderful girl's future at stake. lf she's so great, give her an A.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>Great. Tell her she earned it.</p>
<p>She did earn it.</p>

<p>You are smooth. I'll give you that.</p>
<p>He ruined my chance to get to know Mr. Bergstrom outside school.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what, why don't we invite him to dinner?</p>
<p>Oh, Mom, that's wonderful!</p>
<p>Can I help cook?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Can I wear jewelry?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Dye my shoes? Paint my nails?</p>
<p>Can we have wine? Can I have wine?</p>
<p>Does Bart have to be there?</p>
<p>We request the pleasure of your company-- No.</p>
<p>If you're not doing anything this Friday-- No.</p>
<p>Mr. Bergstrom, do you like pork chops? Oh, no, of course not.</p>
<p>Good morning, Lisa. I'm back.</p>
<p>My Lyme disease turned out to be...</p>
<p>...psychosomatic.</p>
<p>Does that mean you're crazy?</p>
<p>It means she was faking.</p>
<p>It was a little of both.</p>
<p>Sometimes when a disease is on the news, it's natural to think you have it.</p>
<p>Where's Mr. Bergstrom?</p>
<p>Don't know.</p>
<p>But I'd like to talk to him. He didn't use my lesson plan.</p>
<p>What did he teach you?</p>
<p>That life is worth living.</p>
<p>The polls are open till the end of recess.</p>
<p>In case any of you have thought about this... we'll hear final statements. Martin?</p>
<p>I don't think there's anything left to say.</p>
<p>Bart?</p>
<p>Victory party under the slide!</p>
<p>Mr. Bergstrom! Mr. Bergstrom!</p>
<p>He moved out this morning. He took his Copernicus costume.</p>
<p>Where is he?</p>
<p>He's taking the train to Capital City.</p>
<p>The train. How like him. Traditional, yet environmentally sound.</p>
<p>Yes. And it's been the backbone of our country... since Stanford drove in that golden spike.</p>
<p>I see he touched you too.</p>
<p>Thanks for your vote.</p>
<p>Voting's for geeks!</p>
<p>You got that right.</p>
<p>Thanks for your vote.</p>
<p>We forgot.</p>
<p>Oh, well, as long as a couple of people did. Right, Milhouse?</p>
<p>Lewis?</p>
<p>Somebody must have voted.</p>
<p>What about you? Didn't you vote?</p>
<p>I demand a re-count.</p>
<p>Two for Martin. Want another re-count?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I want to make sure.</p>
<p>One for Martin, two for Martin.</p>
<p>This way, Mr. President!</p>
<p>Now boarding the Afternoon Delight....</p>
<p>Mr. Bergstrom!</p>
<p>Hey, Lisa.</p>
<p>Hey, Lisa, indeed!</p>
<p>What? What is it?</p>
<p>Were you just gonna leave, just like that?</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Lisa.</p>
<p>It's the life of the substitute teacher. He's a fraud.</p>
<p>Today he wears gym shorts, tomorrow he speaks French... or runs a band saw or God knows what.</p>
<p>You're the best teacher I'll ever have.</p>
<p>That's not true. Others will come.</p>
<p>Oh, please!</p>
<p>You're right, I'm the best. But they need me over in Capital City.</p>
<p>But I need you too.</p>
<p>When you're middle-class... anybody who cares will leave to help someone needier.</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>Mr. Bergstrom, I'm gonna miss you.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what. Whenever you feel alone... like there's no one you can rely on... this is all you need to know.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Bergstrom.</p>
<p>All aboard!</p>
<p>So, I guess this is it.</p>
<p>If you don't mind, I'll run alongside the train... as it speeds you from my life.</p>
<p>Goodbye, Lisa, honey!</p>
<p>It'll be okay. Just read the note!</p>
<p>Bart didn't get one vote?</p>
<p>This is the worst thing that could happen!</p>
<p>All right, spilled milk. What are you so mopey about?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Lisa, tell your father.</p>
<p>Mr. Bergstrom left.</p>
<p>Oh?</p>
<p>He's gone. Forever.</p>
<p>And?</p>
<p>I didn't think you'd understand.</p>
<p>Just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand.</p>
<p>I'm glad I'm not crying.</p>
<p>I'd hate for you to think that what I'm gonna say is based on emotion.</p>
<p>But you, sir, are a baboon!</p>
<p>Me?</p>
<p>Yes, you! Baboon! Baboon! Baboon!</p>
<p>You don't realize what you're saying.</p>
<p>Baboon!</p>
<p>Someone was bound to say it, but I never expected her.</p>
<p>Did you hear that? She called me a baboon!</p>
<p>The stupidest and ugliest ape of all!</p>
<p>You're not allowed to be hurt now.</p>
<p>A little girl needs you.</p>
<p>Her confidence in you is shaken... and no little girl can be happy without faith in her daddy.</p>
<p>&quot;Go away.&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa, don't hold anything back. You can tell me.</p>
<p>You're sad you called me a baboon?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Nuts.</p>
<p>This isn't going well at all. lf you want me to forgive--</p>
<p>No, I just wish I knew what to say.</p>
<p>But maybe this music will help.</p>
<p>Now, you lost someone special and it hurt.</p>
<p>I never lost anyone special to me.</p>
<p>Everyone special to me is under this roof.</p>
<p>It's true. Now, you'll have lots of special people in your life.</p>
<p>There's probably a place they hang out... and the food is good, and guys like me are serving drinks.</p>
<p>Maybe I can't explain all this, but I can fix your dollhouse.</p>
<p>At least I'm good at monkey work.</p>
<p>You know, monkey? You know what I mean?</p>
<p>I can hold these nails in place with my tail.</p>
<p>You're so silly.</p>
<p>Give me a banana.</p>
<p>I don't have any.</p>
<p>You're holding out on me.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I called you a baboon.</p>
<p>Think nothing of it.</p>
<p>President Prince, President Princess, President Priss....</p>
<p>Hey, what's the matter, son?</p>
<p>Oh, Dad. If just me, Milhouse and Lewis had voted.</p>
<p>Would you have gotten any money for being class president?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Would you have more work?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is Martin gonna get to do anything neat... like play in the World Series?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So, let the baby have his bottle.</p>
<p>That's my motto.</p>
<p>Hey, thanks, monkey-man.</p>
<p>Holy moly, talk about parenting.</p>
<p>Sleep well, Maggie. Three for three.</p>
<p>Did you straighten everything--?</p>
<p>Don't say anything, Marge.</p>
<p>Let's just go to bed. I'm on the biggest roll of my life.</p>
