<p>Brake My Wife, Please.</p>
<p>D'oh! Ah!</p>
<p>Okay, kids, stay together.</p>
<p>I appreciate you helping us out with this field trip.</p>
<p>Oh, a mom's work is never done.</p>
<p>Hmm, I thought I was being kicked exceptionally hard lately.</p>
<p>If I could be any type of shark, I'd be a tiger shark.</p>
<p>How about you, Milhouse?</p>
<p>I guess a nurse shark.</p>
<p>I mean... Oh! Ow, ow!</p>
<p>[ROARS]</p>
<p>Well, looks like Mr. Walrus and his family... are enjoying their Sunday brunch.</p>
<p>[ALL LAUGHING]</p>
<p>Shut up. What am I, some sort of joke to you people?</p>
<p>Now, over here is our newest exhibit, Wonders of the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Ooh!</p>
<p>Shut up. It's not that exciting.</p>
<p>The gulf is home to a breathtaking array of sea life.</p>
<p>But oil spills are threatening its delicate ecosystem.</p>
<p>[ALL GASPING]</p>
<p>Hey, without oil, you wouldn't have your fancy four-wheel drives.</p>
<p>You want to go back to two-wheel drive?</p>
<p>Well, do you?</p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]</p>
<p>I didn't mean to steal focus.</p>
<p><strong>Man (on monitor)</strong>: <em>Antarctic life is a constant struggle.</p>
<p>These sea lions survive by eating the leftovers... of the various film crews that plague the continent.</em></p>
<p>[GROANS]</p>
<p>Hmm...</p>
<p>[BLEATING]</p>
<p>[GASPS]</p>
<p>This t*nk is for our Pacific Habitat, which is currently being remodeled.</p>
<p>Where do you keep the fish till it's done?</p>
<p>Oh, they're well taken care of in our storage facility.</p>
<p>In this t*nk... we see some of the most exotic species of the coral reef.</p>
<p>Look, that giant clam appears to be opening.</p>
<p>This could be a wonderful journal entry.</p>
<p>[CHILDREN GASPING]</p>
<p>Look at the size of those flawless pearls.</p>
<p>[HUMMING]</p>
<p>[CHILDREN LAUGHING]</p>
<p>Oh, I might have known. But I didn't.</p>
<p>Bart, get out of there.</p>
<p>[BART GRUNTING]</p>
<p>My boy. Will he be all right?</p>
<p>This kind of injury is routine.</p>
<p>[HIBBERT CHUCKLING]</p>
<p>Bart will be up and underachieving in no time.</p>
<p>All I need is your insurance card.</p>
<p>Hmm, my husband has our card.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>Now, you stay shackled to that radiator until you come up with some insurance.</p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]</p>
<p>Well, it's 11 a.m. on a workday, so he must be at that stupid bar.</p>
<p>[PHONE DIALING]</p>
<p>Is my husband there?</p>
<p>I don't think he's here. Uh, hang on. Let me check.</p>
<p>[GRUNTS]</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>What you wearing?</p>
<p>[LINE DISCONNECTS]</p>
<p>[SIGHS]</p>
<p>Okay, five more minutes and I'm chewing my hand off.</p>
<p>Bart, are you okay?</p>
<p>Oh, Homie, where have you been?</p>
<p>I've been calling all over for you.</p>
<p>Hey, take it easy.</p>
<p>I went to the video store to rent a movie for the family.</p>
<p>[HOMER HUMMING]</p>
<p><strong>Man (on tv)</strong>: <em>He's got a nose for news... </em> HOMER: <em>Hmm.</p>
<p>...and a diaper full of headlines.</p>
<p>Hey, chief.</em></p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: <em>He's editor-in-chimp.</em></p>
<p>[LAUGHING]</p>
<p>That monkey's wearing a hat.</p>
<p>WOMAN[ON TV]: <em>Lifetime Films presents</em> Buttercups of Autumn.</p>
<p>I fear I have become a buttercup of winter.</p>
<p>Hush up, Nana. That's fool talk.[/i]</p>
<p>[SOBBING]</p>
<p>[MONKEY GIBBERING]</p>
<p>[LAUGHING]</p>
<p>[SOBBING] Nana, she's so wise... but no one's gonna benefit from her wisdom.</p>
<p>[MONKEY GIBBERS AND HOMER LAUGHS]</p>
<p>Look, he's misspelling words.</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: <em>Nana.</em></p>
<p>[SOBBING] Oh, she's so...</p>
<p>Well, from now on, you need to get a cell phone so I can reach you.</p>
<p>You just can't get a cell phone.</p>
<p>Lindsay Naegle, Veriqual Cellular.</p>
<p>And I can offer you a whole range of cellular solutions.</p>
<p>Can I get a phone that plays the Mexican hat dance?</p>
<p>I insist on it.</p>
<p>[MEXICAN RINGTONE PLAYING OVER PHONE]</p>
<p>[SINGING] <em>I dance, I dance, I dance.</p>
<p>Around the Mexican hat.</p>
<p>I dance, I dance, I dance And that's the end of that.</p>
<p>Or is it? I guess I'll keep singing My cell phone appears to be ringing</em></p>
<p>[CAR HORN HONKS]</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p>Barney, you ever notice how hard it is to drive with your knees?</p>
<p>Why don't get one of those hands-free phones?</p>
<p>It's the next best thing to paying attention to the road.</p>
<p>Hands-free, eh?</p>
<p>Then I could give the brothers the black-power salute.</p>
<p>Black power, black power.</p>
<p>Was that Al Roker?</p>
<p>His exuberance is perplexing.</p>
<p>We have headsets, but you'd be mad to stop there.</p>
<p>Tell me, what is currently plugged into your car's cigarette lighter?</p>
<p>Uh, a lighter.</p>
<p>I weep for you.</p>
<p>These days, everything from fax machines to coffeemakers... can be plugged into your dash hole.</p>
<p>I'll take them.</p>
<p>DVD player, check.</p>
<p>Snow-cone machine, check.</p>
<p>Lite-Brite, check.</p>
<p>Fog machine...</p>
<p>Even I think this is crazy.</p>
<p>[SCRATCHES]</p>
<p>[RAPPING] <em>Chaka Khan, let me rock you.</p>
<p>Let me rock you Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan.</p>
<p>Whisk the egg whites into the batter mixture... while scraping the edges with a very stiff rubber spatula.</p>
<p>Now let's look in on our hush puppies.</em></p>
<p>[HOMER HUMMING]</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>[GRUNTING]</p>
<p>[GASPS]</p>
<p>Oh, my God. I gotta do something.</p>
<p>[BEEPING]</p>
<p>Come on, transmit.</p>
<p>Transmit.</p>
<p>Save me, Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan!</p>
<p>[SPUTTERS THEN COUGHS]</p>
<p>Oh, I'll never mock the Coast Guard again.</p>
<p>You Navy rejects are all right.</p>
<p>Mr. Simpson, give me your license.</p>
<p>[GROANS]</p>
<p>[DOGS GROWLING]</p>
<p>Burn their poop.</p>
<p>I am so screwed.</p>
<p>I can't drive to work. I can't drive to the store.</p>
<p>And I certainly can't drive to the store at work.</p>
<p>[SIGHS]</p>
<p>I guess I'll have to do all your driving chores.</p>
<p>That's what a good wife does, picks up the slack.</p>
<p>That reminds me. We gotta pick up my slacks at that dry cleaner in Shelbyville.</p>
<p>Why can't you use the local dry cleaner?</p>
<p>Uh, I didn't want him to know my size.</p>
<p>[GROANS]</p>
<p>Thanks for picking my friends up from the strip club, Marge.</p>
<p>Can we stop for ice cream?</p>
<p>Homer always stops for ice cream.</p>
<p>We'll see.</p>
<p>That always means no.</p>
<p>[GROANS]</p>
<p>Where's your mother? I gotta get to Moe's.</p>
<p>Dad, Mom's been driving everyone everywhere.</p>
<p>Why don't you take public transportation?</p>
<p>Public transportation is for jerks and lesbians.</p>
<p>Oh, I guess I'll walk.</p>
<p>Stupid walking.</p>
<p>Thighs chafing horribly.</p>
<p>No drink holder.</p>
<p>I miss my car so much.</p>
<p>Everyone's driving but me.</p>
<p>I can't drive 55 because it only goes 38.</p>
<p>I let go of the parking brake.</p>
<p>[PANTING] Ralphie, if you stop... I'll let you play with my g*n.</p>
<p>[HUMMING]</p>
<p>I did it.</p>
<p>I walked all the way to Moe's from my house.</p>
<p><strong>Bart</strong>: Way to go, Dad.</p>
<p>You know, I feel pretty good.</p>
<p>Maybe I should just keep walking instead of going into a dark, dreary bar.</p>
<p>Get in here, boozy. You're late for your drunkening.</p>
<p>No. From now on, walking is my beer and feeling good is my hangover.</p>
<p>Hmph.</p>
<p>Huh. Hey, maybe this is a sign.</p>
<p>Maybe it's time to get out of the alcohol business... give barber college another try.</p>
<p>And this time, I won't join a frat.</p>
<p>Who the hell am I talking to?</p>
<p>You know, all this walking is paying off.</p>
<p>Look how healthy I am.</p>
<p>You see? I'm finally thin enough to wrap this thing around my arm.</p>
<p>Good for you, Dad. Could you get me some syrup?</p>
<p>Mm, mm.</p>
<p>You see? Before I probably would've driven to the syrup.</p>
<p>Kids, hurry up and eat. We have to leave for the dentist five minutes ago.</p>
<p>[BART GRUNTING]</p>
<p>We don't have time for choking.</p>
<p>Calm down, Stresserella.</p>
<p>Unh, I'm stressed because now that you've lost your license... I'm a full-time family chauffeur.</p>
<p>Now, now, honey, we all appreciate what you do.</p>
<p>But real chauffeurs have uniforms and licenses.</p>
<p>You could get in a lot of trouble with the Livery Commission.</p>
<p>To hell with the Livery Commission.</p>
<p>You don't know what you're saying.</p>
<p>What a day for a stroll.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: What are you doing...?</p>

<p>[CHATTERING]</p>
<p>Seymour, the two of us could make good use of this time.</p>
<p>Indeed. You take this teacher-evaluation test.</p>
<p>I'll proctor. Read the directions silently as I read them aloud to you.</p>
<p>Look at those suckers in their metal coffins.</p>
<p>I can go to work any way I want.</p>
<p>[WHISTLES]</p>
<p>Psst. Bishop to queen four.</p>
<p>We're playing dominoes.</p>
<p>I said bishop to queen four.</p>
<p>All right, all right, you.</p>
<p>[WHISTLING]</p>
<p>[GRUNTS]</p>
<p>Simpson, you're a menace.</p>
<p>Oh, George, leave the boy be.</p>
<p>Martha, I want a divorce.</p>
<p>Oh, George, you've made me so happy.</p>
<p>[HOMER HUMS]</p>
<p>You're the first one here. Please accept this free ticket to the 1939 World's Fair.</p>
<p>Thanks, Mr. Burns.</p>
<p>I owe it all to walking.</p>
<p>Walking, eh? Let me give it a try.</p>
<p>[GRUNTS]</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>Huh!</p>
<p>Well, I'd better drag myself to the hospital.</p>
<p>[GRUNTING]</p>
<p>Oh, dear.</p>
<p>Smithers, scoop me up.</p>
<p>How could you both miss the bus to school?</p>
<p>We touched hands. Then we had to wash the cooties off.</p>
<p>[GROANS]</p>
<p>[RUSTLES]</p>
<p>What's all that rustling?</p>
<p>My show-and-tell project.</p>
<p>A Peruvian fighting frog.</p>
<p>Hey, I brought a Peruvian fighting frog.</p>
<p>[BOTH CROAKING]</p>
<p>[GRUNTING]</p>
<p>When will they stop?</p>
<p>Come nightfall.</p>
<p>How about we take a family walk around the block?</p>
<p>Yay! I wanna amble.</p>
<p>I wanna saunter.</p>
<p>Amble.</p>
<p>Saunter.</p>
<p>Amble.</p>
<p>Saunter.</p>
<p>Stop saying things.</p>
<p>Honey, you seem frazzled. Why don't you come with us?</p>
<p>Hey, I'd like that.</p>
<p>Oh, I can't. I have to go pick up Grampa.</p>
<p>He proposed to another hooker at the bus station.</p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]</p>
<p>You sure love driving.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>[HUMMING]</p>
<p>Morning, Homer. Looking good.</p>
<p>Walking has made a new man out of you.</p>
<p>It sure has. You see this bulge back here?</p>
<p>Now it actually is a fanny pack.</p>
<p>Unh, no, wait. It's still my ass.</p>
<p>But your point is well taken.</p>
<p>You see...</p>
<p>[SINGING] <em>I like to walk down the avenue.</p>
<p>Bust a move with Disco Stu.</p>
<p>You shake me from my booty To my 'fro.</p>
<p>Yes, I strut down the boulevard Burning off my excess lard.</p>
<p>I rarely feel the need to utter &quot;d'oh&quot;</em></p>
<p>Top of the morning, ladies.</p>
<p>Bite us.</p>
<p><em>I can walk from Springfield to Alaska.</p>
<p>Then hobnob with the stars in Malibu</em></p>
<p>Hi, Homer. I'm actor Steve Buscemi.</p>
<p>The guy who got fed into the wood chipper in <em>Fargo?</p>
<p>And when I hear...</em></p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>: <em>You can't walk to Turkmenistan.</p>
<p>I say, of course, I can Screw you</em></p>
<p>Hey, would you guys like tickets to the lndependent Film Awards?</p>
<p>[IN UNISON] Would we?</p>
<p><em>Oh, I love to perambulate it's standing still I really hate.</p>
<p>So let me please reiterate, I love to...</em></p>
<p>[TIRES SQUEAL THEN HOMER SCREAMS]</p>
<p>[GASPS]</p>
<p>Oh, my feet are inside me.</p>
<p>I am so sorry, Homie.</p>
<p>How is your crushed pelvis?</p>
<p>Pretty good. Thanks for asking.</p>
<p>I don't know what happened. I saw you and I went for the brake... but I hit the accelerator.</p>
<p>It's okay, Marge.</p>
<p>It would've been worse if I hadn't been carrying this Bible in my crotch.</p>
<p>Marge, while Homer recuperates... I'm afraid you'll have to do everything for him.</p>
<p>That's okay.</p>
<p>I can handle it.</p>
<p>Homie, why don't you just relax and have a little soup?</p>
<p>Aah! Too hot. Too hot.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Aah! Hot. Hot. Hot.</p>
<p>Warm. Tepid. Cool.</p>
<p>Cold. Cold. So cold.</p>
<p>Oh, you're really coming along, Homie.</p>
<p>Yeah. The doctor says that soon my pelvis... will actually be stronger and more beautiful than ever.</p>
<p>Gee, everything always works out for you.</p>
<p>[HOMER GRUNTS]</p>
<p>Aah! Oh, my God. Let me help you up.</p>
<p>Marge, you're trying to hurt me.</p>
<p>What? That's crazy.</p>
<p>No, it's true. The car, the soup.</p>
<p>It's like you hate me, your own husband.</p>
<p>That's ridiculous. I don't like you.</p>
<p>I mean hate you, hate you, hate you.</p>
<p>I hate you!</p>
<p>I've heard that from coworkers, strangers on the street... even my own children.</p>
<p>But I never thought I'd hear it from you.</p>
<p>Maybe we should see a counselor.</p>
<p>Who's we? Got a mouse in your purse?</p>
<p>Manjula, I'm so glad you have finally forgiven me for having an affair.</p>
<p>[GRUNTS]</p>
<p>She used to elbow me in the face.</p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]</p>
<p>Next, please.</p>
<p>I've been married to my husband for 10 years... and part of me wants to k*ll him.</p>
<p>Perhaps you feel that your husband sees you as less of a partner... and more of a doormat?</p>
<p>Nothing could be further from the...</p>
<p>You could be onto something there.</p>
<p>[HOMER DROOLING]</p>
<p>What? Oh, sorry, I got a lot on my mind.</p>
<p>That's okay. Take your time.</p>
<p>All right, before you came in, I asked you each... to make a list of the people that are most important to you.</p>
<p>Homer, you first.</p>
<p>There's Homer... Homer J. Simpson, and Commander Cool, a.k.a. me.</p>
<p>That's us in a nutshell.</p>
<p>I care so much about you, Homer.</p>
<p>But I'm not even on your list.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>We gotta help her.</p>
<p>If Marge isn't happy, I'm not happy.</p>
<p>And if I'm not happy, Moe is very happy.</p>
<p>But for once, this isn't about Moe.</p>
<p>What should I do, Dr. Hotdog?</p>
<p>All right, I have an answer.</p>
<p>You must perform for her one completely unselfish gesture.</p>
<p>You mean, like give her full custody of the kids?</p>
<p>Yeah, full custody. That's exactly what I...</p>
<p>You're an idiot.</p>
<p>Unh.</p>
<p>You gotta knock her off her feet with something utterly romantic.</p>
<p>Something that says, &quot;I care about you.&quot;</p>
<p>I see. Do you have any suggestions?</p>
<p>I do. But the hour's over.</p>
<p>Here's a dollar.</p>
<p>Romantic dinner.</p>
<p>Gotta go.</p>
<p>You know what Mom really loves? Julienne potatoes.</p>
<p>And for dessert, peach crumble.</p>
<p>You wanna know how to make a peach crumble? Kick it in the groin. Ha!</p>
<p>Anyway, what's going on?</p>
<p>I'm gonna treat Marge to a romantic dinner... to make up for all my shortcomings.</p>
<p>Hey, Homer, if you're having a banquet for Marge, I'd like to help.</p>
<p>Hey, me too. I can whip up my famous... poulet au vin avec champignons à la Carl. Mwah.</p>
<p>You can bring a bag of ice.</p>
<p>Lousy Homer. I'll show him.</p>
<p>Tonight, his beloved mock apple pie will have real apples.</p>
<p>Wha...?</p>
<p>[GASPS]</p>
<p>Oh, my God. It's so beautiful.</p>
<p>Hey, look, everybody, Marge is here.</p>
<p>[ALL CHEERING]</p>
<p>Oh, Homie.</p>
<p>You got everyone in Springfield here for me.</p>
<p>Honey, I couldn't keep them away if I tried, except for Flanders.</p>
<p>He was mysteriously called out of town.</p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]</p>
<p>I got your letter. I'm coming as fast as I can.</p>
<p>Tonight, we're here to serve you.</p>
<p>Sit back and enjoy the finest foods Springfield has to offer.</p>
<p>I brought you me finest catch of the day.</p>
<p>We lost a dozen good men.</p>
<p>But it's worth it just to see ye smile.</p>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p>That's it, eh?</p>
<p>Twelve men.</p>
<p>Well, I've got some families to inform.</p>
<p>Unbelievable...</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Nothing. Just a curse on your very soul.</p>
<p>Marge, I bring you the main course.</p>
<p>Elektra recording artist- slash-political activist... Jackson Browne.</p>
<p>Oh, the Pretender.</p>
<p>When Homer told me about this special night, I just had to be a part of it.</p>
<p>I'm here to serenade you with a song.</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Yay!</p>
<p>From my latest album.</p>
<p><strong>Skinner</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>Just kidding. Here's one of my many classics.</p>
<p>That I fixed with new words.</p>
<p>[PLAYING PIANO]</p>
<p>[SINGING] <em>You hooked up in high school.</p>
<p>Now you've come so far.</p>
<p>Then you started to hate him And hit him with your car.</p>
<p>So I threw you a fancy banquet.</p>
<p>And now you can't stay mad.</p>
<p>How about a make-up snuggle?</p>
<p>It would be so rad</em></p>
<p>Oh, I'm really touched by how much you care.</p>
<p>I love you too.</p>
<p>So, uh, you don't wanna k*ll me anymore?</p>
<p>Only with kisses.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, don't be a wuss.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson (singing)</strong>: <em>When you turn out the light.</p>
<p>I've got to hand it to me.</p>
<p>It looks like it's me and you again tonight Marjorie</em></p>
<p>[CROWD CHATTERING]</p>
<p>[BAND PLAYING SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]</p>
<p>[HOMER CLEARS THROAT]</p>
<p>Now I'd like to propose a toast to a woman who's done so much for us... without getting anything in return.</p>
<p>Except a place to live and free food.</p>
<p>Why, you little...</p>
<p>[BOTH GRUNT]</p>
<p>Now let's all raise our wine boxes...</p>
<p>[BOTH GRUNT]</p>
<p>...to Marge.</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Hear, hear! To Marge!</p>
<p>Unh, I'm so full, my control-top panel is in shards.</p>
<p>[SIGHS]</p>
<p>I wanna thank you all so much.</p>
<p>You're welcome. And now, Marge, we cooked, you clean.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Ha, ha, only teasing.</p>
<p>We've flown in the finest busboys from France... Uh, I mean, America.</p>
<p>[ALL SPEAKING IN FRENCH THEN LAUGHING]</p>
<p>And now to all my dear friends, I say, get the hell out of my yard.</p>
<p>[CROWD GRUNTING AND CHATTERING]</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Shh.</p>
