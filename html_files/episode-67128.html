Pick up the pace.  </p>
<p>Here you go.  </p>
<p>Mm...  </p>
<p>Mmm.  </p>
<p>Hurry up! It's almost here.  </p>
<p>Mm?  </p>
<p>Yippee!  </p>
<p>My industrial-grade steam vacuum.  </p>
<p>The same model they use to clean   </p>
<p>grisly crime scenes and<br />
sticky champagne rooms.   </p>
<p>Okay, ma'am,<br />
I have you down for a three-hour rental   </p>
<p>starting... now.   </p>
<p>Everybody, out, out, out, out, out!   </p>
<p>Me and the floors deserve<br />
to savor every minute   </p>
<p>of our special spa day.   </p>
<p>And take the dog.   </p>
<p>Now it's my time   </p>
<p>to make these stains &quot;herstory.&quot;   </p>
<p>Ugh, are you quoting<br />
their actual slogan?   </p>
<p>I'm quoting my wildest dreams.   </p>
<p>- Dog park, dog park, dog park!<br />
- Whee!   </p>
<p>Whee! Whee!   </p>
<p>Trampoline park, trampoline park,   </p>
<p>trampoline park!   </p>
<p>Aw, don't leave me alone<br />
in that giant dirt toilet   </p>
<p>with all those lonely<br />
dog-obsessed weirdos.   </p>
<p>Please.   </p>
<p>Well, what could go wrong<br />
with all those doctors around?   </p>
<p>- Hey, Homer.<br />
- What are you doing here?   </p>
<p>Once it became clear<br />
that human companionship   </p>
<p>was a non-starter,   </p>
<p>I adopted this handsome<br />
little mister, Devin.   </p>
<p>He loves it here.   </p>
<p>The training books say it's important   </p>
<p>to keep your dog socialized.   </p>
<p>It's not a book park.   </p>
<p>And now that you're here,<br />
I have somebody   </p>
<p>I can talk dogs with.   </p>
<p>So, where'd you get your dog?   </p>
<p>Uh, I think he came with the house?   </p>
<p>Look at us, dog-talking.   </p>
<p>We'll meet here every morning<br />
at  :   and have our own club.   </p>
<p>The Dog Dad Boyz.   </p>
<p>I'll reach out to logo designers.   </p>
<p><em>Oh, God,<br />
somebody get me out of this.</em>   </p>
<p>Aah! Dev-Dev!   </p>
<p>Control your psycho, maniac.   </p>
<p>Bad dog dad.   </p>
<p>Membership in the Dog Dad Boyz revoked.   </p>
<p>Oh, you saved me from the<br />
worst kind of human...   </p>
<p>a dog lover.   </p>
<p>I love you, dog.   </p>
<p>Let's go get you a reward.   </p>
<p>Okay, wait here for two<br />
minutes while I get your treat.   </p>
<p>I'm gonna open the windows halfway   </p>
<p>and leave the AC running.   </p>
<p>Hmm.   </p>
<p>What ice cream flavor<br />
will make my dog feel   </p>
<p>like the most cherished<br />
creature in the entire universe?   </p>
<p>Hey, check it out.   </p>
<p>Some jerk left their dog in the car.   </p>
<p>With the windows rolled up, no less.   </p>
<p>- Who does that?<br />
- Monster.   </p>
<p>Obviously, no chocolate,<br />
but he does love peanut butter.   </p>
<p>Rum raisin is a no, for any species.   </p>
<p>What kind of lunatic<br />
thinks this is okay?   </p>
<p>Some people are just born broken.   </p>
<p>Puppy spoiler, coming through.   </p>
<p>Hey, what am I missing?   </p>
<p>A churlish individual saw fit   </p>
<p>to desert their dog in a hideous sedan.   </p>
<p>Wait, it's not what it looks like.   </p>
<p>I just left my dog in my car on purpose.   </p>
<p>Whoa, how could you, man?   </p>
<p>And on a scorcher like today?   </p>
<p>What? It's not a...   </p>
<p>Aah! Come on boy, help me out.   </p>
<p>Get the keys. Get the keys.   </p>
<p>You expect him to work<br />
under these conditions?   </p>
<p>No, wait. I think Marge   </p>
<p>hid a key under the car somewhere.   </p>
<p>The dog-cooking wuss is trying to hide.   </p>
<p>Grab his legs!   </p>
<p>Leave me alone. I'm good with dogs.   </p>
<p>He locked the Dalmatian<br />
in the firetruck. Oh!   </p>
<p>Gotta be kidding me!   </p>
<p>Okay, everyone. The dog's fine.   </p>
<p>Why don't you all just get a life.   </p>
<p>No wonder his dog is such a psycho.   </p>
<p>He's probably a bad parent, too.   </p>
<p>How dare you?   </p>
<p>Dad, you forgot to pick us up.   </p>
<p>Glad that's over, aren't we, boy?   </p>
<p>Uh, I'm not so sure.   </p>
<p>Oh... yes.   </p>
<p>This must be<br />
how Catholics feel after confession.   </p>
<p>Now, to post some before-and-after shots   </p>
<p>so the neighbors can eat<br />
their dirty carpet hearts out.   </p>
<p>- Hmm?    </p>
<p>No.    </p>
<p>No. No...    </p>
<p>No!    </p>
<p>Okay, so far,<br />
the neighborhood rage is contained    </p>
<p>to just dog lovers.    </p>
<p>Oh, no. It's spread to the cat people.    </p>
<p>Oh, now it's the horse crazies.    </p>
<p>Those horse crazies don't mess around.    </p>
<p>Homer,<br />
you have to apologize for yesterday.    </p>
<p>What? Why? The dog and I are cool.    </p>
<p>Look, we know you didn't<br />
mean to do anything wrong.    </p>
<p>But sometimes you just need<br />
to accept responsibility    </p>
<p>so people will move on.    </p>
<p>So, I drafted you a heartfelt apology.    </p>
<p>That's so sweet, honey.    </p>
<p>But trust me, it'll blow over.    </p>
<p>When God gave man dominion over    </p>
<p>all the beasts of the Earth,    </p>
<p>that was not permission for one man    </p>
<p>to abandon a dog in a hot Plymouth.    </p>
<p>Mm. Okay, I get it.<br />
Everybody's mad at me.    </p>
<p>Dad, nip this in the bud    </p>
<p>and use my apology.    </p>
<p>I'm Homer Simpson,    </p>
<p>and I'm truly sorry.    </p>
<p>Tsk, tsk, tsk!    </p>
<p>Sorry if you pee-pee babies<br />
were offended by something    </p>
<p>that was no big deal<br />
and everything's fine.    </p>
<p>So what's the issue?    </p>
<p>Amazing job,<br />
you really got his voice down.    </p>
<p>Okay, Homer,<br />
I think you've made your point.    </p>
<p>I'm sorry that you don't have<br />
enough things to get mad at.    </p>
<p>I'm sorry that you all have skin    </p>
<p>thinner than gas station toilet paper.    </p>
<p>And I'm sorry that your<br />
lives are so boring    </p>
<p>that you take a man<br />
who left his rescue dog    </p>
<p>for two minutes to buy<br />
him organic ice cream    </p>
<p>from a woman-owned local business,    </p>
<p>and you crucify him!    </p>
<p>Ahh!    </p>
<p>Ow, my dog's eye!    </p>
<p>Mm-mm.    </p>
<p>My fellow Springfielders,<br />
here at Burns Industries,    </p>
<p>we release the hounds<br />
on all forms of disrespect,    </p>
<p>and to tolerance we say, &quot;excellent.&quot;    </p>
<p>As such, we have terminated association    </p>
<p>with Homer J. Simpson, as his actions    </p>
<p>do not represent the<br />
values of Evil Corps.    </p>
<p><em>Moving forward, we plan to sit back,</em>    </p>
<p><em>tent our fingers, and listen.</em>    </p>
<p>Well, Homer, on the plus side,<br />
this has made people forget    </p>
<p>- you almost k*ll the dog.<br />
- Oh...    </p>
<p>Yes, this is the residence    </p>
<p>of the guy who pushed a<br />
pastor out of a church window.    </p>
<p>Uh-huh. And would you classify<br />
that as a death threat    </p>
<p>or merely an act of extreme violence?    </p>
<p>Thank you for your rage.    </p>
<p>- Hm.<br />
- Oh, Lovejoy's fine.    </p>
<p>But I lost my job and now<br />
that trolls put my photos    </p>
<p>and phone number on the Internet,    </p>
<p>I also lost my anonon-nim-ninim-ninity.    </p>
<p>There's also a bunch of TikToks    </p>
<p>of people lip-syncing to what you said,    </p>
<p>because that's what comedy is now.    </p>
<p><em>I'm sorry that you all have skin</em>    </p>
<p><em>thinner than gas station toilet paper.</em>    </p>
<p>Oh, I've never been<br />
so viciously lampooned.    </p>
<p>I hate this horrible new world.    </p>
<p>What I need now is the<br />
comfort of fast food    </p>
<p>and slow friends.    </p>
<p>Three weeks later.    </p>
<p><em>Shrimp? Who you calling shrimp?</em>    </p>
<p><em>It's prawn time, baby,</em>    </p>
<p><em>at Dead Lobster's Annual Prawn-a-thon!</em>    </p>
<p><em>Grab your bib for crispy popcorn prawn,</em>    </p>
<p><em>wood-grilled prawn skewers<br />
sizzling prawn scampi,</em>    </p>
<p><em>and parmesan-breaded prawns casino</em>    </p>
<p><em>served over ice cold lump prawn.</em>    </p>
<p><em>All washed down with a tropical<br />
Tiki Passion Prawn-tini.</em>    </p>
<p>Guys! It's Prawn-a-thon time. Guys!    </p>
<p>They wouldn't go without me, would they?    </p>
<p>Oh my God, everybody, shut up.    </p>
<p>It's the pastor-pusher.    </p>
<p>Well, I never.    </p>
<p>Why am I always meeting people<br />
who never? Mm.    </p>
<p>Hey, &quot;strangers,&quot; enjoying<br />
your entrées of embarrassment    </p>
<p>about being related to me?    </p>
<p>Don't take it personally.    </p>
<p>We need to be able to do<br />
some normal family things    </p>
<p>without being publicly shamed.    </p>
<p>We just want a little<br />
anon-mini-nanom-nini-ninity.    </p>
<p>But Prawn-a-thon?    </p>
<p>That's our special thon.    </p>
<p>I'm so upset I might not ever be able    </p>
<p>to get my prawn on again.    </p>
<p>Yikes. That has got to<br />
be the saddest thing    </p>
<p>ever said in a chain seafood restaurant.    </p>
<p>It's not too late, Homer.    </p>
<p>I'm here to help you.    </p>
<p>Help me? Is this    </p>
<p>some kind of prank,<br />
like when those YouTubers    </p>
<p>chased me with real machetes?    </p>
<p>Wow. And no.    </p>
<p>I have created a refuge    </p>
<p>where people like you<br />
can find redemption.    </p>
<p>I run an institute.<br />
We call it The Institute.    </p>
<p>And it might just be your last chance    </p>
<p>at rehabilitating your reputation.    </p>
<p>Wait, wait,<br />
are you saying you can steam clean,    </p>
<p>if you will,    </p>
<p>my husband's reputational carpet,<br />
if you will?    </p>
<p>I am, and I will. And I will.    </p>
<p>The Institute is his only hope.    </p>
<p>Well, my reputation is everything to me.    </p>
<p>That doesn't jibe with<br />
your past behavior.    </p>
<p>I'm tired of reputations<br />
being about past behavior.    </p>
<p>I'll do it. Keep it safe.    </p>
<p>Here at the Institute,<br />
we break our rehabilitants up    </p>
<p>according to the severity<br />
of their mistakes.    </p>
<p>- Uh-huh. Yep.    </p>
<p>- That makes sense.    </p>
<p>- Interesting.    </p>
<p>We don't take any Halloween<br />
mishaps more recent than that    </p>
<p>because, at a certain point,<br />
you should know better.    </p>
<p>Totally.    </p>
<p>Homer, meet your team.    </p>
<p>Just like you, they all went<br />
stupid viral in a bad way.    </p>

<p>Hey! That was just a careless<br />
accident born out of rage.    </p>
<p>Are we sure we have the<br />
right people for this team?    </p>
<p><em>They're awful.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Which is why they're<br />
perfect for this mission.</em>    </p>
<p>Here at the Institute, we believe    </p>
<p>good works overcome bad days.    </p>
<p>So, to fix your reputations,    </p>
<p>your team will be doing<br />
public acts of charity.    </p>
<p>When we post them online,    </p>
<p>they will make your<br />
transgressions a distant memory.    </p>
<p>Work together?    </p>
<p>Sorry, I don't exactly<br />
play well with others.    </p>
<p>Okay, then we'll spend the day    </p>
<p>doing a bunch of team-building<br />
improv exercises.    </p>
<p>Good deeds! Good deeds!    </p>
<p>♪ <em>I'm a fool to do your dirty work</em> ♪    </p>
<p>♪ <em>Oh, yeah</em> ♪    </p>
<p>- ♪ <em>I don't wanna do</em> ♪    </p>
<p>♪ <em>Your dirty work</em> ♪    </p>
<p>- ♪ <em>No more</em> ♪</p>
<p>♪ <em>I'm a fool to do your dirty work</em> ♪    </p>
<p>- ♪ <em>Oh, yeah.</em> ♪</p>
<p>I can feel my reputation being restored    </p>
<p>with each carefully-staged good deed.    </p>
<p>Look, it's the people the<br />
Internet told us to hate.    </p>
<p>They still hate us.<br />
The plan isn't working.    </p>
<p>What do we do now? Call    ?    </p>
<p>Unfortunately, that was the only way    </p>
<p>to get you your lives back.    </p>
<p>Well, there is one other way.<br />
No, we can't.    </p>
<p>- What?<br />
- No, it's too radical.    </p>
<p>Ah, but it's the only thing<br />
that's    % guaranteed to work.    </p>
<p>Hmm, yeah, it does sound pretty radical.    </p>

<p><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div></p>
<p>Thanks for being honest about that.    </p>
<p>Well, sometimes<br />
the only way to get results    </p>
<p>is through radical action.    </p>
<p>Sorry, we took a vote. It's too radical.    </p>
<p>Wh...<br />
I didn't even tell you what it is yet.    </p>
<p>When you said &quot;radical,&quot;<br />
you said enough. Bye forever.    </p>
<p>Look, I thought that<br />
by calling it radical,    </p>
<p>you'd be more likely to want to do it.    </p>
<p>Like you'd be intrigued or something.    </p>
<p>Intrigued, eh?    </p>
<p>You are all here at The Institute...    </p>
<p>...because of the humiliation you faced    </p>
<p>after the world saw<br />
you on your worst day.    </p>
<p>But, what if you could delete all that    </p>
<p>from every computer,<br />
every phone, every meme,    </p>
<p>and even every personal<br />
hard drive on Earth?    </p>
<p>But that's impossible.    </p>
<p>You'd have to invent<br />
something to do that.    </p>
<p>Funny you say that. I did    </p>
<p>invent something to do that.    </p>
<p>A universal eradication code<br />
that can completely scrub    </p>
<p>any image or video<br />
from the entire Internet.    </p>
<p>Scrub us. You scrub us right now!    </p>
<p>Oh, I would, but first<br />
I need to upload the code    </p>
<p>into the one server powerful enough    </p>
<p>to reach every corner<br />
of the World Wide Web.    </p>
<p>ChumNet.    </p>
<p>You mean the company<br />
that puts those annoying    </p>
<p>clickbait-y headlines on<br />
the bottom of every website?    </p>
<p>Yes, they're everywhere.    </p>
<p>No platform has greater reach.    </p>
<p>But to upload the scrub<br />
code into their servers,    </p>
<p>I need you to break in to<br />
the ChumNet headquarters.    </p>
<p>Break in? That sounds dangerous.    </p>
<p>It is, Helen.    </p>
<p>That was the radical part<br />
I mentioned earlier,    </p>
<p>that didn't seem to<br />
land with any of you.    </p>
<p>Radical, eh?    </p>
<p>Yeah, we don't have anything to lose.    </p>
<p>So, we're kind of like a su1c1de squad.    </p>
<p>You're exactly kind of<br />
like a su1c1de squad.    </p>
<p>What do you say?    </p>
<p>I think we can pull this-o.    </p>
<p>I say we do it.    </p>
<p>We need to fight for each other,<br />
because we're a family.    </p>
<p>Aw.    </p>
<p>A family I don't want or need.    </p>
<p>I miss my actual family,<br />
so let's do this.    </p>
<p>But if we're going on<br />
a commando mission,    </p>
<p>don't we need some sort of training?    </p>
<p>Don't you see?    </p>
<p>You've already had<br />
some sort of training.    </p>
<p>♪ <em>I'm a fool to do your dirty work</em> ♪    </p>
<p>- ♪ <em>Oh, yeah</em> ♪    </p>
<p>- ♪ <em>I don't wanna do your dirty work</em> ♪</p>
<p>♪ <em>No more</em> ♪    </p>
<p>- ♪ <em>I'm a fool to do your dirty work.</em> ♪    </p>
<p>We're in.    </p>
<p>Okay, just stay focused    </p>
<p>until you find the ChumNet server room.    </p>
<p>What about all the people in there?    </p>
<p>There are no people. Just clickbait.    </p>
<p>So whatever you do,<br />
don't stop to click on anything.    </p>
<p>Who falls for this garbage anyway?    </p>
<p>Wait, what does she look like now?    </p>
<p>&quot;   NFL players who live in bad houses.    </p>
<p>Number six will shock you.&quot;    </p>
<p>Well, we'll see about that.    </p>
<p>&quot;One simple trick to add    </p>
<p>years to your height.&quot;    </p>
<p>Whoa, these headlines are so tempting.    </p>
<p>No! We have to remember our goal.    </p>
<p>Erasing our shame and returning<br />
to our pre-pariah lives.    </p>
<p>Oh, no.    </p>
<p>They're all trapped in endless<br />
slow-loading slideshows.    </p>
<p>These houses suck.    </p>
<p>Sucks, sucks, sucks.    </p>
<p>Number six.    </p>
<p>Homer, get them out now!    </p>
<p>I just wanted to know which vegetable    </p>
<p>gut doctors are begging me to throw out.    </p>
<p>It's radishes.<br />
I could have told you it was radishes!    </p>
<p>Find the server room, Homer,<br />
you'll be safe there.    </p>
<p>This is prawn-demonium!    </p>
<p>Ooh.    </p>
<p><em>Okay, straight ahead<br />
is the access port.</em>    </p>
<p>Mm...    </p>
<p><em>Insert the flash drive.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Once the scrub code is fully uploaded,</em>    </p>
<p><em>everything will be erased,</em>    </p>
<p><em>and you will return to<br />
a life of anon-min-mity.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Anon-min, Amoni-mity.</em>    </p>
<p><em>It's &quot;anonymity.&quot;</em>    </p>
<p><em>Preparing global Internet scrub<br />
for the following individuals.</em>    </p>
<p>There we are.    </p>
<p>Wait, who are they?<br />
I recognize these people.    </p>
<p>They're really terrible.    </p>
<p>That guy raised the<br />
price of insulin for fun.    </p>
<p>I think that guy was just president,    </p>
<p>and those are his kids.    </p>
<p>And, oh, my God,    </p>
<p>that's the football coach<br />
that does all the cheating!    </p>
<p>Yes, Homer.<br />
All evidence of their misdeeds    </p>
<p>will be erased too.    </p>
<p>But that's different.    </p>
<p>Those people did actual bad stuff.    </p>
<p>Wow, lot of Russian generals.    </p>
<p><em>Upload at   %.</em>    </p>
<p>Jeebus crackers.    </p>
<p>So the only way to save myself    </p>
<p>is to erase the crimes of<br />
history's current monsters?    </p>
<p>Oh, wise up, Homer.    </p>
<p>Who do you think funded<br />
this entire operation?    </p>
<p>Scrubbing these villains    </p>
<p>is what The Institute<br />
was always really about.    </p>
<p>What do I do?    </p>
<p>Wait, I never had a handkerchief.    </p>
<p>Oh, this is the apology<br />
Lisa wrote for me.    </p>
<p>The upload's nearly complete.    </p>
<p>I can think of almost<br />
nothing at the last minute    </p>
<p>that will stop us now.    </p>
<p>&quot;It is with my family's support    </p>
<p>that I will strive to<br />
do the right thing.&quot;    </p>
<p>I will strive to do the right thing!    </p>
<p>Homer, listen,<br />
you don't know what my investors    </p>
<p>are capable of doing to people<br />
who don't help them cover up    </p>
<p>what they're capable of doing.    </p>
<p>You don't know what<br />
I'm capable of doing.    </p>
<p>Yoinking this doodad out<br />
of the computer hole.    </p>
<p><em>Internet scrub cancelled.</em>    </p>
<p>Idiot! You ruined it!    </p>
<p>No, my daughter ruined it    </p>
<p>by writing the most genuine<br />
and inspirational apology ever.    </p>
<p>You should hear it.    </p>
<p>I'm Homer Simpson, and I'm truly sorry.    </p>
<p>Sorry, yet also grateful    </p>
<p><em>for this opportunity...</em>    </p>
<p><em>In the annals of time,</em>    </p>
<p><em>there have only been five</em>    </p>
<p><em>truly great public apologies.</em>    </p>
<p><em>But on that day,</em>    </p>
<p><em>the words Lisa wrote,<br />
and Homer somehow read</em>    </p>
<p><em>to everyone in the world,</em>    </p>
<p><em>put those others to shame.</em>    </p>
<p><em>It was deeply soul-searching</em>    </p>
<p><em>and    % effective.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Homer was forgiven by all</em>    </p>
<p><em>and beloved forever.</em>    </p>
<p>You failed us.    </p>
<p>We're gonna do to you<br />
what we did to democracy:    </p>
<p>irreparable damage.    </p>
<p>The plan<em> was</em> too radical.    </p>
<p>Too radical! No, no, no!    </p>
<p><em>Radical...</em>    </p>
<p><em>Radical!</em>    </p>
<p>And because of all of you,<br />
from here forward,    </p>
<p>I will be the best<br />
Homer Simpson I can be.    </p>
<p>There you have it...<br />
a reminder that we could all be    </p>
<p>a little more understanding<br />
of one another's humanity.    </p>
<p>Up next,    </p>
<p>dumb idiot has heart<br />
attack on treadmill.    </p>
<p>Another plate of shrimp. J.K.    </p>
<p>It's prawns.    </p>
<p>I should have listened to you all along.    </p>
<p>Yeah. Well, mostly, you just    </p>
<p>shouldn't have left the dog in the car.    </p>
<p>Yeah, agree to disagree.    </p>
<p>But he and I have an arrangement.    </p>
<p>Shh!</p>
