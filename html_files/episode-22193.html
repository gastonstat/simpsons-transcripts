<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>(SCREAMING) (BRAKES SCREECHING)</p>
<p>I don't understand this game, Bart.</p>
<p>How come we have to rake your lawn while you just get to sit there?</p>
<p>Because I'm &quot;it&quot;.</p>
<p>Now whoever finishes first gets lemonade.</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>: Yay!</p>
<p>For me.</p>
<p>Later when we wash his bike, I'm not gonna do a good job.</p>
<p>I'm telling Mr. Bart!</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>(GIGGLING)</p>
<p>Uh-oh. Girls.</p>
<p>You guys need your cootie shots.</p>
<p>(BOTH CRYING OUT IN PAIN)</p>
<p>Well, I hate this job, but I love the health plan.</p>
<p>Okay, ladies. Don't you have a poodle to dress up?</p>
<p>Fine, we'll go.</p>
<p>We'll find some other way to entertain our boy-crazy cousin who thinks you're cute.</p>
<p>Oh, I wouldn't mind pushing that in the mud.</p>
<p>(MUMBLING)</p>
<p>Homer drunk? But how?</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Round and round the bottle twirls, I hope it stops on one of the girls.</p>
<p>(GASPING)</p>
<p>I hope you like the taste of ringworm medicine.</p>
<p>Ew!</p>
<p>Ugh!</p>
<p>Ew! I kissed that sad weird kid!</p>
<p>My beer!</p>
<p>You never had a chance to become my urine.</p>
<p>(SOBBING)</p>
<p>Why you little...</p>
<p>(CHOKING)</p>
<p>My first kiss.</p>
<p>Stop it, Homer! There's only one way to settle this.</p>
<p>In Simpson Family Court.</p>
<p>What the hell's that?</p>
<p>I got the idea from a now discredited book on raising children.</p>
<p>(GAVEL BANGS)</p>
<p>Now up, the case of Simpson v. Simpson.</p>
<p>Mr. Simpson, do you think it's appropriate for a 10-year-old boy to steal a beer with intent to kiss?</p>
<p>Do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son's little league team?</p>
<p>What? Permission to treat this witness as hostile.</p>
<p>Homer, I'll bet when you were 10, you were stealing beers, kissing girls, and tipping dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Your father's first kiss was in high school, with me.</p>
<p>Actually, Marge, there was someone before you.</p>
<p>(GASPING)</p>
<p>It was years ago when I was 1 0, back in the '60s or '50s.</p>
<p>Or maybe it was the early '70s.</p>
<p>Underprivileged?</p>
<p>You pretended we were poor just to get me into camp?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, pretended.</p>
<p>Hey, you must be Homer! I'm Lenny and this is Carl.</p>
<p>Wow, a n*gro.</p>
<p>We prefer the term &quot;black.&quot;</p>
<p>So cool.</p>
<p>Heya, fellas. I'm Moe. I'm your junior counselor.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING) Moe's not really a counselor.</p>
<p>His parents dropped him off here, like, two years ago and they never came back for him.</p>
<p>I sleep under upside-down canoes.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)</p>
<p>(b*at MUSIC PLAYING)</p>
<p>(CARL AND LENNY GROANING)</p>
<p>(ALL LAUGHING)</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>In the summertime when the weather is high (ALL YELLING)</p>
<p>That's the girls' camp right over there.</p>
<p>(COY GIGGLING)</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Oh! I can't wait to meet the girls!</p>
<p>(All) Wha...</p>
<p>That's right. You're working in the kitchen.</p>
<p>That's how our camp pays the bills.</p>
<p>What bills?</p>
<p>We got no water, no heat. We catch our own breakfast.</p>
<p>Twelve kids died at our camp. We need the money to pay lawyers.</p>
<p>I thought we were gonna play fun games at camp.</p>
<p>Oh, here's one!</p>
<p>It's called &quot;Stay out of my way.&quot; Idiot.</p>
<p>(Young Marge) Oh, no. My retainer.</p>
<p>I got it!</p>
<p>Ooh la la!</p>
<p>A girl with teeth! Me like.</p>
<p>(Young Marge) Oh, thank you. You sound so sweet.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING)</p>
<p>That's 'cause I've eaten 16 pieces of pie.</p>
<p>(BOTH GIGGLING)</p>
<p>You know, doing dishes has been the best part of camp.</p>
<p>(Young Marge) Really? Why?</p>
<p>Because I talked to you.</p>
<p>(Young Marge) Aw!</p>
<p>I couldn't see her through the flaps, but she's my kind of girl.</p>
<p>Tell us more about the flaps.</p>
<p>To me, they were the rubbery gates of heaven because behind them was the girl of my dreams.</p>
<p>Oh, man. Someday love'll come sliding down my chute.</p>
<p>Well, I can ask if she has any friends because she wants to meet me tonight.</p>
<p>Way to go! Out of sight!</p>
<p>Now, Homer, if you're gonna go, you better take some protection.</p>
<p>Oh, a switchblade!</p>
<p>I see the switch, but where's the blade?</p>
<p>(CLICKING) D'oh! Found it.</p>
<p>An eye patch? But I've got a date tonight.</p>
<p>Oh, don't worry. Chicks love that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Patches, scars, stumps.</p>
<p>Everything but zits.</p>
<p>All right, how should I get there?</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>I guess it's row versus wade. And it's my right to choose!</p>
<p>Are you looking to cross the lake which separates ye from she?</p>
<p>Who are you?</p>
<p>The sailing instructor.</p>
<p>And on movie night, I run the projector.</p>
<p>Only PG. Nothing R.</p>
<p>Yarrr.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: I couldn't believe my eye.</p>
<p>She was the prettiest girl I'd ever seen.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)</p>
<p>Until I met your mother, who made that girl look like a Godzilla made of garbage!</p>
<p>Homer, that girl was me!</p>
<p>(ALL GASPING)</p>
<p>How romantic.</p>
<p>You and Dad were drawn to each other as kids and you didn't even realize it!</p>
<p>Yes. And then your father broke my heart.</p>
<p>And if I'd known it was you, I never would have married you.</p>
<p>Oh, this is so confusing! I'd like a brief recess.</p>
<p>Granted. (BANGS GAVEL)</p>
<p>Whee! Recess!</p>
<p>(DOOR SLAMS SHUT)</p>
<p>(GIGGLING)</p>
<p>Whee!</p>
<p>Let me get this straight.</p>
<p>When you were my age, you had the hots for Mom and didn't even know it?</p>
<p>Oh, that's cool or is it lame?</p>
<p>I guess I'll go with lame. You were lame!</p>
<p>Why? Because I only kissed one girl in my whole life?</p>
<p>That's still one more than you.</p>
<p>I've kissed three girls.</p>
<p>(SOBBING)</p>
<p>I'm so lame!</p>
<p>You're not gonna be kissing anybody for a while!</p>
<p>Well, that stinks!</p>
<p>But I still get to kiss you, right?</p>
<p>(GRUMBLES)</p>
<p>Mom, why are you so mad?</p>
<p>I'll start from the beginning.</p>
<p>The girls' camp was focused on teaching etiquette and deportment.</p>
<p>Now that I've captured your interest, let me continue.</p>
<p>By summer's end, I promise you will all walk like ladies, talk like ladies, and hold your liquor like ladies.</p>
<p>Now chin up, head back, legs together. Excellent.</p>
<p>Girls, see how Marge's legs are slanted?</p>
<p>You make Jackie O look like a splay-legged milk-horse.</p>
<p>Now stand and walk.</p>
<p>(STRUGGLING)</p>
<p>Well done.</p>
<p>I'd be proud if you grew up to be my husband's mistress.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I used to walk like this all the time until my tendons snapped.</p>
<p>They heard it in Shelbyville.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, one night we had a special dinner.</p>
<p>We were learning to use all 33 forks.</p>
<p>Young lady, that is not an olive fork!</p>
<p>Here's a simple trick to help you remember.</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>Hmm. Mmm-hmm.</p>
<p>kn*fe and fork together, denied yourself dessert.</p>
<p>Nice work, Marge. Really.</p>
<p>Oh, no! My retainer!</p>
<p>(Young Homer) I got it!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>I'd thank you, but I don't even know your name.</p>
<p>I bet it's something low-rent like Billy Bob.</p>
<p>Or Homer.</p>
<p>Big ugly Homer!</p>
<p>(GIGGLING SPITEFULLY)</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sure it's a much nicer name than Homer.</p>
<p>Er...</p>
<p>Think, Homer. Think.</p>
<p>(Young Marge) What did you say?</p>
<p>I'm Elvis!</p>
<p>Elvis Jagger. Elvis Jagger Abdul-Jabbar.</p>
<p>(LAUGHING HEARTILY)</p>
<p>I told my friends I had a date.</p>
<p>What should I wear?</p>
<p>Should I paint my toes?</p>
<p>And what should I do with my hair?</p>
<p>You could iron it.</p>
<p>Iron my hair?</p>
<p>That's what Leslie Uggams does!</p>
<p><strong>Bart</strong>: Leslie who?</p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: Uggams!</p>
<p>Oh, it's really straightening out.</p>
<p>(CRIES OUT) Hmm.</p>
<p>I guess I'm going to have to be a brunette tonight.</p>
<p>Oh, dear me.</p>
<p>One day as a straight-haired brunette. I feel so bad for you.</p>
<p>Stupid girl!</p>
<p>Please don't be a freak. Please don't be a freak.</p>

<p>(Sea Captain) I met her on the mountain.</p>
<p>There I took her life.</p>
<p>Met her on the mountain.</p>
<p>Stabbed her with my kn*fe (WHIMPERING)</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Oh. He's cute.</p>
<p>And he's got an eye patch.</p>
<p>I've never seen a boy so mysterious.</p>
<p>You must be Elvis.</p>
<p>Elvis? What the hell kind of name is...</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Right.</p>
<p>We've heard the same story two times now.</p>
<p>Whose side are we gonna hear next? The Sea Captain's?</p>
<p>No, no. I'd best be on me way.</p>
<p>I'll just take some Teddy Grahams for the road.</p>
<p>There goes a good friend.</p>
<p>Now I'm gonna warn you kids, the next part of the story gets a little WB.</p>
<p>Oh, man. I want to kiss her.</p>
<p>Wait. I just thought of the greatest move ever!</p>
<p>(EXAGGERATED YAWNING)</p>
<p>Oh, no. He yawned. I'm boring him.</p>
<p>Do you like music? I do.</p>
<p>I like Bobby Goldsboro, Gilbert O'Sullivan, Terry Jacks, Parliament, but not Funkadelic.</p>
<p>How am I supposed to kiss those things?</p>
<p>Interrupt her with something witty.</p>
<p>Er...</p>
<p>Um...</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>Kiss her already. What are you, chicken?</p>
<p>(CLUCKING)</p>
<p>Is he making chicken noises?</p>
<p>Imagine me and you, I do.</p>
<p>I think about you day and night it's only right.</p>
<p>To think about the girl you love and hold her tight.</p>
<p>So happy together.</p>
<p>If I should call you up, invest a dime.</p>
<p>And you say you belong to me and ease my mind.</p>
<p>Imagine how the world could be so very fine.</p>
<p>So happy together.</p>
<p>Ahhh!</p>
<p>I can't see me lovin' nobody but you.</p>
<p>For all my life.</p>
<p>When you're with me, baby the skies'll be blue.</p>
<p>For all my life.</p>
<p>Me and you and you and me.</p>
<p>No matter how they toss the dice it had to be.</p>
<p>The only one for me is you, and you for me So happy together.</p>
<p>Way to go, Dad!</p>
<p>The perfect kiss!</p>
<p>It was pretty delicious.</p>
<p>It was as satisfying as a million Hallmark cards with all the right sized envelopes.</p>
<p>(SIGHING)</p>
<p>It felt like a cluster b*mb wiping out a graveyard full of zombies.</p>
<p>(SIGHING)</p>
<p>But then your father showed his true colors.</p>
<p>Uh-oh!</p>
<p>Will I see you again tomorrow?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Or my name isn't...</p>
<p>Whatever I told you it was.</p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: So we arranged to meet again at Second Date Rock.</p>
<p>(HUMMING)</p>
<p>(SIGHING)</p>
<p>I guess he's not coming.</p>
<p>It was years before I could trust a boy again.</p>
<p>(SOBBING)</p>
<p>That's horrible. How could you, Dad?</p>
<p>Because he's the kind who kisses and leaves you!</p>
<p>(SOBBING)</p>
<p>I can't believe you stood Mom up.</p>
<p>Face it, Lise. Men are dogs.</p>
<p>The worse we treat you, the more you want us.</p>
<p>That's not what dogs do.</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>You said &quot;dog doo!&quot;</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING)</p>
<p>She sure did.</p>
<p>Now if Lisa's finished with her shenanigans, I'll tell you why I didn't show up.</p>
<p>We had just finished our first smooch.</p>
<p>And I felt a feeling I had never felt before.</p>
<p>I found this stone earlier. I was gonna use it as a nerd smasher.</p>
<p>But I want you to have it.</p>
<p>Ooh, it looks like a heart.</p>
<p>Hey, you're right! Give it back!</p>
<p>Oh, no, I still want you to have it.</p>
<p>But every time you smash a nerd with it, think of me.</p>
<p>I will.</p>
<p>See you tomorrow night, okay?</p>
<p>(SIGHING)</p>
<p>What a kiss. If I died now, I'd die happy.</p>
<p>(SCREAMING)</p>
<p>Oh, what a view!</p>
<p>(SCREAMING)</p>
<p>Good ol' patch! You saved my life!</p>
<p>Ahhh!</p>
<p>So you thought you could make a break for it, did you?</p>
<p>Well, no one ever escapes from Fat Camp.</p>
<p>Because the only way out is up a gentle slope.</p>
<p>What the... Fat Camp?</p>
<p>(WHISTLE BLOWING)</p>
<p>(GROANING)</p>
<p>(PANTING)</p>
<p>I don't belong here!</p>
<p>Heh! Your boy bosoms tell a different tale.</p>
<p>(GRUNTING)</p>
<p>Okay. Take a break, ladies.</p>
<p>No eating the grass!</p>
<p>Hey, he didn't say nothing about this poison oak!</p>
<p>Sweet, sweet poison.</p>
<p>Uh-oh! (GROANING)</p>
<p>(VIBRATING) Ohhh...</p>
<p>I've gotta go.</p>
<p>I've got a date.</p>
<p>Yeah, you've got a date with a skinless chicken breast.</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Somewhere out there, she's waiting for me.</p>
<p>Hello. I'd like to speak to Elvis Jagger Abdul-Jabbar.</p>
<p>Hey, don't you try and prank me with a fake name!</p>
<p>I will out your intestines and use them to make a lanyard!</p>
<p>Hello? Hello?</p>
<p>(GRUNTS ANGRILY) And that's the origin of that.</p>
<p>(SOBBING)</p>
<p>That boy I kissed wouldn't even tell me his real name.</p>
<p>Typical. All boys want the same thing, to kiss until they're hot and heavy, then vamoose.</p>
<p>Trust us.</p>
<p>We know everything about boys except what they look like below the waist.</p>
<p>I have some theories based on a G. L. Joe I bought.</p>
<p>Well, I... I never want to date a boy again!</p>
<p>(SOBBING)</p>
<p>Are you leaving camp because of that boy?</p>
<p>Because that's what I've been telling everybody.</p>
<p>You're also pregnant.</p>
<p>I just can't stay here.</p>
<p>Everything reminds me of him.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>(GRUNTING)</p>
<p>Oh, the pain!</p>
<p>(GROANING)</p>
<p>Man was not meant to sit up! Oh!</p>
<p>We've got an emergency here. We need 10 cc's pronto.</p>
<p>And by cc's, I mean cupcakes.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: I know what you mean, Bill.</p>
<p>I've worked here longer than you.</p>
<p>Now's my chance!</p>
<p>(PANTING)</p>
<p>Love conquers all!</p>
<p>Snake!</p>
<p>Bye-bye!</p>
<p>Thank God they're gone.</p>
<p>I can't believe I went five minutes without one of these dream sticks.</p>
<p>Hey, have you two longshoremen seen a pretty girl?</p>
<p>If you are who I think you are, that girl is gone.</p>
<p>And she never wants to see you again.</p>
<p>She wouldn't do that. We shared something special.</p>
<p>What? Just 'cause she smooched you?</p>
<p>Was that special?</p>
<p>(SOBBING) No!</p>
<p>(SOBBING)</p>
<p>I just blew my first chance at true love.</p>
<p>And now that my special girl has heard the truth, I know she'll forgive me.</p>
<p>Earth to special girl, you'll forgive me, right?</p>
<p>I guess so.</p>
<p>Uh, I think we'll go to bed now.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>If they fight in front of us, we might get new bikes.</p>
<p>Homer, when you nurse a hurt for 30 years, it doesn't go away in an instant.</p>
<p>What about now?</p>
<p>(FRUSTRATED NOISE)</p>
<p>What about now?</p>
<p>No, Homer.</p>
<p>What about now?</p>
<p>No, Homer.</p>
<p>What about now?</p>
<p>No, Homer.</p>
<p>Marge, I'm really sorry I hurt you.</p>
<p>But I've done way worse stuff since then.</p>
<p>There was the g*n I hid from you.</p>
<p>The time I sued the church.</p>
<p>Ruining Lisa's wedding in the future. Remember that?</p>
<p>Homie, I know this shouldn't bother me, but a girl only has one first love.</p>
<p>(SIGHING)</p>
<p>I guess it didn't mean that much to you.</p>
<p>That's not true!</p>
<p>I thought about that girl every day of my life until I met you.</p>
<p>I wish there was some way I could believe that.</p>
<p>All right. This is my memory box.</p>
<p>I haven't opened it in 30 years.</p>
<p>Ooh! A letter from my old pen pal.</p>
<p>Someday I'll write you back, Osama.</p>
<p>Ah! Here's what I'm looking for.</p>
<p>Oh, Homie! You did care!</p>
<p>I sure did.</p>
<p>I kept it right next to my IBM stocking.</p>
<p>I kept my heart, too.</p>
<p>Because somehow you realized I was a good guy after all?</p>
<p>No. As a reminder of the hurtful things men can do.</p>
<p>(GULPING)</p>
<p>But now it can have a second meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: Oh, Elvis.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Oh, anonymous girl who turned out to be Marge!</p>
<p>(KISSING)</p>
