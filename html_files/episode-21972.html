<p>Damn FDA. Why can't it all be marshmallow?</p>
<p>Bart, don't put the non-marshmallow pieces back in the box.</p>
<p>They go in the trash.</p>
<p>You like sweets, kids?</p>
<p>I know a place that's sweeter than sweetness itself.</p>
<p>In this sweet place, earthly doughnuts are sour as poison.</p>
<p>You'd spit them out, you would.</p>
<p>I'm talking about the Candy lndustry Trade Show.</p>
<p>How did you get tickets?</p>
<p>They hid them in every millionth Krusty Klump Bar... and Krusty Klump Bar with almonds.</p>
<p>Hey. Hey.</p>
<p>I have asked you nicely not to mangle my merchandise.</p>
<p>You leave me no choice but to ask you nicely again.</p>
<p>Can I come to the candy show? Can I?</p>
<p>No, me. Take me, me, me.</p>
<p>Sorry, kids.</p>
<p>But this the one event I want my darling wife by my side.</p>
<p>0h, well, thank you, Homer. But take one of the kids.</p>
<p>Marge, they can't carry enough candy.</p>
<p>They have puny little muscles. Not big, ropy ones like you.</p>
<p>You go, Mom. For the greater good.</p>
<p>For the greater good.</p>
<p>Homer, are all these pockets necessary?</p>
<p>They wouldn't be if you would sit in a hollowed-out wheelchair.</p>
<p>Well, that's the babysitter. No one in town will sit for you two anymore.</p>
<p>I had to choose between a grad student at the university or a scary-looking hobo.</p>
<p>Please, the hobo. Please, the hobo. The hobo.</p>
<p>Hi. I'm Ashley Grant.</p>
<p>Ashley Grant. You gave a talk on women's issues at my school... on how we don't have to be second-class citizens.</p>
<p>Mom, how can you leave us with this maniac?</p>
<p>Hurry. If we're early, we can get a picture... with the two surviving Musketeers.</p>
<p>There's also a baby somewhere upstairs.</p>
<p>So you're one of those &quot;don't-call-me-a-chick&quot; chicks, huh?</p>
<p>Sorry about my unenlightened brother.</p>
<p>He will make the next few hours a living hell.</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know.</p>
<p>See this, Bart?</p>
<p>Disemboweler IV.</p>
<p>The game where condemned criminals dig at each other with rusty hooks.</p>
<p>Do a little housework and you can play for five minutes.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>See, Lisa? Male's aren't hard to tame.</p>
<p>They all follow their video cartridges.</p>
<p>Mr. Goodbar to the front desk.</p>
<p>The front desk is looking for Mr. Goodbar.</p>
<p>I feel like a kid in some kind of a store.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>Exquisite.</p>
<p>You'll do well. Give me those.</p>
<p>Well, as you can see, I have created a lemon ball so sour... it can only be safely contained in a magnetic field.</p>
<p>The candy, known as 77X42...</p>
<p>Where the hell is the candy?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Hey, sir. Try our wax lips.</p>
<p>It's the candy of 1000 uses.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>One, a humorous substitute for your own lips.</p>
<p>Keep going.</p>
<p>Two...</p>
<p>I'm needed in the basement.</p>
<p>You're gonna have to put some sugar on that celery or get out, ma'am.</p>
<p>Gummi bears. Gummi calves' heads.</p>
<p>Gummi jawbreakers.</p>
<p>What's that?</p>
<p>That is the rarest gummi of them all.</p>
<p>The gummi Venus de Milo, carved by gummi artisans... who work exclusively in the medium of gummi.</p>
<p>Will you two stop saying &quot;gummi&quot; so much?</p>
<p>Must have rare gummi. Distract the salesman.</p>
<p>No. I won't make a spectacle out of myself any further.</p>
<p>How did they get there?</p>
<p>Now, this is going to take all my k*ll.</p>
<p>Halt! Halt!</p>
<p>Run, Marge. Save the booty.</p>
<p>After him. He has the gummi.</p>
<p>See you in hell, candy boy!</p>
<p>Lis, I found a big caramel deposit on her back.</p>
<p>I'm coming.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Wait. Where's my gummi de Milo?</p>
<p>Okay, don't panic. She can't have gotten far. She has no arms.</p>
<p>I'm sure it'll turn up.</p>
<p>Take the babysitter home now. She's been in the car for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Relax, Marge. There's plenty for her to do in there.</p>
<p>See? She's having the time of her life.</p>
<p>So a graduate student, huh?</p>
<p>How come you can go to the moon, but can't make my shoes smell good?</p>
<p>I'm sorry?</p>
<p>Nobody's blaming you.</p>
<p>Could you take the wheel for a second?</p>
<p>I have to scratch in two places at once.</p>
<p>Just drop me off here.</p>
<p>Precious Venus.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Hey, kids. Lots of candy left for breakfast.</p>
<p>Why don't we give it to some needy children then?</p>
<p>The candy conventioneers tracked us down.</p>
<p>There he is. There's the man that sexually harassed me.</p>
<p>For a minute there I thought I was in big trouble. It's just a...</p>
<p>Two, four, six, eight Homer's crime was very great &quot;Great&quot; meaning &quot;large or immense&quot; We use it in the pejorative sense.</p>
<p>Marge, I swear I didn't touch her. You know how bashful I am.</p>
<p>I can't even say the word &quot;titmouse&quot; without giggling like a schoolgirl.</p>
<p>At any rate, I believe you.</p>
<p>I think you should go outside and straighten this out.</p>
<p>Some of their chants are very catchy and memorable.</p>
<p>You grabbed me in the car.</p>
<p>Oh, that? No.</p>
<p>I was grabbing a gummi Venus de Milo that got stuck to your pants.</p>
<p>Yeah, right. That's the oldest excuse in the book.</p>
<p>Come on. I'm a decent guy.</p>
<p>Why would anybody wanna touch a girl's butt?</p>
<p>That's where cooties come from.</p>
<p>I don't understand. What is she saying you did?</p>
<p>Lisa, remember that postcard Grampa sent us from Florida... of that alligator biting that woman's bottom?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. That was brilliant.</p>
<p>That's right. We all thought it was hilarious.</p>
<p>But it turns out we were wrong.</p>
<p>That alligator was sexually harassing that woman.</p>
<p>And the dog in the Coppertone ad? Same deal?</p>
<p>Well, that's kind of a gray area.</p>
<p>We know you're innocent, Dad.</p>
<p>Thanks, kids.</p>
<p>They seem to be building some sort of a shantytown.</p>
<p>Do your worst, protestors. You can't stop me from living my life.</p>
<p>No respect for women. No peace.</p>
<p>Try to push the right buttons now.</p>
<p>We ain't crazy about nuclear power either!</p>
<p>You people aren't allowed in here.</p>
<p>It's okay. They're with me.</p>
<p>They're ruining my whole life.</p>
<p>Marge, please, this is where I need you the most.</p>
<p>I'm counting on you to do something or say something to make it all better.</p>
<p>Okay. Go.</p>
<p>Homer...</p>
<p>I talked to the indignation coordinator out on the lawn today.</p>
<p>I said you were a decent man. She wouldn't listen.</p>
<p>Besides standing by you and supporting you, there's nothing I can do.</p>
<p>You mean, I'm on my own?</p>
<p>I've never been on my own. Oh, no.</p>
<p>On own. On own. I need help. Oh, God, help me.</p>
<p>Help me, God!</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Hello, Homer, this is God... frey Jones from the TV magazine show Rock Bottom.</p>
<p>We're aware of your problems, and, Mr. Simpson, we want to help.</p>
<p>I saw that report you did on Sasquatch. It was fair and even-handed.</p>
<p>I'll do it.</p>
<p>Somebody had to take the babysitter home.</p>
<p>Then I noticed she was sitting on the gummi Venus, so I grabbed it off her.</p>
<p>Oh, just thinking about that sweet, sweet candy...</p>
<p>I just wish I had another one right now.</p>
<p>But the most important thing is...</p>
<p>That was great, Mr. Simpson.</p>
<p>We got everything we need.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Say, can you introduce me to the Sasquatch?</p>
<p>I like his style.</p>
<p>Here comes the bouncing ball of justice.</p>
<p>Tonight on Rock Bottom: We go undercover at a sex farm for sex hookers.</p>
<p>I keep telling you, I just grow sorghum here.</p>
<p>And where are the hookers?</p>
<p>Around back.</p>
<p>But first, she was a university honors student who devoted her life to kids.</p>
<p>Until the night a grossly overweight pervert named Homer Simpson... gave her a crash course in depravity.</p>
<p>&quot;Babysitter and the Beast.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, crap.</p>
<p>Somebody had to take the babysitter home.</p>
<p>Then I noticed she was sitting on her sweet can...</p>
<p>I grabbed her sweet can...</p>
<p>Oh, just thinking about her can...</p>
<p>I just wish I had her sweet, sweet, sweet can.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Simpson, you admit you grabbed her can.</p>
<p>What do you have to say in your defense?</p>
<p>Mr. Simpson, your silence will only incriminate you further.</p>
<p>No, Mr. Simpson, don't take your anger out on me. Get back. Get back!</p>
<p>Mr. Simpson, no!</p>
<p>Dramatization: May not have happened.</p>
<p>Marge, kids, everything's gonna be just fine.</p>
<p>Now go upstairs and pack your bags.</p>
<p>We're gonna start a new life under the sea.</p>
<p>Under the sea.</p>

<p>Under the sea.</p>
<p>There'll be no accusations.</p>
<p>Just friendly crustaceans Under the sea.</p>
<p>That's your solution to everything, to move under the sea. It won't happen.</p>
<p>Not with that attitude.</p>
<p>Look, maybe this whole thing will blow over.</p>
<p>It didn't blow over, Marge. Nothing ever blows over for me.</p>
<p>Simpson scandal update.</p>
<p>Homer sleeps nude in an oxygen tent he believes gives him sexual powers.</p>
<p>Hey, that's a half-truth.</p>
<p>I don't know Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>I never met Homer Simpson or had any contact with him, but...</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I can't go on.</p>
<p>That's okay. Your tears say more than real evidence ever could.</p>
<p>Today on Ben: Mothers and runaway daughters reunited by their hatred of Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>And here's your host, Gentle Ben.</p>
<p>I just have one thing to say.</p>
<p>Let's have less Homer Simpsons and more money for public schools.</p>
<p>Ben, I have a question.</p>
<p>No, Ben. No.</p>
<p>And now we return to Fox Night at the Movies.</p>
<p>Homer S: Portrait of an Ass-Grabber. Starring Dennis Franz.</p>
<p>Portrait. Sounds classy.</p>
<p>Doesn't it?</p>
<p>No, Mr. Simpson. A cat is a living creature.</p>
<p>I don't care.</p>
<p>Now I'm gonna grab me something sweet.</p>
<p>No, Mr. Simpson. That's sexual harassment.</p>
<p>If you keep it up, I'll yell so loud, the whole country will hear.</p>
<p>With a man in the White House?</p>
<p>Not likely.</p>
<p>This is hour 57 of our live, round-the-clock coverage... outside the Simpson estate.</p>
<p>Remember to tune in tonight at 8:00 for highlights of today's vigil... including when the garbage man came... and when Marge Simpson put the cat out.</p>
<p>Possibly because it was harassed. We don't know.</p>
<p>There's no way to see into the Simpson home... without some kind of infrared, heat-sensitive camera.</p>
<p>So let's turn it on.</p>
<p>Now, this technology is new to me... but I'm pretty sure that's Homer Simpson in the oven... rotating slowly. His body temperature has risen to over 400 degrees.</p>
<p>He's literally stewing in his own juices.</p>
<p>Now here are some results from our phone-in poll.</p>
<p>Ninety-five percent of the people believe Homer Simpson is guilty.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just a television poll... which is not legally binding, unless Proposition 304 passes.</p>
<p>And we all pray it will.</p>
<p>I don't have a friend in the world.</p>
<p>Let us through.</p>
<p>We're Homer's true friends.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Come on, let us through, you vultures.</p>
<p>Oh, Marge. It's a miracle.</p>
<p>How can you judge this man... without talking to the people who know him best?</p>
<p>We got the real dirt on Homer Simpson, and the bidding starts at 10 G's.</p>
<p>I bid 10 G's.</p>
<p>Ten-five G's.</p>
<p>I need a hug.</p>
<p>How come you guys hesitated?</p>
<p>Sorry, Dad. We do believe in you. We really do.</p>
<p>It's just hard not to listen to TV.</p>
<p>It's spent so much more time raising us than you.</p>
<p>Maybe TV is right.</p>
<p>TV's always right.</p>
<p>Are you hugging the TV?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And the number one reference that I am running into the ground is: Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>Is Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>I like it better when they're making fun of people who aren't me.</p>
<p>I know. Evening at the lmprov.</p>
<p>They never talk about anything beyond the 1980s.</p>
<p>I think about weird stuff.</p>
<p>Like, what would happen if E. T. And Mr. T had a baby?</p>
<p>Well, you'd get Mr. E. T., wouldn't you?</p>
<p>And, you know, I think he'd sound a little something like this: &quot;I pity the fool who doesn't phone home.&quot;</p>
<p>I wouldn't wanna be Mr. T right now.</p>
<p>Homer. Homer, the kids have a great idea how you can clear your name.</p>
<p>The media's making you a monster because they don't care about truth.</p>
<p>All they care about is entertainment.</p>
<p>You need a forum where they don't know the meaning of entertainment: Public access television.</p>
<p>But those shows all look so crummy.</p>
<p>Well, we could dress it up a bit.</p>
<p>We can bring a fern, and a folding chair from the garage... and the most decorative thing of all, the truth.</p>
<p>There are only 49 stars on that flag.</p>
<p>I'll be deep in the cold, cold ground before I recognize Missouri.</p>
<p>Now it's time for The lnnocence Report... with Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>Hello. I am Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>Or, as some of you wags have dubbed me, &quot;Father Goose.&quot;</p>
<p>You know, everybody believed the worst about me right away.</p>
<p>Nobody cares that I didn't do it.</p>
<p>But I didn't.</p>
<p>Okay, look, I've done some bad things in my life.</p>
<p>But harassing women is not one of them.</p>
<p>Like one time, we were having this race with this stupid, old-timey bicycle... with the big wheel in front.</p>
<p>So I figure, &quot;We'll see about that.&quot;</p>
<p>So I get this big chunk of cinderblock, and l...</p>
<p>Oh, gotta go.</p>
<p>Innocent.</p>
<p>Dad, you did it. I am so proud of you.</p>
<p>The switchboards are lighting up.</p>
<p>Two calls. That's our best ever.</p>
<p>Hello? No, Janice doesn't live here.</p>
<p>Hello? Yes, I am interested in long-distance savings.</p>
<p>Very interested.</p>
<p>Marge, this is so depressing.</p>
<p>My only hope is this homemade Prozac.</p>
<p>Needs more ice cream.</p>
<p>So you don't like the old-time bikes, huh?</p>
<p>Homer, I love amateur video.</p>
<p>And your show is the most amateur video I ever saw.</p>
<p>My hobby is secretly videotaping couples in cars.</p>
<p>I didn't come forward because in this country... it makes you look like a pervert.</p>
<p>But every single Scottish person does it!</p>
<p>Oh, baby. Oh, yeah. Oh, baby.</p>
<p>Oh, no. That's Mayor Quimby.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Precious Venus.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Dad, this clears you completely.</p>
<p>You know, the courts might not work anymore... but as long as everybody is videotaping everyone else... justice will be done.</p>
<p>See?</p>
<p>Homer, I thought you were an animal.</p>
<p>But your daughter said you were a decent man.</p>
<p>I guess she was right.</p>
<p>You're both right.</p>
<p>In our mad pursuit of a scoop... we members of the press sometimes make mistakes.</p>
<p>Rock Bottom would like to make the following corrections: Wow, V8 juice isn't one-eighth gasoline.</p>
<p>And Ted Koppel is a robot.</p>
<p>There's you, Dad.</p>
<p>Tomorrow on Rock Bottom.</p>
<p>He's a foreigner who takes perverted videos of you when you least suspect it.</p>
<p>He's &quot;Rowdy Roddy Peeper&quot;.</p>
<p>Oh, that man is sick.</p>
<p>Groundskeeper Willie saved you, Homer.</p>
<p>But listen to the music. He's evil.</p>
<p>Hasn't this experience taught you you can't believe everything you hear?</p>
<p>Marge, my friend, I haven't learned a thing.</p>
<p>Let's never fight again.</p>
