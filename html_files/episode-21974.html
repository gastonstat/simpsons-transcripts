<p>Hey, Moe, you got change for a 5?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure thing, Lenny.</p>
<p>A snake in the cash register!</p>
<p>Yeah, great prank, fellas. Great.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm gonna be sick tonight.</p>
<p>Hey, Moe, you wanna smell my flower?</p>
<p>Do I!</p>
<p>I'm burning up here!</p>
<p>Taking advantage of my alcohol-soaked clothes.</p>
<p>Oh, it's funny and it makes you think.</p>
<p>I need some coffee before I black out. Homer, pass me the sugar.</p>
<p>This is gonna be great.</p>
<p>Oh, there's sugar all over the bar now.</p>
<p>That's not funny, Homer.</p>
<p>Yeah. We were just messing around, and you had to go too far.</p>
<p>How many people want Homer banned from this place for life?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Come on, everybody.</p>
<p>This bar is like a tavern to me.</p>
<p>Sorry, Homer. You should've thought of that before giving me the sugar-me-do.</p>
<p>I'm taking your caricature down from Mount Lushmore... and I'm pulling your favorite song out of the jukebox.</p>
<p>&quot;It's Raining Men&quot;?</p>
<p>Yeah, not no more it ain't.</p>
<p>Joke's on them. I'm still alive.</p>
<p>Cheer up, Homer.</p>
<p>Can't.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What if you pretended that this couch were a bar?</p>
<p>Then you could spend more nights at home with us.</p>
<p>I am not going to dignify that with an answer.</p>
<p>Look on the bright side, Dad.</p>
<p>Did you know the Chinese use the same word for crisis... as they do for opportunity?</p>
<p>Yes. &quot;Cris-a-tunity.&quot;</p>
<p>You're right. I've been wasting my life away in that dump for years.</p>
<p>That's it. I'm going to find a new bar to drink in.</p>
<p>And I'm gonna get drunker than I've ever been in my entire life.</p>
<p>Bart, where's my wallet?</p>
<p>Right here, Dad.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Wow, classy.</p>
<p>Good evening, sir.</p>
<p>Would you please leave without a fuss right now?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This looks like a nice, friendly place.</p>
<p>Sammy, you're too old to go on a date with two twins... on the same night you're supposed to marry Diane without Rebecca knowing.</p>
<p>I'll make you a bet. If this affects my major-league comeback, I'll sell the bar.</p>
<p>Woody, give me a beer.</p>
<p>I think you've had enough, Mr. Peterson.</p>
<p>My chiropractor says I can't carry you home anymore.</p>
<p>Just give me another beer, you brain-dead hick.</p>
<p>I'll k*ll you. I'll k*ll all of you!</p>
<p>Settle down, Normie. Gotta save those pipes for karaoke.</p>
<p>I love you guys.</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>There's something bothering me about this place.</p>
<p>I know. This lesbian bar doesn't have a fire exit!</p>
<p>Enjoy your deathtrap, ladies.</p>
<p>What was her problem?</p>
<p>Greetings, good man. Might I trouble you for a drink?</p>
<p>Oh, get out of here, Homer.</p>
<p>Homer? Who is Homer?</p>
<p>My name is Guy lncognito.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. This man is my exact double.</p>
<p>That dog has a puffy tail!</p>
<p>Here, Puff. Here, Puff.</p>
<p>The last bar in Springfield.</p>
<p>If they don't let me in here, I'm gonna have to quit drinking.</p>
<p>Shut up, liver!</p>
<p>My liver hurts.</p>
<p>I'd like a beer, please.</p>
<p>Sorry, you gotta be a pilot to drink here.</p>
<p>But I am a pilot.</p>
<p>Where's your uniform?</p>
<p>I stowed it safely in the overhead compartment.</p>
<p>Well, you talk the talk. Here's a loaner.</p>
<p>We need a pilot, pronto.</p>
<p>Who wants to fly to the Windy City?</p>
<p>I'll go! Me! I'm your man!</p>
<p>Conditions are a bit windy.</p>
<p>Well, on second thought, maybe I'll sit down.</p>
<p>You.</p>
<p>But l...</p>
<p>You're not just impersonating a pilot so you can drink here, are you?</p>
<p>Yeah. That's exactly why I'm here.</p>
<p>You flyboys. You crack me up.</p>
<p>But I keep telling you, I'm not a pilot.</p>
<p>And I keep telling you you flyboys crack me up!</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Alan. I'm your copilot.</p>
<p>Yeah...</p>
<p>As a change of pace... I'm gonna let you do most of the work. I think you're ready for it, Alan.</p>
<p>And I'll just get us started.</p>
<p>We'll need that to live.</p>
<p>If word gets out about this, Crazy Clown Airlines will be a laughingstock.</p>
<p>In exchange for your silence... I'm prepared to offer your family free tickets to anywhere in the United States.</p>
<p>Excluding Alaska and Hawaii, the freak states.</p>
<p>Good news, everybody. Because I endangered lives... we can fly anywhere we want.</p>
<p>Alaska!</p>
<p>Hawaii!</p>
<p>I don't know, Homer.</p>
<p>We're right in the middle of the busy housekeeping season.</p>
<p>But, Marge, you deserve a vacation.</p>
<p>It's a chance for you to clean up after us in a whole other state.</p>
<p>But getting on a plane like that seems like a hassle coupled with a burden.</p>
<p>Come on, Marge. I wanna shake off the dust of this one-horse town.</p>
<p>I wanna explore the world. I wanna watch TV in a different time zone.</p>
<p>I wanna visit strange, exotic malls. I'm sick of eating hoagies.</p>
<p>I want a grinder, a sub, a footlong hero. I wanna live, Marge!</p>
<p>Won't you let me live? Won't you, please?</p>
<p>So, Marge, pretty sweet, eh?</p>
<p>Oh, I forgot to clean the lint basket in the dryer.</p>
<p>If someone broke into the house and did laundry, it could start a fire.</p>
<p>Oh, great. I specifically asked not to be seated next to a baby.</p>
<p>We must be really flying high.</p>
<p>Those people down there look all tiny and blurry.</p>
<p>Just like the inside of a cataract.</p>
<p>Attention, passengers.</p>
<p>Due to our policy of overselling flights, this flight has been oversold.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAA rules... the first two people to the front will be upgraded to first class.</p>
<p>Okay, you two.</p>
<p>Come on, Bart, they're gonna pamper us.</p>
<p>Not literally, of course.</p>
<p>I come for the service... but I stay for the legroom.</p>
<p>Flight crew, prepare for takeoff.</p>
<p>I think I'll go get a picture of the plane taking off.</p>
<p>Marge, what's wrong? Are you hungry? Sleepy? Gassy?</p>
<p>Gassy? Is it gas? It's gas, isn't it?</p>
<p>Homer, I never told you this before... but I'm not a good flier.</p>
<p>I have to get off the plane. Let me off the plane.</p>
<p>I'm asking you nicely to open the doors.</p>
<p>Take it easy, Marge. How about if we dope you up real good?</p>
<p>Let me off! Let me off! Let me off!</p>
<p>It's okay, Marge, we don't need to go on a trip.</p>
<p>We'll just wait for the k*ll bees to come to us.</p>
<p>You know, I have this feeling that we forgot something.</p>
<p>I'm sure it's nothing.</p>
<p>Mom, are you feeling any better?</p>
<p>Yes, but I'd rather not talk about it.</p>
<p>Permit me to solve the mystery.</p>
<p>Your mother has a fear of flying.</p>
<p>So much for the days when I could say, &quot;At least my mother's normal.&quot;</p>
<p>Everybody's got a fear of something.</p>
<p>Not everybody.</p>
<p>Sock puppets.</p>
<p>Where?! Where?!</p>
<p>Mom, are you sure you don't want to discuss it?</p>
<p>Sure as sugar.</p>
<p>Lisa, the important thing is for your mother to repress what happened... push it deep down inside her so she'll never annoy us again.</p>
<p>If we don't encourage her to vent her feelings... they can come out in other ways.</p>
<p>I just realized we never had a wedding for the cat and the dog.</p>
<p>They've been living in sin.</p>
<p>Mom, you've been cooking all night?</p>
<p>Judge, jury and executioner all rolled into one, you are.</p>
<p>See, Dad? I told you Mom would have problems.</p>
<p>No, no, honey, it's all right. Really, I'm fine. I'm all right.</p>
<p>Mother always said don't complain. Be good. Behave. Behave.</p>
<p>Be nice. Smile. Be polite. Don't make waves.</p>
<p>You heard your mother's ramblings. She's fine, so behave.</p>
<p>Marge, it's 3 a.m.</p>
<p>Shouldn't you be baking?</p>
<p>In a little while.</p>
<p>Mom, can we talk to you?</p>
<p>Can't talk. Keeping myself in a state of catlike readiness.</p>
<p>Neat.</p>
<p>Anyway, Mom, maybe you should go into therapy.</p>
<p>No, I don't need therapy. I'm fine. And it's too expensive.</p>
<p>And I don't believe in it. It breaks up families.</p>
<p>It turns wives against husbands, children against fathers... neighbors against me.</p>
<p>You don't have to pay some fancy psychiatrist 10 bucks an hour... to get top-notch therapy.</p>
<p>Hello. Radio Psychic.</p>
<p>You will die a terrible, terrible death.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. That was our last caller.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm getting something now.</p>
<p>Okay. You will die a terrible, terrible death.</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>Thank you for calling Radio Psychic.</p>
<p>Do you have a song request?</p>
<p>&quot;It's Raining Men.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, Marge, &quot;Dear Abby&quot; says... seeing films about air travel can calm your fears.</p>
<p>Here are some b*at titles.</p>
<p>Hero. Fearless.</p>
<p>Alive!</p>
<p>No thanks to the plane, many of us are still... alive!</p>
<p>Alive!</p>
<p>We certainly are.</p>
<p>Pass me another hunk of copilot.</p>
<p>Dad, Mom's getting worse.</p>
<p>You have to take her to see a real psychiatrist. Look how tense she is.</p>
<p>She's fine.</p>
<p>All right, Lisa, you got your way. Your mom's going to a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>She's gonna tell Marge to leave me. It'll break up the family.</p>
<p>You'll have to live with your grandmother and pick beans.</p>
<p>Dad, I like picking beans with Grandma.</p>
<p>Well, keep it up, then.</p>
<p><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content"><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle transcripts-topic-in-post" style="display:inline-block" data-full-width-responsive="true" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3808023418243141" data-ad-slot="1728561479"></ins>
<p><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div></p>
<p>Okay, I will.</p>
<p>Good. You do that.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>You'll be picking many a bean.</p>
<p>Hope I do.</p>
<p>I don't believe it! Principal Skinner.</p>
<p>Well, well, well.</p>
<p>I never thought I'd win this easy.</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with you.</p>
<p>I have many, many issues with my beloved smother... Mother.</p>
<p>Leave that man alone with his pain and sit down.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right, how much do you charge?</p>
<p>If money is a problem, I charge on a sliding scale.</p>
<p>I can go as low as $30 an hour.</p>
<p>Keep sliding.</p>
<p>Thirty dollars will be fine.</p>
<p>First, what are your qualifications?</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>Oh, no. I'm not here to take a reading test.</p>
<p>I wanna see some credentials.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, doctor. He's just afraid you'll blame all my problems on him.</p>
<p>I'm not here to blame anyone.</p>
<p>Marge, therapy can be an intense process.</p>
<p>We'll go deep into your subconscious... and we're not going to stop until we've exposed the root of your fear of flying.</p>
<p>Don't worry. This is a private sanctuary... where whatever transpires will be just between us.</p>
<p>Oh, that's just Murray the window washer. He comes every day at 12:00.</p>
<p>But it's a few seconds before 12:00.</p>
<p>Ever since you started therapy, all you can do is talk about yourself.</p>
<p>Well, what about me, Marge?</p>
<p>I just left my first session. I haven't even opened my mouth yet.</p>
<p>You see? You see? &quot;I just left my first session... and I haven't opened my mouth yet.&quot;</p>
<p>Marge, there's no simple explanation for your fear of flying... but it can probably be traced to some childhood trauma.</p>
<p>Think back.</p>
<p>What's the earliest memory you have of something bad happening?</p>
<p>That would have to be my first day of school.</p>
<p>They got this thing called a fire drill.</p>
<p>They use it to drill a flaming hole in your head.</p>
<p>And there's only one big toilet, and they make you all go at the same time.</p>
<p>The kids at school were even worse.</p>
<p>You like the Monkees?</p>
<p>You know they don't write their own songs.</p>
<p>They do so.</p>
<p>They don't play their own instruments.</p>
<p>No! No!</p>
<p>That's not even Michael Nesmith's real hat.</p>
<p>Kids can be so cruel.</p>
<p>But it's true.</p>
<p>They didn't write their own songs or play their own instruments.</p>
<p>The Monkees weren't about music, Marge.</p>
<p>They were about rebellion, about political and social upheaval.</p>
<p>Did you talk about me in therapy today?</p>
<p>I don't think so.</p>
<p>Tell me the truth!</p>
<p>Don't tell her I raised my voice. Don't.</p>
<p>Happy family. Happy family.</p>
<p>I keep having the same dream.</p>
<p>I'm the mother from Lost in Space.</p>
<p>Ready for breakfast, Dr. Smith?</p>
<p>Oh, being stuck on this godforsaken planet... has vanquished what little appetite I had.</p>
<p>Warning! Warning! Dr. Smith refuses to do his astro-chores.</p>
<p>Why, you clattering clank of cogs and...</p>
<p>My dear lady, as you well know, my back is a disaster area.</p>
<p>D'oh, the pain! D'oh, the pain of it all!</p>
<p>Danger! Danger! My hooks are flailing wildly.</p>
<p>Wait! Daddy, wait! Please don't leave!</p>
<p>Take me with you!</p>
<p>Marge, are you aware you just said &quot;Please don't leave&quot; to your daddy?</p>
<p>No, I didn't.</p>
<p>Yes, you did.</p>
<p>And you also infringed on any number of copyrights.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about your father.</p>
<p>Sure, okay. I'll talk about Father.</p>
<p>Father Christmas. That's what they call Santa Claus in England.</p>
<p>They drive on the wrong side of the road there. Now, that's crazy.</p>
<p>People always say how small England is, but you couldn't fit it all in here.</p>
<p>Not by a long sh*t. You know what, I'm cured.</p>
<p>Marge, get back here and tell me about your father.</p>
<p>What did he do for a living?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, but you're gonna make a big deal out of this.</p>
<p>He was a pilot.</p>
<p>A pilot? This is a big deal.</p>
<p>You see?</p>
<p>Marge, this may not be the best time to bring this up... but your last check bounced.</p>
<p>Wait, I'm remembering something.</p>
<p>Yes, Marge, there's still the matter of...</p>
<p>I was a little girl...</p>
<p>Goodbye, Margie. Be a good girl, now.</p>
<p>Why does Daddy have to leave?</p>
<p>Because he's a pilot.</p>
<p>He flies all over the world.</p>
<p>I wanna see Daddy fly.</p>
<p>Margie! No, come back!</p>
<p>Daddy? Daddy, where are you? Dad...?</p>
<p>So who wants preflight cookie?</p>
<p>Fig Newtons? Hydrox?</p>
<p>Daddy?</p>
<p>Don't look at me! Don't look at me!</p>
<p>My father was a stewardess.</p>
<p>Marge, there's nothing to be ashamed of here.</p>
<p>Today male flight attendants, or stewards, are common.</p>
<p>They are?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Thanks to trailblazers like your father. You might say he was a pioneer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You might even say he was an American hero.</p>
<p>Let's not go nuts.</p>
<p>The important thing is that we've pinpointed... the precise moment when you developed your fear of flying.</p>
<p>Wait, some other stuff is coming back to me.</p>
<p>Open wide.</p>
<p>Here comes the airplane.</p>
<p>This is what a corn field looks like, honey.</p>
<p>You think those things could also have contributed to my fear of flying?</p>
<p>Yes, yes. It's all a rich tapestry.</p>
<p>Oh, thank you. You've changed my life.</p>
<p>We've really just g*n to scratch the surface.</p>
<p>There's still the serious problem of your husband.</p>
<p>That's okay. You don't have to make her into a superwoman.</p>
<p>She can get on the plane, that's plenty.</p>
<p>Thank you, doctor.</p>
<p>Whenever the wind whistles through the leaves... I'll think, &quot;Lowenstein. Lowenstein.&quot;</p>
<p>My name is Zweig.</p>
<p>Lowenstein...</p>
<p>Don't worry about a thing, honey. I'm gonna help you through this.</p>
<p>Those are all normal noises.</p>
<p>Luggage compartment closing. Cross-checking.</p>
<p>Just sit back and relax.</p>
<p>That's just the engine powering up.</p>
<p>That's just the engine struggling.</p>
<p>That's just the carp swimming around your ankles.</p>
