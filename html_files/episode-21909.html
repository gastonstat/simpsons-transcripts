<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Bret Councilman here... on week eight of the N.F.L. season.</p>
<p>Now stay tuned for six hours of exciting football action.</p>
<p>Well, bye-bye belt.</p>
<p>Homer, all those fatty... deep-fried, heavily-salted snacks... can't be good for your heart.</p>
<p>My heart is just fine.</p>
<p>A little beer will put out that fire.</p>
<p>Now with the specs for today's games... the man who's right...</p>
<p>52% of the time, Smooth Jimmy Apollo.</p>
<p>Our first game today, Denver and New England... is too close to call.</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>But if you're the compulsive type... who just has to bet...</p>
<p>Well, I don't know.</p>
<p>Mmm... Denver!</p>
<p>Woo-whoo!</p>
<p>Denver! Yeah!</p>
<p>Moe's Tavern... where the peanut bowl is freshened hourly.</p>
<p>Moe, I'd like to bet $20 on Denver.</p>
<p>I think I can provide that service.</p>
<p>Chief Wiggum, could you hand me... that little black book?</p>
<p>Sure thing, Moe.</p>
<p>I was using it as a coaster.</p>
<p>$20 on Denver.</p>
<p>Pleasure doing business...</p>
<p>H.S.</p>
<p>All right, Denver, justify my love.</p>
<p>At the end of 13 seconds... it's New England seven, Denver nothing.</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Look, Dad.</p>
<p>I made an apartment... for my Malibu Stacy doll.</p>
<p>This is a kitchen.</p>
<p>This is where she prints her feminist newsletter.</p>
<p>Dad, you're not listening to me!</p>
<p>Lousy, stupid Denver.</p>
<p>Mmm!</p>
<p>Oh, look at that, a shoe box house.</p>
<p>Lisa, you're so clever.</p>
<p>Why isn't Dad interested... in anything I do?</p>
<p>Do you ever take an interest in anything he does?</p>
<p>No... Well, we used to have burping contests... but I outgrew it.</p>
<p>If you want to get closer to him... maybe you should bridge the gap.</p>
<p>I do it all the time.</p>
<p>I pretend I'm interested in power tools... going to silly car-chase movies... and things I'll tell you when you're older.</p>
<p>Do you understand?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Bart!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Oh, look at that.</p>
<p>Why did you do that?</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be fun... if we watched the game together?</p>
<p>Uh... okay.</p>
<p>Just don't say anything, and sit down over there.</p>
<p>Over.</p>
<p>Over.</p>
<p>Over.</p>
<p>Over.</p>
<p>Lisa, I can't hear the announcer.</p>
<p>He said Denver fumbled.</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>See you in hell, soldier boy.</p>
<p>Bart?</p>
<p>Yeah, Mom?</p>
<p>While your father and Lisa watch the game... it might be fun if we went clothes shopping.</p>
<p>Mom, I'd love to, but I don't need new clothes.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Even though I'd love to spend... this sunny afternoon trying on clothes, it's not...</p>
<p>Folks, when you're right 52% of the time... you're wrong 48% of the time.</p>
<p>Why didn't you say that before?!</p>
<p>Okay, you're off the hook.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on Miami-Cincinnati?</p>
<p>I certainly do, Bret.</p>
<p>I hereby declare Miami... to be Smooth Jimmy's 'Lock of the Week.'</p>
<p>Ooh, that's a big lock.</p>
<p>I just don't trust that guy.</p>
<p>In the Cincinnati-Miami game...</p>
<p>I declare Cincinnati my 'Shoe-in of the Week.'</p>
<p>They both make a good case.</p>
<p>After evaluating millions of pieces of data... in the blink of an eye... the Gamble-Tron 2000 says the winner is... Cincinnati... by 200 points?!</p>
<p>Why, you worthless hunk of junk!</p>
<p>You want this, don't you?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>You need the winners, and I know them.</p>
<p>So call me now.</p>
<p>$5 for the first minute, $2 for additional minutes.</p>
<p>You... have reached... the Coach's...</p>
<p>Hot...</p>
<p>Line. line.</p>
<p>Lay it on me, Coach.</p>
<p>In the game of...</p>
<p>Mi-am-i...</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. versus Cin...</p>
<p>Cincinnati. cin...</p>
<p>Cincinnati. na...</p>
<p>Cincinnati. ti...</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>Don't you realize this is costing me money? we must consider... many things.</p>
<p>The wind...</p>
<p>D'oh, not the wind! is blowing out of the... west... at five...</p>
<p>Miles per hour. knots.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous!</p>
<p>Lisa, who do you think will win-- the Bengals or the Dolphins?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>The Dolphins?</p>
<p>Good, good.</p>
<p>Moe, $50 on the Miami Dolphins.</p>
<p>50 beans on Miami.</p>
<p>Homer, I got a call on the other line.</p>
<p>It's me, Mr. K.</p>
<p>What will it be?</p>
<p>Put me down for $700 on the Rams.</p>
<p>Put Sideshow down for two grand.</p>
<p>Mom, I'm tired.</p>
<p>I want to go home.</p>
<p>Can't I just lie down for a minute?</p>
<p>Bart, I think you'd look very sharp... in this shirt.</p>
<p><em>Fine. Get it. Let's go.</em></p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>You have to try it on.</p>
<p>Ooh, this one's 50% off.</p>
<p>That's because people who wear them get b*at up.</p>
<p>Well, anyone who would do that isn't your friend.</p>
<p>This looks good... and this one is very, very cute... and these...</p>
<p>Oh, look, little bow ties!</p>
<p>And don't make that face at me.</p>
<p>How did you know?</p>
<p>Touchdown, Dolphins!</p>
<p>All right, Dolphins!</p>
<p>All right, Dolphins!</p>
<p>Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p>Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p>50 big ones!</p>
<p>50 big ones?</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Daddy's friend Moe promised... to give him $50 if the Dolphins won.</p>
<p>You made a bet?</p>
<p>I wouldn't call it a bet.</p>
<p>It's a little thing daddies do... to make football more exciting.</p>
<p>What could be more exciting... than the savage ballet of pro football?</p>
<p>Well, you know.</p>
<p>You like ice cream, don't you?</p>
<p>Don't you like ice cream better... when it's covered with hot fudge... and mounds of whipped cream, chopped nuts... and those crumbled-up cookie things they mash up?</p>
<p>Mmm... crumbled-up cookie things.</p>
<p>So gambling makes a good thing even better?</p>
<p>That's right!</p>
<p>My God... it's like there's some kind of bond between us.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>We've got a troublemaker in booth eight.</p>
<p>There's a code red in booth three.</p>
<p>My God!</p>
<p>Those aren't the socks... she came in with.</p>
<p>Let's move.</p>
<p>Bart?</p>
<p>In here, Mom.</p>
<p>Don't open...</p>
<p>You could use some new underwear too.</p>
<p>Look at that stupid kid!</p>
<p>Three!</p>
<p>Three!</p>
<p>Two!</p>
<p>Two!</p>
<p>One!</p>
<p>One!</p>
<p>And the final from Riverfront Stadium: Miami 24, Cincinnati 10.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Mom sure will be happy you won $50.</p>
<p>You'd think that... but your mother has this crazy idea... that gambling is wrong... even though they say it's okay in the Bible.</p>
<p>Really? Where?</p>
<p>Uh... somewhere in the back.</p>
<p>The point is, we had a great time today.</p>
<p>To keep it that way... let's not tell your mother about our little wager, okay?</p>
<p>Okay, Dad.</p>
<p>Did you two have fun?</p>
<p>You bet.</p>
<p>We had fun too.</p>
<p>Bart is modeling his new clothes... for his friends.</p>
<p>Ooh...</p>
<p>You got to come out sometime, Simpson.</p>
<p>Good night, Dad. I had a nice time today.</p>
<p>Me too, honey.</p>
<p>Can I watch football with you again next Sunday?</p>
<p>Sure. It gets rid... of the unpleasant aftertaste of church.</p>
<p>See how good things happen... if you make a little effort?</p>
<p>Point well taken. Could you loosen my blanket a little?</p>
<p>Dad tucked me in too tight, and it's cutting off... the circulation in my arms and legs.</p>
<p>This team is fired up.</p>
<p>All right!</p>
<p>He'll lose.</p>
<p>What? Didn't you hear what he said?</p>
<p>The fear in his eyes, the quiver in his voice.</p>
<p>He's a little boy lost in a game of men.</p>
<p>Should we bet against them?</p>
<p>I'd bet my entire college fund on it.</p>
<p>Moe, $23 on New York.</p>
<p>Start spreading the news.</p>
<p>It's New York over Philadelphia, 35 to 10.</p>
<p>Yay!</p>
<p>Yay!</p>
<p>Dad, I hate to break the mood... but I'm getting nauseous.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>So, who do you like in the afternoon games?</p>
<p>The 49ers because they're pure of heart...</p>
<p>Seattle because they got something to prove... and the Raiders because they cheat.</p>
<p>In an extremely suspicious play... the Raiders win!</p>
<p>Three for three!</p>
<p>Hey, the new sign's really working.</p>
<p>It's been a madhouse, Lisa.</p>
<p>Let's see... football... football...</p>
<p><em>Homoeroticism in...</p>
<p>Oddball Canadian Rules...</p>
<p>Phyllis George in...</em></p>
<p>Oh, doctor, what a finish!</p>
<p>The final score-- Atlanta 17, Houston 13.</p>
<p>The lowly Falcons are flying high.</p>
<p>Who would have thunk it?</p>
<p>My daughter, that's who.</p>
<p>Yeah, me.</p>
<p>You pick the winner every time.</p>
<p>You must have some kind of special gift.</p>
<p>It doesn't take a genius... to realize Houston's failed to cover their last ten outings... the week after scoring three touchdowns... in a game.</p>
<p>My little girl says the cutest things.</p>
<p>Dad, Sunday is fast becoming... my favorite day of the week.</p>
<p>Not Sunday-- Daddy-Daughter Day.</p>
<p>The usual, Moe-- a beer... and a wad of bills!</p>
<p>Okay... you lucky moron.</p>
<p>Here you go, Homer, $135.</p>
<p>I used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet.</p>
<p>Now it's the smell of victory.</p>
<p>Oh, shut up.</p>
<p>Look at these prices! We could finally get rid... of those termites for the cost of this meal.</p>
<p>Tut-tut, only the best for my family.</p>
<p>I wonder where you're getting the money.</p>
<p>Can't a man do something nice for his loved ones?</p>
<p>I guess so.</p>
<p>Hello, I'm Marco, I'll be your waiter.</p>
<p>I'm Homer, I'll be your customer.</p>
<p>Never heard that one before.</p>
<p>Would you care to select the wine?</p>
<p>I'll do the honors.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>My God!</p>
<p>What passes for a wine list these days?</p>
<p>Just bring us your freshest bottle of wine.</p>
<p>Chop, chop.</p>
<p>Charming lad.</p>
<p>Oh, violin guy.</p>

<p>What's your favorite song, Lisa?</p>
<p>&quot;The Broken Neck Blues.&quot;</p>
<p>Play on.</p>
<p>It is the play-offs.</p>
<p>It's five below.</p>
<p>One fan's wearing a G-string... and the team colors on his body.</p>
<p>Maybe the paint has shut off his pores... and he's slowly suffocating.</p>
<p><em>That is a real fan.</em></p>
<p>It's Daddy-Daughter Day... and Daddy needs daughter's picks.</p>
<p>The Chiefs are my five star, silver b*llet special.</p>
<p>With your blessing, I'd like to tie it to the Cowboys... plus five at Chicago.</p>
<p>You call Moe.</p>
<p>Moe, this is L.S. calling for H.S.</p>
<p>Just bet, Lisa.</p>
<p>110, 120...</p>
<p>You lucky son of a...</p>
<p>Want to go bowling Sunday?</p>
<p>Are you nuts? That's the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>How about the Sunday after that?</p>
<p>Ma's coming in from Norway... but what the hell.</p>
<p><em>When the doctor said...</em></p>
<p>I didn't have worms anymore, that was the happiest day... of my life.</p>
<p>Thank you, Ralph, very graphic.</p>
<p>Lisa Simpson, would you like to read your essay?</p>
<p>The happiest day of my life was three Sundays ago... when the Saints-- four and a half point favorites... only up by three-- kicked a meaningless field goal... at the last second to cover the spread.</p>
<p>Dear God!</p>
<p>You must have bought me... every Malibu Stacy accessory.</p>
<p>Not quite.</p>
<p>They were out of Malibu Stacy lunar rovers.</p>
<p>Ooh, perfume!</p>
<p>&quot;Meryl Streep's Versatility.&quot;</p>
<p>I know you're going to like your present.</p>
<p>Shut up! Shut up! Kiss my butt!</p>
<p>Go to hell!</p>
<p>Dad, I promise...</p>
<p><em>I will never get tired of this.</em></p>
<p>Those were very thoughtful presents... but you have to tell me where you got the money.</p>
<p>You have to promise you won't get mad.</p>
<p>I promise I will.</p>
<p>I always do when you make me promise I won't.</p>
<p>Lisa and I have been gambling on pro football.</p>
<p>Homer!</p>
<p>You promised you wouldn't get mad.</p>
<p>I promised I would!</p>
<p>She's eight years old!</p>
<p>Marge, she's got a gift.</p>
<p>Aren't parents supposed to encourage their kids... whenever they show talent?</p>
<p>Gambling is illegal.</p>
<p>Only in 48 states.</p>
<p>Besides, it's a v*ctim crime.</p>
<p>The only v*ctim is Moe... and it's brought Lisa and me together.</p>
<p>I just don't know.</p>
<p>What's the problem?</p>
<p>The kids are happy, you smell like Meryl Streep... and I got that foot massager I've always wanted.</p>
<p>Believe me, Marge, nothing bad could possibly come of this.</p>
<p>You know, Dad... we've been watching a lot of TV lately.</p>
<p>Maybe the Sunday after the Super Bowl... we could climb Mt. Springfield.</p>
<p>The fires in the tire yards make beautiful sunsets.</p>
<p>Next Sunday I'm going bowling with Barney.</p>
<p>What about Daddy-Daughter Day?!</p>
<p>The new football season is only seven months away.</p>
<p>So that's it.</p>
<p>You just wanted me to help you gamble.</p>
<p>You never wanted to be with me at all.</p>
<p>You're a very selfish man.</p>
<p>Go to hell! Go to hell!</p>
<p>Hey, once again, great present, Dad.</p>
<p>Uh... uh...</p>
<p>My third husband bought me this.</p>
<p>Give me some chips for it.</p>
<p>Are you sure?</p>
<p>Don't tell me what to do.</p>
<p>I've been gambling since I was eight... and hocking jewelry since I was 12.</p>
<p>Give me chips.</p>
<p>Look around you, Malibu Stacy.</p>
<p>All this was bought with dirty money.</p>
<p>Your penthouse, your Alfa Romeo, your collagen-injection clinic.</p>
<p>Back into the box.</p>
<p>It may not be pretty... but damn it, it's honest.</p>
<p>I, Lisa Simpson... am hereby giving away... all my ill-gotten Malibu Stacy accessories!</p>
<p>Ahh!</p>
<p>Look, I bought you... a Malibu Stacy chinchilla coat.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>You've come to buy my forgiveness.</p>
<p>Sorry, Homer.</p>
<p>Lisa, honey, I'm sorry... but I really had a good time watching football with you... and I think you had a good time with me.</p>
<p>Yeah, I did.</p>
<p>We can still watch the Super Bowl together... can't we?</p>
<p>Well, I would like to see what the fuss is about.</p>
<p>It's a date.</p>
<p>So... do you think the Redskins... will b*at the spread?</p>
<p>Put me down.</p>
<p>I'll tell you who's going to win... but it will just validate my theory... that you cared more about winning money... than you did about me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I think Washington is a mortal lock.</p>
<p>Washington! Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p>However...</p>
<p>What however?</p>
<p>However what?</p>
<p>However, I may also be so clouded with rage... that subconsciously...</p>
<p>I want you to lose.</p>
<p>In which case, I'd bet the farm on Buffalo.</p>
<p>Do me a favor.</p>
<p>Complete this sentence: Daddy should bet all his money on...</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>If I still love you...</p>
<p>Washington.</p>
<p>If I don't, Buffalo.</p>
<p>Homer, I think that chip's got enough dip on it.</p>
<p>We're live from the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome... and Super Bowl 26.</p>
<p>Today we're going to be seen... by people in 150 countries all over the world... including our newest affiliate, W-Gimel-Aleph-Nun... in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p><em>Stupid!</p>
<p>Formidable.</em></p>
<p>Every note is a dagger in my heart.</p>
<p>I got to get out of here.</p>
<p>Moe's Tavern... home of the Super Sunday Brunch Spectacular.</p>
<p>Ohh! Baloney.</p>
<p>Bread!</p>
<p>Got you down for 40 bucks.</p>
<p>Good luck, Your Eminence.</p>
<p>You can't take more of my money.</p>
<p>I'm out of the bookie business.</p>
<p>But Moe, you've been taking bets all...</p>
<p>Barney, have a free beer.</p>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p>Don't worry, I'm not betting.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Give me that.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>I had the greatest gift of all-- a little girl who could pick football... and I ruined it.</p>
<p>We're two hours and 45 minutes through the pregame show.</p>
<p>Our guest is Troy McClure... whose new sitcom premiers tonight... right after the game!</p>
<p>Thanks, Bret.</p>
<p><em>My new show's called Handle With Care.</em></p>
<p>I play Jack Handle, a retired cop... who shares an apartment with a retired criminal.</p>
<p>The original odd couple.</p>
<p>I fell in love with the script, Bret... and my recent trouble with the IRS sealed the deal.</p>
<p>That's great, Troy.</p>
<p>Ooh! Looks like... we're almost ready for the kickoff.</p>
<p>Washington kicks.</p>
<p>Oh, it's a bad kick, way too short.</p>
<p>Buffalo starts in excellent position.</p>
<p>Buffalo's going to win.</p>
<p>Lisa hates me.</p>
<p>What did you bet?</p>
<p>My daughter.</p>
<p>What a gambler.</p>
<p>And with the score at the half Buffalo 14, Washington 7... it's time for the never-tedious Super Bowl halftime show.</p>
<p>People of Earth, we've come ten billion light-years... to bring you this halftime message of peace.</p>
<p>Oh, this sucks.</p>
<p>Come on, sn*pers, where are you?</p>
<p>Bart, who's winning?</p>
<p>You-Hate-Dad by a touchdown.</p>
<p><em>Go! Go! Go! Go! Yay!!</em></p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: ...for halfback Dan Beerdorf.</p>
<p>Duff Dry has won the Duff Bowl.</p>
<p>They wanted it more.</p>
<p>Homer, didn't you say if Duff Dry wins... your daughter loves you?</p>
<p>Not Duff Dry, Washington.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, they're both great teams.</p>
<p>Yay!</p>
<p>Yay!</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Touchdown, Redskins.</p>
<p>All right, we're back in business.</p>
<p>Well, I'm glad some people... could resist the lures of the big game.</p>
<p>I forgot the game!</p>
<p>It all comes down to this one play.</p>
<p>If Washington scores, happy fans will be looting... and turning over cars in our nation's capital tonight.</p>
<p>Please, please, please.</p>
<p>Touchdown!</p>
<p>It is done.</p>
<p>The Washington Redskins win Super Bowl 26!</p>
<p>You love Dad.</p>
<p>I suspected as much.</p>
<p>Yes! She loves me, she loves me.</p>
<p>Why are you so happy?</p>
<p>You didn't win money.</p>
<p>Money comes and goes, but my daughter and I... can go on for eight more years!</p>
<p>Come on, Dad!</p>
<p>It's... beautiful.</p>
<p>Isn't it, though?</p>
<p>After I... catch my... breath... can we... go... home?</p>
