That '90s Show</p>
<p>Dad, I'm freezing.</p>
<p>Don't worry, kids.</p>
<p>These wool socks and down parkas will keep you warm.</p>
<p>We wouldn't be in this trouble if you'd just paid the heating bill!</p>
<p>I thought global warming would take care of it.</p>
<p>Al Gore can't do anything right.</p>
<p>I got some old magazines to burn.</p>
<p>Popular Science.</p>
<p>Redbook.</p>
<p>Big &amp; Tall Halloween Costume catalogue.</p>
<p>Next item.</p>
<p>No!!!!!</p>
<p>Mom, I didn't know you went to college!</p>
<p>Yeah, you always said that after high school, Dad &quot;blessed&quot; you with the unplanned miracle of me.</p>
<p>Hey, parents are allowed to keep some secrets.</p>
<p>Like which kid's their favorite!</p>
<p>It's Lisa.</p>
<p>You know, Mom and Dad are almost 40, and Bart is ten.</p>
<p>That means you didn't have him until way after high school.</p>
<p>Yeah, what happened while I was chillin' in Dad's junk?</p>
<p>There is a part of our past that we haven't told you kids about.</p>
<p>A turbulent part.</p>
<p>Come on. More turbulent than now?</p>
<p>We're in every kind of therapy.</p>
<p>Things happened between your mother and me that we're not proud of.</p>
<p>It was the middle of a wild decade known as the 1990s.</p>
<p>The '90s? Never heard of it.</p>
<p>Oh, it was a wonderful time.</p>
<p>The lraq w*r was over once and for all, a struggling Matt Groening created Futurama, and young people believed in their dreams, thanks to a TV show called Melrose Place.</p>
<p><em>Your mother and I were dating, and we had just moved into our first apartment together.</em></p>
<p>Luann, a picture of you cheating on me is downloading onto my computer.</p>
<p>I'll know who you were with in less than six hours!</p>
<p>Unless someone picks up the phone.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no! Oh!</p>
<p><em>We didn't have a lot of money, but we were young and in love.</em></p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>I'm afraid it's Top Ramen again.</p>
<p>With you, baby, Top Ramen tastes like Cup O' Noodles.</p>
<p>You know, these IKEA foam futons do Velcro together.</p>
<p>Uh, I-I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I'm not ready to do that yet.</p>
<p>I want to wait until I'm married, or at least really drunk.</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>We should follow the lead of today's celebrity role models.</p>
<p>Sonic The hedghog says &quot;Wait until marriage&quot;.</p>
<p><em>Like all young people, I had a musical dream, a dream called inoffensive urban light hip-hop smooth grooves.</em></p>
<p>Okay, everyone, let's warm up our harmonies.</p>
<p><em>Homer.</p>
<p>Lenny.</p>
<p>Carl.</p>
<p>Lou the Cop.</p>
<p>I'll make rub to you Show respect for you.</p>
<p>Hug so safe and strong Backrub all night long!</p>
<p>I'll make rub to you!</p>
<p>But our happiness was about to unravel just like Kevin Costner's career: because of the postman.</em></p>
<p>You applied to college?</p>
<p>Why didn't you tell me?</p>
<p>I did tell you.</p>
<p>I thought you were telling me you wanted to apply yourself to making a collage.</p>
<p>And as I recall, I was against it.</p>
<p>I can't believe I got in.</p>
<p>It's like a dream come true.</p>
<p>An expensive dream.</p>
<p>Oh, baby, you deserve every last bit of it!</p>
<p>I can get the money, but it'll mean swallowing my pride and working for... my dad!</p>
<p>Well, Well, Well, look who's come crawling back to work for your old man.</p>
<p>What do you need the money for?</p>
<p>Medicine?</p>
<p>None of your business.</p>
<p>Now give me a job at your business.</p>
<p>You're dead!</p>
<p>Die! Die! Die!</p>
<p>Suck my beam!</p>
<p>Okay, all right! Time's up!</p>
<p>This counts as your break.</p>
<p><em>But Marge's education was worth all the p*stol in the world.</em></p>
<p>This place is just like the brochure: Autumn leaves.</p>
<p>Bull sessions.</p>
<p>And that is why.</p>
<p>The Lord of the Rings can never be filmed.</p>
<p>Fraternity pledges in their beanies.</p>
<p>I think I'm gonna like it here.</p>
<p>So, have you all bought the required textbooks for this class?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Now throw them all away!</p>
<p>Everything you think you know about history is a lie.</p>
<p>For example: the Founding Fathers.</p>
<p>What did they have in common?</p>
<p>They defied a king?</p>
<p>They created a system of checks and balances?</p>
<p>Wrong!</p>
<p>They were all white, Protestant, property-owning males.</p>
<p>Evil.</p>
<p>Are you saying that America was founded on misconceptions?</p>
<p>Who said that?</p>
<p>That is exactly what I'm saying.</p>
<p><em>Fall semester, you just got interesting.</em></p>
<p>The bridges of Madison county.</p>
<p>This book sucks so much.</p>
<p>Homie, my mind has been opened in so many ways!</p>
<p>Did you know that every US president has been a straight white man?</p>
<p>Even Walt Disney?</p>
<p>And did you also know that history is written by the winners?</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>I thought it was written by losers.</p>
<p>If you think that, you should meet my new professor.</p>
<p>Professor August has shown me a side of the world I never knew.</p>
<p>Professor August, eh?</p>
<p>Who is he, somegray-haired old bookworm?</p>
<p>Uh, not exactly.</p>
<p>Marge, I hope I'll be seeing you tomorrow during office hours.</p>
<p>Uh, 3:00 to 5:00, right?</p>
<p>If my beads are parted, come right in.</p>
<p>I will!</p>
<p>To the faculty club!</p>
<p>I never heard that noise before.</p>
<p>Are you sick?</p>
<p>Hmm. I wonder what's on your mind.</p>
<p>Okay, I relate your pilot light.</p>
<p>Now I just need to do a little work on the thermostat.</p>
<p>Would you like me to tell you a story while I work?</p>
<p>One about a woman I loved and lost?</p>
<p>We're in the middle of our own story, thank you.</p>
<p>Right. No one wants to hear about the gasman's girl.</p>
<p>&quot;Just shut up, monkey man, and make the gas flow.&quot;</p>
<p>Anyway, I was growing to admire my professor more and more.</p>
<p>...so that's why instead of &quot;X-X&quot;, I think of the female genes in a more positive light...</p>
<p>Plus-Plus.</p>
<p>Professor, do you think white male scientists have marginalized the contributions of the Third World?</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>And the answer is &quot;of course.&quot;</p>
<p>Could a tribe of bushmen have invented penicillin?</p>
<p>Maybe they already have.</p>
<p>But no one asked them.</p>
<p>No one asked them.</p>
<p>Oh, Elaine, will you ever find someone who's sponge-worthy?</p>
<p>Professor August says the situation comedy is a doomed genre.</p>
<p>Here's what I say to that: no soup for you!</p>
<p>Because I am &quot;master of my domain&quot;.</p>
<p>Newman.</p>
<p>I wish you would support my comments.</p>
<p>Hey, I worked hard all day to pay for your education.</p>
<p>Can't I get all Zima'd up and have my best girl put salve on my laser burns?</p>
<p>Are the lasers supposed to burn you?</p>
<p>Apparently if all the kids fire at your stomach at once, it adds up.</p>
<p><em>Closing time open all the doors and let you out into the world...</em></p>
<p>Marge, your art project for &quot;protest studies&quot; is very impressive.</p>
<p>Thank you, Professor August.</p>
<p>Oh, please, I'm your advisor.</p>
<p>Call me Steffan.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks.</p>
<p>It-it's just a note from my boyfriend.</p>
<p>Let me guess: he's a high school flame who's preventing you from flowering.</p>
<p>Homer's perfect for me!</p>
<p>Just look at this note: &quot;I miss you. &quot;Aww.</p>
<p>Actually, Marge, if I may deconstruct that letter.</p>
<p>When he writes &quot;I miss you,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&quot; is the subject and &quot;you&quot; is the object.</p>
<p>You are his object.</p>
<p>But Homer's so supportive.</p>
<p>He's paying for me to go to college.</p>
<p>He's paying for you?</p>
<p>Like he owns you?</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but that is oppression.</p>
<p>Well, I know you'd never say anything that isn't objective...</p>
<p>Marge, your assignment is to think about what I've said about your relationship.</p>
<p>When is it due?</p>
<p>Before it's too late.</p>
<p>Steffan!</p>
<p>Marge! Marge!</p>
<p>Where are you?!</p>
<p>Are you by that Joan Miro Statue?</p>
<p>It's &quot;Juan&quot; Miro!</p>
<p>Stupid townie!</p>
<p>Hey, it's townies like me that cook your food and clean your bathrooms!</p>
<p>If you did the former better we'd use the latter less.</p>
<p>That's it, townie!</p>
<p>Run!</p>
<p>Run back to your town!</p>

<p>Marge, this dreamcatcher was given to me by a warrior of the Lakopane tribe, a tribe ruled by women.</p>
<p>I think it has already caught my dream.</p>
<p>What the hell is going on here?</p>
<p>Chanting?!</p>
<p>Homer! You're embarrassing me!</p>
<p>Marge, what are you doing in this crazy college?</p>
<p>This place is nothing like Animal House!</p>
<p>I smashed a b*at's guitar and he sued me for damages!</p>
<p>Successfully!</p>
<p>Homie, go home.</p>
<p>We'll talk about this later.</p>
<p>Fine!</p>
<p>Slam!</p>
<p>I can't do it!</p>
<p>Our harmony-laden R&amp;B doesn't make sense in this cruel world.</p>
<p>I'm taking our music to the next level : Guitar Rock Utilizing Nihilist Grunge Energies.</p>
<p>Or, as I call it: Grunge!</p>
<p>We are Sadgasm, and this song is called...</p>
<p>&quot;Politically lncorrect.&quot;</p>
<p>Pain is brown.</p>
<p>Hate is white.</p>
<p>Love is black.</p>
<p>Stab the night.</p>
<p>Kingdom of numb.</p>
<p>Closet of hurt.</p>
<p>Feelings are dumb.</p>
<p>Kisses are dirt...</p>
<p>Kurt? Kurt?</p>
<p>It's Marvin!</p>
<p>Your cousin, Marvin Cobain!</p>
<p>You know that new sound you're looking for?</p>
<p>Well, listen to this!</p>
<p>Marge! Marge!</p>
<p>Hey, Marge.</p>
<p>Homer, your music is so angry and bitter.</p>
<p>Now why would I be angry and bitter?</p>
<p>Because I'm paying for you to make goo-goo eyes at some smooth-talking professor?</p>
<p>Well, here's a question for you: why should I stay with a man who resents how I've flowered?</p>
<p>Well, if you feel that way maybe you can find someone who wants to nurture the new you, maybe someone a little older and more sophisticated, who can take you to Europe during the summer.</p>
<p>Fine by me.</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Hey. Will you sign my boobs?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Marge come back.</p>
<p>Mom, why did you stop talking for two and a half minutes?</p>
<p>It seemed like 20.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>Homer and I had the wrenching task of dividing up a shared life.</p>
<p>Okay, I'll keep the LPs, and you take the CDs.</p>
<p>I'll take the typewriter; you take the computer.</p>
<p>I'll take the Enron stock; you take the Microsoft stock.</p>
<p>And, um...</p>
<p>Who gets... Cutie-puss?</p>
<p>I just want a tentacle.</p>
<p><em>I was so depressed, I spent all my time in a bar.</em></p>
<p>Gimme a beer, Moe.</p>
<p>I don't sell booze no more.</p>
<p>This is a cigar bar now.</p>
<p>Fine. Cohiba me.</p>
<p>Leave the humidor.</p>
<p>I don't feel so good.</p>
<p>I wasn't trying to steal your watch.</p>
<p>I-I was just comin' on to ya.</p>
<p>Okay, let's go back to my place.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>Ready to take my personal tour of Springfield's most wheelchair-unfriendly restaurants?</p>
<p>I sure am!</p>
<p>I want your knowledge inside me.</p>
<p>Seeing Marge always reminds me of Marge.</p>
<p>Now where will I get my oxygen?</p>
<p>Razorblade of apathy.</p>
<p>Shave me with your irony.</p>
<p>Shave me!</p>
<p>Shave me!</p>
<p>Have you really read all of these books?</p>
<p>Morally, I couldn't display them on shelves if I hadn't.</p>
<p>But I watch sports as well, just like a regular man.</p>
<p>Good Goddess!</p>
<p>The Patriots deep in Redskin territory.</p>
<p>This isn't entertainment; it's genocide!</p>
<p>Why don't we put on some music?</p>
<p>Shave me!</p>
<p>No! No!</p>
<p>I need whale songs!</p>
<p>Oceans of the sea.</p>
<p>Marge, may I compliment your appearance?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>You look lovely.</p>
<p>If I were to approach you for a kiss, would you construe that as harassment or give your willing consent?</p>
<p>Consent, of course.</p>
<p>Ah. Continuing in that line of thought, may I kiss your mouth with my mouth?</p>
<p>Just do it already!</p>
<p><em>I had finally realized every rock star's dream: hating being famous.</em></p>
<p>Why aren't I happy?</p>
<p>I'm the hottest grunge artist on Mucous Records.</p>
<p>Weird Al is doing a parody of my song.</p>
<p>Raisin bread with applesauce.</p>
<p>Tony Danza, he's the boss.</p>
<p>Brain freeze!</p>
<p>Brain freeze!</p>
<p>Brain freeze!</p>
<p>Brain freeze!</p>
<p>He who is tired of Weird Al is tired of life.</p>
<p>Look at that lighthouse.</p>
<p>That's the ultimate expression of phallocentric technocracy, violating Mother Sky.</p>
<p>I thought they were just tall so boats could see them.</p>
<p>No, Marge.</p>
<p>Everything penis-shaped is bad.</p>
<p>Look, a wedding!</p>
<p>Slavery is alive and well in Springfield.</p>
<p>You oppose marriage?</p>
<p>Marge, marriage has oppressed women for centuries.</p>
<p>But, Steffan, I would like to get married someday.</p>
<p>Oh, Marge, it's statements like that make people say women are stupid.</p>
<p>It's statements like that that... are mean!</p>
<p>Well, it may sound mean, but I'm just trying to help you evolve.</p>
<p>Oh, evolve yourself, Professor Jerk!</p>
<p>Or should I say, Associate Professor Jerk!</p>
<p>I only got denied tenure because my department head is an idiot!</p>
<p>Der, duh, what did you say about me?</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Professor Moose.</p>
<p>You're about to get your PhD...</p>
<p>Pound Head Down.</p>
<p><em>Spread yellow g*n on my pancake heart.</p>
<p>Country-churned girl in my grocery cart...</em></p>
<p>Could he be singing about me?</p>
<p>He is!</p>
<p><em>I paid for her dreams.</p>
<p>She taught me to cry.</p>
<p>Like watery knives.</p>
<p>Like rain from my eyes.</p>
<p>I can't believe you're not mine.</p>
<p>I can't believe you're not mine.</p>
<p>Mar-ge-rine.</p>
<p>Mar-ge-rine.</p>
<p>Mar-ge-rine.</p>
<p>Mar-ge-rine!</p>
<p>Mar-ge-rine!</em></p>
<p>He loves me so much after what I did to him.</p>
<p>We interrupt this &quot;Bleak Block&quot; to bring you a breaking story.</p>
<p>Grunge trailblazer Sadgasm have broken up.</p>
<p>Reclusive front man Homer Simpson has holed himself up in his mansion, as rumors swirled about an out-of-control narcotics addiction.</p>
<p>This is Kurt Loder reporting from... the '90s.</p>
<p>No, narcotics!</p>
<p>Oh, my God, you're a junkie!</p>
<p>I need it...</p>
<p>I'm getting you off this stuff.</p>
<p>But I need it!</p>
<p>No, you don't!</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, as I later learned, that wasn't heroin.</p>
<p>It was insulin.</em></p>
<p>Homer really did need those injections.</p>
<p>I had become diabetic from drinking too many Frappuccinos.</p>
<p>Homie, I got so caught up in the world of college that I forgot how important your love was.</p>
<p>Can you find it in your heart to take me back?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>The thing that stood between us the '90s is almost over.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>But I'm worried about what's on the horizon: reality shows, Britney Spears, the suspicious number of home runs being hit...</p>
<p>At least we know there'll never be a president worse than Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Imagine, lying in a deposition in a civil lawsuit.</p>
<p>That's the worst sin a president could commit.</p>
<p>There'll never be a worse president.</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p><em>With the '90s drawing to a close, and the Sydney Olympics to look forward to, our love rekindled.</p>
<p>And one moonlight night, I finally had fun at a mini-golf course.</p>
<p>Homer, stop!</em></p>
<p>You don't have to tell the kids everything!</p>
<p>What did I miss? How did it end?</p>
<p>You two ever get back together?</p>
<p>Yep, that professor couldn't keep me and Marge apart.</p>
<p>I mean, unless he had been a little nicer at the beach.</p>
<p>Well, that professor did teach me one good lesson: Homie is where my heart is.</p>
<p>And once we were back together, I was to happy ever to grunge again.</p>
<p>Townies.</p>
