The w*r of Art<br />
Original Air Date on March 23, 2014</p>
<p>(bird chirping)</p>
<p>(groaning)</p>
<p>Hm... hmm?!</p>
<p>&quot;Lisa wants a dot-dot-dot guinea pig&quot;?</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>(humming happily)</p>
<p>(curious grunt)</p>
<p>(yells)</p>
<p><em>(Homer smacking and chewing)</em></p>
<p>(gulps, swallows)</p>
<p>(curious grunt)</p>
<p>Hey, Homer, did you know that guinea pigs are self-groomers?</p>
<p>And when they get excited, they jump straight up.</p>
<p>It's called &quot;popcorning.&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa got to you.</p>
<p>I don't know how, but she got to you.</p>
<p>(phone buzzing)</p>
<p>(chiming)</p>
<p>Emojis.</p>
<p>Now she's gone too far.</p>
<p>Lisa, your father and I are very concerned about all this hinting.</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>I've never had a pet of my very own.</p>
<p>My clock is ticking.</p>
<p>I don't want to be one of those girls who waits till she's 16 to decide if she's ready, and then it's too late.</p>
<p>(both grunt)</p>
<p>Well, we've talked about it.</p>
<p>And if you really want a guinea pig, you'll have to sign this contract.</p>
<p>&quot;I, Lisa Simpson, hereby promise to take full responsibility for this dog, cat, other.&quot;</p>
<p>Circle &quot;other.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This includes feeding, bathing, &quot;cleaning of droppings and barfings, and when the time comes, burying or flushing.&quot;</p>
<p>Boilerplate, boilerplate, boilerplate.</p>
<p>We can skip all this litter box stuff.</p>
<p>&quot;If pet becomes lnternet superstar, all rights revert to father.&quot;</p>
<p>Sign here, here, initial here, one more over here.</p>
<p>And done.</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>I'm getting a guinea pig!</p>
<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!</p>
<p>The kid-parent contract.</p>
<p>Unenforceable, yet you feel like you didn't completely cave.</p>
<p>You're doing the right thing adopting a rescue pig.</p>
<p>You know, most of these guys are rejects from the big guinea-pig mills in the Midwest.</p>
<p>Oh, I can't tell you how many mill pigs we get in here who have bumblefoot or the slobbers.</p>
<p>You don't have children, do you?</p>
<p>This one whistled at me!</p>
<p>Ooh, that could be the one.</p>
<p>Oh, but that orange guy looks like a pumpkin.</p>
<p>(gasps) But this fellow is so fuzzy!</p>
<p>Well, they all have their charms.</p>
<p>This one's nibbling a sunflower seed.</p>
<p>Look at that hair.</p>
<p>Aw, I just want to comb it forever!</p>
<p>Have you seen a pinker nose?</p>
<p>(gasps) I have now!</p>
<p>Lisa, you've just got to choose <em>one.</em></p>
<p>Lisa?</p>
<p>She's gone, honey.</p>
<p>She's gone.</p>
<p>That one's fur looks like a tuxedo!</p>
<p>A Band-Aid on its tail, aw!</p>
<p>(gasps) Albino!</p>
<p>I'm definitely getting this one.</p>
<p>Oh, but I forgot about this one.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, I never even saw this one!</p>
<p>(gasps) Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh...</p>
<p>Maybe I should get that sick one.</p>
<p>If I don't, no one else will. (gasps)</p>
<p>Bart, list your top five, best to worst.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no!</p>
<p>Worst to best.</p>
<p>I just wish the gray one had the brown one's personality.</p>
<p>Okay, Dad, give me your phone.</p>
<p>I need to look at the pictures again.</p>
<p>Aw, aw, aw!</p>
<p>Aw, aw!</p>
<p>Okay, this is the guinea pig that will make me happy.</p>
<p>She thinks she's decided.</p>
<p>Don't say a thing.</p>
<p>Don't blow this.</p>
<p>Okay, now, you sure you only want just one?</p>
<p>They tend to do better in pairs.</p>
<p>(gasps) I could get two?</p>
<p>(engine revs, tires screech)</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Farting tweakers rule!</p>
<p>I've tried to give Pokey a perfect replica of his natural habitat.</p>
<p>Peruvian feather grass, an lncan sleeping mat, and a portrait of Marisol Espinoza, the Vice President of Peru.</p>
<p>Are you sure you didn't create a perfect habitat for you?</p>
<p>I wish I could live in there.</p>
<p>Well, there's plenty of room because Pokey's gone.</p>
<p>(Lisa gasps)</p>
<p>Where'd he go?</p>
<p>(squeaking)</p>
<p>This looks like a job for... fireplace tongs.</p>
<p>(tongs clang, Pokey squeaks)</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>(Pokey squeaking)</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>He's in the walls!</p>
<p>I hear chewing.</p>
<p>No, that's a much bigger animal.</p>
<p>(grunts)</p>
<p>Kettle corn.</p>
<p>The heroin of the farmers' market.</p>
<p>I've lost my guinea pig!</p>
<p>(squeaking, tapping nearby)</p>
<p>Pokey!</p>
<p>Our boat painting!</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Mom.</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>That's okay, sweetheart.</p>
<p>Your pig thingy didn't mean it.</p>
<p>It's just, it felt comforting to know that while we watched TV, there was art going on behind us.</p>
<p>(moans)</p>
<p>Oh, well, I guess we have to go to an art gallery and buy a new painting.</p>
<p>Sure, we could go to a fancy gallery and spend a bunch of money, or...</p>
<p>Mm... hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm?</p>
<p>Yeah, Milhouse played the violin for years until it turned out the vibrations were screwing up his bones.</p>
<p>Yeah, these seem great. (sniffs)</p>
<p>Oh, too bad someone used cello rosin.</p>
<p>(groaning in frustration)</p>
<p>(gasping in awe)</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh, that's beautiful!</p>
<p>I've never seen a painting with a lighthouse before.</p>
<p>(Luann laughs)</p>
<p>Oh, that.</p>
<p>That was on the wall of Kirk's bachelor pad, back when we were (whispers): separated.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a great piece.</p>
<p>I didn't have a mirror, so I shaved in the reflection of the chrome frame.</p>
<p>This could be our new living room painting.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>How about this poster of a really rocking jukebox?</p>
<p>You know it's rocking 'cause music notes are coming out of it.</p>
<p>Painting's only 20 bucks.</p>
<p>Oh, please, Homie?</p>
<p>I'll throw in the tiny violins.</p>
<p>(Homer humming classical melody)</p>
<p>Oh, it looks great!</p>
<p>Well... to me, it looks like... garbage salad.</p>
<p>But that's the great thing about art.</p>
<p>Everyone can have their own opinion about why it sucks.</p>
<p>I've got to get rid of this ugly chrome frame from Kirk's bachelor bad.</p>
<p>I hate to think of the things this mirror has reflected.</p>
<p>Hmm!</p>
<p>Hey, look.</p>
<p>There's a signature that the frame covered up.</p>
<p>&quot;Johan Oldenveldt.&quot;</p>
<p>Here he is!</p>
<p>&quot;Johan Oldenveldt, painter.</p>
<p>&quot;Lived in Amsterdam, Paris.</p>
<p>Prolific early 20th century naturalist.&quot;</p>
<p>Ooh, I think this was painted by someone famous.</p>
<p>Maybe it's valuable.</p>
<p>We should have it appraised.</p>
<p>Pfft!</p>
<p>You guys are crazy.</p>
<p>I never even heard of that guy.</p>
<p>It's not like it was painted by Leonardo Da Vinci Code.</p>
<p>Now, here's what makes art valuable--</p>
<p>One: nudity, two: holograms, three: something terrible happening to Jesus.</p>
<p>Ah yes, seascape, marvelous natural light, classic use of gouache.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>This is an early-career Oldenveldt.</p>
<p>Quite valuable.</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>I expect it to go somewhere between 80 to $100,000.</p>
<p>(gasps) Nobody touch it!</p>
<p>Bart, stop looking at it!</p>
<p>But I want to see it!</p>
<p>No, you'll wear it out!</p>
<p>Baby, you saw something in this painting, and you were right.</p>
<p>Wow, the Van Houtens owned this for years, and never knew how much it was worth.</p>
<p>Think how happy they'll be when we sell it and split the money with them.</p>
<p>Split it? Whoa!</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... whoa!</p>
<p>(cell phone ringing)</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>Split it with them?</p>
<p>Kirk and Luann didn't know what the painting was worth when they sold it.</p>
<p>Yes, they sold it to us.</p>
<p>So, now it's our painting.</p>
<p>We can hang it on our wall, cut eyeholes in it to spy on people.</p>
<p>Or sell it for lots of money which we keep.</p>
<p>For ourselves?</p>
<p>This dude gets it.</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>But the Van Houtens are our friends.</p>
<p>Are they, Marge?</p>
<p>If you think about it, aren't they really just the parents of a kid who happens to hang out with our kid?</p>
<p>All our friends are like that.</p>
<p>Well, how would you feel if we sold them something that turned out to be valuable?</p>
<p>I would feel A) Happy for their good fortune, B) Proud to know rich people, and C) Grateful for an opportunity to learn from a mistake.</p>
<p>(door bell chimes)</p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: <em>How about this?</em></p>
<p>What if we give the Van Houtens 25% of the money?</p>
<p>Then they'll just be mad about the 65% that we're keeping.</p>
<p>Marge, you like kindness, right?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So, even if we gave Kirk and Luann some of the money, the knowledge of what they could have had will eat away at them, like piranhas devouring a wounded yeti.</p>
<p>It's kinder never to tell them.</p>
<p>Okay, I see your point.</p>
<p>We should sell the painting, keep all the money, and never, ever tell the Van Houtens.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm!</p>
<p>(deep inhale)</p>
<p>(gasping)</p>
<p>(deep inhale)</p>
<p>(Marge and Homer gasping)</p>

<p><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div></p>
<p>What'll it take to buy your silence?</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p><em>Okay, Milhouse,</em> the guys in back are shining up your new bike.</p>
<p>And all I have to do is not say anything about some painting to my Mom and Dad?</p>
<p>Oh, sweetie, you want your parents to be happy, don't you?</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>(laughing): &quot;I guess&quot;!</p>
<p>You're funny!</p>
<p>No wonder Lisa's in love with you.</p>
<p>She is?!</p>
<p>She is?!</p>
<p>So, if I keep my mouth shut, you get me new wheelie sneakers, and Bart agrees to promote and encourage use of my new cool nickname, &quot;C.J.&quot;</p>
<p>(Homer grunts)</p>
<p>You got it, Ceej.</p>
<p>(doorbell rings)</p>
<p>You found out that painting was worth big bucks, and you weren't gonna tell us?!</p>
<p>I don't know what you're talking about.</p>
<p>(loud whisper): Hide the treasure!</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Mr. S.</p>
<p>I cracked!</p>
<p>We had a deal.</p>
<p>And now we've got nothing!</p>
<p>(blows)</p>
<p>We considered you our friends.</p>
<p>We trusted you!</p>
<p>I let Homer use our master bathroom!</p>
<p>Then you stab us in the back!</p>
<p>If you knew you sold a valuable painting for nothing, how could you live with yourselves?</p>
<p>We were just trying to be... kind.</p>
<p>Kind?! You call it kind to give us nothing?</p>
<p>We were gonna treat you to dinner at an upscale chain restaurant and never explain why, but now forget it!</p>
<p>Oh, so that's how it is!</p>
<p>That's exactly how it is.</p>
<p>Oh, is it?!</p>
<p>Oh, it is!</p>
<p>(clears throat) Luann, I hope we're still on Thursday for collecting used cell phones for the troops.</p>
<p>I don't think you need any help.</p>
<p>You're so good at... collecting.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Oh, that was cold, Luann!</p>
<p>So cold!</p>
<p>Brr!</p>
<p>Sarcastic brr!</p>
<p>See what happens when we get greedy?</p>
<p>Honey, there's something I want to show you.</p>
<p>An ATM receipt?</p>
<p>I don't know whose this is.</p>
<p>I found it next to the cash machine, and I've always kept it.</p>
<p>Look at the balance.</p>
<p>Five figures!</p>
<p>With that painting, we could have what these people have: a money cushion.</p>
<p>No more living paycheck to paycheck, one lost retainer away from the gutter.</p>
<p>I could write a check with today's date on it.</p>
<p>That's the cushion.</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>Tonight, a special report.</p>
<p>Fat cat art experts take advantage of John and Jane Yard Sale.</p>
<p>So, would you characterize your friend of many years cheating you out of your painting as no big deal, or a devastating betrayal?</p>
<p>Oh, definitely betrayal, Kent.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So if you see the Simpsons walking down your street, lock your doors and hide... your friendship.</p>
<p>Great! Now we're raccoons, the masked bandits of the animal world!</p>
<p>Don't worry. No one's gonna see this stupid show.</p>
<p>(Marge and Homer gasp, tires squeal)</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>The whole town's turned against us!</p>
<p>(engine revs, tires squeal)</p>
<p>Ooh, a support rock!</p>
<p>This one's against us.</p>
<p>This one's for us.</p>
<p>For, for, against, for, against...</p>
<p>We don't even get this many Christmas cards.</p>
<p>(all clamoring)</p>
<p>(all gasp)</p>
<p>There they are, the Masterpiece Thievers!</p>
<p>Ah, shut your bone hole!</p>
<p>That painting belongs to the Simpsons!</p>
<p>Sharing is what makes a community strong!</p>
<p>All sales are final!</p>
<p>Keep it!</p>
<p>(clamoring)</p>
<p>Finders keepers, moron!</p>
<p>You really think we're still doing the right thing?</p>
<p>Just close your eyes and think of the cushion.</p>
<p>First lot: &quot;Untitled Landscape&quot; by Johan Oldenveldt, from the Collection of Homer J. and Marge B. Simpson.</p>
<p>Let's open the bidding at $80,000.</p>
<p>The paddles, Marge!</p>
<p>Look at the paddles!</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Stop the auction!</p>
<p>That painting belongs to me!</p>
<p>(crowd gasps, murmurs)</p>
<p>Dawn?</p>
<p>Good to see you again, Beef Kirky.</p>
<p>Who is this woman?</p>
<p>Uhhhhhh...</p>
<p>While you two were separated, Kirk and used to be friends... with banana-fits.</p>
<p>(Homer groans)</p>
<p>You told me you didn't see anyone during our separation.</p>
<p>Uhhhhhh...</p>
<p>Madam, are you saying this painting belongs to you?</p>
<p>Kirk stole it from me!</p>
<p>But I didn't know it was valuable till I saw the story on TV.</p>
<p>What?! I bought that painting!</p>
<p>She's lying!</p>
<p>(gavel raps)</p>
<p>The auction is on hold until we can determine the true ownership.</p>
<p>Our cushion!</p>
<p>Don't bother coming home, Kirk!</p>
<p>Aw!</p>
<p>See what your greed has done?</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>Anybody want to give me a ride home?</p>
<p>Going once?</p>
<p>Going twice?</p>
<p>(bangs gavel)</p>
<p>Sold! To the lonely auctioneer!</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>(cheering, laughter)</p>
<p>Thanks for taking me in, man.</p>
<p>I guess I can't help but feel fully responsible.</p>
<p>Oh, Luann, I'll never gaze from my thick eyeglasses into your thick eyeglasses ever again.</p>
<p>What you need, my friend, is a Canadian Duff.</p>
<p>Beauty, eh?</p>
<p>So... why <em>does</em> that chick think she owns the painting?</p>
<p>Oh, Dawn and I went on a vacation to a resort island called lsla Verde.</p>
<p>I bought the painting in a café, but that night she ran off with a parasailing instructor.</p>
<p>Not your fault, man.</p>
<p>Those parasailing guys take whatever they want.</p>
<p>It was never her painting.</p>
<p>That woman will say anything to keep herself in electric cigarettes.</p>
<p>And I'd go back to that Café Artiste to prove it, but nothing's gonna get me Luann back.</p>
<p>(snoring)</p>
<p>Okay, all I gotta do is take a quick ferry to lsla Verde, find Café Artiste, and they'll back up Kirk's story.</p>
<p>That will prove the painting was his-- and now ours.</p>
<p>Oh, Homer Simpson, that painting has torn the town apart, destroyed Kirk and Luann's marriage, and everyone's very worried about Milhouse.</p>
<p>He's been playing Dancing Revolution for hours, but the TV is off.</p>
<p>But our cushion!</p>
<p>That picture has brought out the worst in everyone!</p>
<p>Please! Just let it go!</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>You're not gonna let it go, are you?</p>
<p>I wish I knew how.</p>
<p>This is so exciting!</p>
<p>My first time establishing provenance!</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Just remember, if your mother asks, I took you to a wine tasting.</p>
<p>That's a terrible thing for a father to do.</p>
<p>That's why she'll believe it.</p>
<p>Hmm, this quaint artist community has gotten a little touristy.</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>Excuse me. We're trying to find Café Artiste.</p>
<p>Ah, yes.</p>
<p>Top of the hill.</p>
<p>Three discos up, four gelatos on the left.</p>
<p>You can't miss it.</p>
<p>It's right between the disco and the gelato place.</p>
<p>Mmm. Hmm.</p>
<p>Mm-mm!</p>
<p>(door bell jingles)</p>
<p>Mm...</p>
<p>Welcome to Café Artiste!</p>
<p>Would you like a glass of Strupo?</p>
<p>It's a liqueur made of fermented capers, the official drink of the island.</p>
<p>Mmm! Sounds delicious.</p>
<p>It's not.</p>
<p>Hey, a friend of mine, uh, bought a painting here.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, I remember that painting.</p>
<p>And that is the man I sold it to.</p>
<p>And that man sold it to me!</p>
<p>That proves the painting is mine!</p>
<p>And nothing can stop me from selling it and keeping all the money!</p>
<p>I love art!</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Art?</p>
<p>What do you know about art?</p>
<p>You don't even know who painted that picture.</p>
<p>Yes, I do.</p>
<p>It's a Johan Oldenveldt.</p>
<p>Wrong! It's a me!</p>
<p>A what?</p>
<p>I painted it!</p>
<p>Me, Klaus Ziegler!</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Mm!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>This is where I painted your so-called Oldenveldt.</p>
<p>Prove it.</p>
<p>Aw, crap!</p>
<p>You're a forger?</p>
<p>&quot;Forger&quot; is such a cruel word.</p>
<p>I'm an art forger.</p>
<p>Your painting was an early, clumsy effort which I gave to the café owner to pay off my Strupo tab.</p>
<p>Whew!</p>
<p>Then why did the auction house say it was real?</p>
<p>I have fooled galleries around the world with my loving imitations.</p>
<p>Ziegler! Ziegler! Ziegler!</p>
<p>Ziegler!</p>
<p>Ziegler! Ziegler!</p>
<p>What you do is horrible... ripping off geniuses who spent years perfecting their styles.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are the one who is horrible.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>You only cared about that painting when you thought it was created by someone famous.</p>
<p>Well, no, but <em>now</em> when I look at it, all I see is a fraud.</p>
<p>Beauty is beauty.</p>
<p>My forgeries give pleasure to people all over the world.</p>
<p><em>The only real question to ask about art, whether it's in the Louvre or on a freshman's wall at Cal State Fullerton</em> is, &quot;Did it move you?&quot;</p>
<p>But, you still, I mean...</p>
<p>Oh, I suppose you're right.</p>
<p>What if I never liked the painting and only wanted it for money?</p>
<p>Then you, I respect.</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>Oh, great.</p>
<p>The painting is worthless, (glass shatters) this was all for nothing, and when Marge finds out, she's gonna k*ll me.</p>
<p>Well, on that front, perhaps I can be of assistance.</p>
<p>If there's one thing art is good for, it's to melt the frost which often hardens a woman's heart.</p>
<p>While you're at it... could you make me a couple more?</p>
<p>I'll pay you in Strupo.</p>
<p>(sighs)</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Oh, now that's art.</p>
<p>(grunts) Rocking.</p>
<p><strong>Ziegler</strong>: <em>The Gray Troll, Brine of Madness, Angel's Urine, all names for the mysterious elixir known as Strupo.</p>
<p>Though this fermented caper solution was originally used to dissolve seagull corpses, local alcoholics soon found Strupo to be a palatable drink of last resort.</p>
<p>The noxious liqueur causes powerful olfactory hallucinations, gender confusion, and wandering mouth.</p>
<p>So if you visit lsla Verde, be sure to say &quot;ahoy&quot; to the crushing addiction of Strupo.</p>
<p>Strupo: lose everything.</em></p>
<p>Shh!</p>
