							<p>BART'S COMET</p>
<p>And now, to top off... our most propane-explosion-free Science Week ever... our grand finale: The launching of a weather balloon.</p>
<p>Go, weather balloon! Hurrah for science, whoo!</p>
<p>&quot;Hurrah for science, whoo&quot;?</p>
<p>I can't say I approve of the &quot;whoo,&quot; but the &quot;hurrah&quot; was quite heartening.</p>
<p>Release the balloon.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>All right!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>I don't think I really captured the eyes.</p>
<p>Bart, if you have a failing... it's that you're always demanding perfection.</p>
<p>If you have a failing.</p>
<p>Whoever brings down that balloon doesn't have to learn fractions.</p>
<p>Careful, children. That's my car.</p>
<p>Destroy that balloon.</p>
<p>Aye.</p>
<p>Tango 14, we're being fired at. I'm getting an ID on the bogey now.</p>
<p>Iraqis again. Launching Sidewinder m*ssile.</p>
<p>Missed him. Launching second Sidewinder m*ssile.</p>
<p>This is what happens when you cut money out of the military... and put it into healthcare.</p>
<p>It's a good program.</p>
<p>Just give it a chance, that's all I ask.</p>
<p>It won't come down for months. Curse the man who invented helium.</p>
<p>Curse Pierre Jules César Janssen.</p>
<p>Now to find out who did this.</p>
<p>Bart, empty your pockets.</p>
<p>Empty my pockets, you say?</p>
<p>Well, certainly, but I fail to see how...</p>
<p>Blueprints of the dummy, notarized photos of you making the dummy... and an alternate wording for the banner.</p>
<p>Race you to Utah, Milhouse.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I am going to punish you for this, Bart.</p>
<p>And it won't just be a simple caning this time.</p>
<p>Because you have impeded science, you must now aid science.</p>
<p>Yes. Starting tomorrow, you will assist me with my amateur astronomy.</p>
<p>Taking down coordinates, carrying equipment and so forth.</p>
<p>Four-thirty in the morning.</p>
<p>There's a 4:30 in the morning now?</p>
<p>Top of the hour, time for the news. But of course, there is no news yet.</p>
<p>Everyone's still asleep in their comfy, comfy beds. Good night, everybody.</p>
<p>Mom, will you make me breakfast?</p>
<p>There's a stuffed pepper in the trash from last night.</p>
<p>Just rinse it good.</p>
<p>Come on, Lassie. Here, boy. Come on, girl.</p>
<p>Attaboy.</p>
<p>Still dark. Better use the generator.</p>
<p>There's nothing more exciting than science.</p>
<p>You get all the fun of sitting still, being quiet... writing down numbers, paying attention.</p>
<p>Science has it all.</p>
<p>Is that the telescope we'll look through?</p>
<p>Yes, but you won't be looking through it. I forbid it.</p>
<p>But you don't need a telescope to enjoy astronomy.</p>
<p>There are all the constellations you've heard so much about.</p>
<p>There's Orion, the Swan, the Chariot Race.</p>
<p>Why don't they look anything like their names?</p>
<p>You do have to use your imagination.</p>
<p>Look, there's the Three Wise Men.</p>
<p>Who names these things?</p>
<p>Whoever discovers them. I've been hoping I can find something... that would be named after me.</p>
<p>You've never found anything?</p>
<p>Once. But by the time I got to a phone... my discovery had already been reported by Principal Kohoutek.</p>
<p>I got back at him, though. Him and that little boy of his.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's why I always keep a cellular phone next to me.</p>
<p>Now, this morning we're gonna be mapping... a square of sky that's thought to be empty. I hope it's not.</p>
<p>So, what am I supposed to do exactly?</p>
<p>Just write down my findings as I give them to you.</p>
<p>Six hours, 19 minutes right ascension, 14 degrees, 22 minutes declination.</p>
<p>No sighting.</p>
<p>Six hours, 19 minutes right ascension, 14 degrees, 23 minutes declination.</p>
<p>No sighting.</p>
<p>Six hours, 19 minutes right ascension, 14 degrees, 58 minutes declination.</p>
<p>No sighting. Did you get that one, Bart?</p>
<p>Hell, no.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>My stars. Give me the phone, quick.</p>
<p>Check out 6-19-14-59.</p>
<p>No. No, there's no need for that. It's already named after me.</p>
<p>It's pretty close to the ground. Maybe I can catch it.</p>
<p>Don't touch the telescope, Bart. Even a slight change in elevation... can destroy a whole morning's work.</p>
<p>All hands on deck. Pirates off the port bow.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Observatory? This is Bart Simpson.</p>
<p>I see something in the sky at 4-12-8, and the last number is seven.</p>
<p>Got you, my rumpy doppelgänger.</p>
<p>I've got it. What are you doing? Give me that phone.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Bart. You've just discovered a comet.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>And then I sped away without anyone seeing my license plate.</p>
<p>Sounds like you had a good day, Dad.</p>
<p>Yeah. Except I forgot to go to work.</p>
<p>What did you do today, Bart?</p>
<p>What didn't I do?</p>
<p>&quot;Boy Discovers Comet.&quot;</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>&quot;A young Springfieldianite has discovered a new comet... to be known as the Bart Simpson Comet.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you.</p>
<p>But then you've always been proud of me.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Won't you join us, Bart?</p>
<p>I guess so.</p>
<p>As the first student at Springfield Elementary to discover a comet... we're very proud to make you a member of our very select group.</p>
<p>Welcome to Super Friends!</p>
<p>Welcome, Super Friend!</p>
<p>I am called Ham, since I enjoy Ham Radio.</p>
<p>This is E-Mail, Cosine, Report Card, Database and Lisa.</p>
<p>Your nickname will be Cosmos.</p>
<p>Well, I'm done eating. Goodbye.</p>
<p>Goodbye, Cosmos.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Perhaps some night you could show us your comet.</p>
<p>There it is right there.</p>
<p>I make it a point... never turn my head unless I expect to see something.</p>
<p>Naturally, we can't see your comet in broad daylight and without a telescope.</p>
<p>But you don't need a stupid telescope. It's right there.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no! This isn't right at all!</p>
<p>It must be coming toward us at a fantastic speed.</p>
<p>Don't you realize what's happening? Your comet will collide with Earth.</p>
<p>Everything in its path will be k*ll.</p>
<p>I knew you'd try to find something wrong with my comet.</p>
<p>You've always been petty and small, right from the beginning.</p>
<p>We must alert the proper authorities.</p>
<p>To the observatory!</p>
<p>We are the Super Friends.</p>
<p>Hey, shut up.</p>
<p>Dear God!</p>
<p>Warren... we've talked about you hogging the eyepiece.</p>
<p>Sounds like the Doomsday Whistle.</p>
<p>Ain't been blown for nigh on to three years.</p>
<p>Trouble a-brewing.</p>
<p>Fellow citizens, when I learned about the impending crisis... I caught the very next plane to Springfeld. Field.</p>
<p>First, yes, there is a comet in the sky. And yes, it is going to hit Springfield.</p>
<p>You don't need to applaud that.</p>
<p>Now, here's what we think the impact might look like.</p>
<p>Show them, Jerry.</p>
<p>Oh, dear God, no!</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have a plan. Professor Frink?</p>
<p>Hi. Good evening, ladies and...</p>
<p>Einstein, what's the plan?!</p>
<p>All right, just take your seat.</p>
<p>Now, working with former Carter-administration officials... and military men who were forced into early retirement...</p>
<p>For various reasons which we won't go into here, okay?</p>
<p>We have planned this defense for the city.</p>
<p>As the comet hurdles toward the city, our rocket will intercept it... and blow it to smithereens. Right!</p>
<p>That will be the end of our Mr. Comet.</p>
<p>We're saved!</p>
<p>Will you all stop worrying about that stupid comet? It's going to be destroyed.</p>
<p>Didn't you hear what that guy in the building said?</p>
<p>But, Dad, don't you think...?</p>
<p>Lisa.</p>
<p>The reason we have elected officials is so we don't have to think all the time.</p>
<p>Just like that rain-forest scare a few years back.</p>
<p>Our officials saw there was a problem, and they fixed it, didn't they?</p>
<p>No, Dad. I don't think...</p>
<p>There's that word again.</p>
<p>Homer, what if this doesn't work?</p>
<p>Well, then I have a backup plan.</p>
<p>See, while the unprepared are still sitting around... twiddling their thumbs and going: Dad! The plan.</p>
<p>I'm getting to that.</p>
<p>So anyway, they're going: Dad!</p>
<p>So anyway, we get in our car... and take the bridge out of town. While all the while, they're still going: Dad, they're firing the rocket!</p>
<p>All right!</p>
<p>It blew up the bridge! We're doomed!</p>
<p>It's times like this I wish I were a religious man.</p>
<p>It's all over, people! We don't have a prayer!</p>
<p>And like lcarus, the rocket foolishly soared too high... and lost control of its servo-guidance mechanism... leaving us with some... six hours to live.</p>
<p>So let's go live now to the charred remains of the only bridge out of town... with Arnie Pie and &quot;Arnie in the Sky.&quot;</p>
<p>With the bridge gone and the airport on the other side of the bridge... a number of citizens are attempting to jump the gorge with their cars.</p>
<p>It's a silent testament to the never-give-up... and never-think-things-out spirit of our citizens.</p>
<p>With our annihilation imminent, our government has snapped into action.</p>
<p>We go live now via satellite to the floor of the United States Congress.</p>
<p>Then it is unanimous. We are going to approve the bill... to evacuate the town of Springfield... in the great state of...</p>
<p>Wait a second.</p>
<p>I wanna tack on a rider to that bill.</p>
<p>Thirty million dollars of taxpayer money to support the perverted arts.</p>
<p>All in favor of the amended Springfield/pervert bill?</p>
<p>Bill defeated.</p>
<p>I've said it before and I'll say it again, democracy simply doesn't work.</p>
<p>Now, over the years a newsman learns a number of things... that for one reason or another he just cannot report.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem to matter now, so...</p>
<p>The following people are gay.</p>
<p>Turn it off.</p>
<p><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content"><br />

<p>Just a second.</p>
<p>What's everyone so worked up about? So there's a comet.</p>
<p>Big deal. It'll burn up in our atmosphere and what's ever left... will be no bigger than a Chihuahua's head.</p>
<p>Wow, Dad. Maybe you're right.</p>
<p>Of course I'm right.</p>
<p>If I'm not, may we all be horribly crushed from above somehow.</p>
<p>Okay, if you're that worried about it, let's go down to the b*mb shelter.</p>
<p>We have a b*mb shelter?</p>
<p>Homer Simpson takes care of his family.</p>
<p>Flanders, open up!</p>
<p>Hidy-ho-a-roonie, neighbor. What can I do you for?</p>
<p>Get out of there. My family needs your b*mb shelter.</p>
<p>Homer.</p>
<p>I kind of figured this might happen.</p>
<p>So I built the shelter big enough for both families.</p>
<p>No deal. Out.</p>
<p>Get in the shelter, Homer.</p>
<p>One more hour.</p>
<p>An hour?</p>
<p>I can't wait another hour. What's keeping that stupid comet?</p>
<p>There it is.</p>
<p>Well, howdily-doodily, neighbors.</p>
<p>Shouldn't you be in your shelterinies by now?</p>
<p>We haven't got shelterinies. We want in yours.</p>
<p>Well, sorry. Shelter's kind of full.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Well, we'll just go off someplace and die then. Thanks.</p>
<p>Wait. You know, I may regret this when our air runs out... and we can't whistle or stay alive, but, oh, what the hey.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I can't get the...</p>
<p>I can't get the door closed. Somebody's gonna have to get out.</p>
<p>I'd get out, but I don't know where I am.</p>
<p>Hey, somebody's touching me.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>Let's figure out who should stay. Let's see.</p>
<p>In the world of the future, we'll need laughter, so I'm in.</p>
<p>And it'll need somebody to dispense drinks, i.e. Me.</p>
<p>And someone will have to run the power. You can do that, Homer.</p>
<p>Yeah. I can do that.</p>
<p>Okay, let's start again.</p>
<p>We'll need laughter, religious enlightenment, gossip.</p>
<p>That's Mrs. Lovejoy.</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>We all know the one thing we won't need in the future: Left-handed stores.</p>
<p>That's you, Flanders!</p>
<p>I'm terribly sorry. Flanders is the only useless person here.</p>
<p>If anyone dies, it should be him.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. Please forgive me.</p>
<p>So let's kick Flanders out. Sorry.</p>
<p>Well, sir, sounds fair.</p>
<p>Toodle-loo, everybody. I'll scream when the comet gets here.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm coming with you, Neddie.</p>
<p>No, sweetheart.</p>
<p>You... You stay here, because...</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I might go mad with fear out there, so, Todd... I want you to sh**t Daddy if he tries to get back in.</p>
<p>Okay, Dad.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hey, I got an idea.</p>
<p>We can play a game to pass the time.</p>
<p>I'll make the sound of a barnyard animal, and you all try to guess what it is.</p>
<p>It's a pig.</p>
<p>It's a cow, man.</p>
<p>It's a pony.</p>
<p>No, it's a goat.</p>
<p>You know, one of them lady goats.</p>
<p>There are no lady goats.</p>
<p>A lady goat is a sheep.</p>
<p>I believe she's right.</p>
<p>You're crazy.</p>
<p>What's it to you?</p>
<p>What's it to me?</p>
<p>Hey, it's a pony!</p>
<p>Shut up!</p>
<p>Doesn't anybody care that I'm hungry?</p>
<p>Stop it, stop it. Can't you see this barnyard-noise guessing game... is tearing us apart?</p>
<p>Say, Moe, was it a duck?</p>
<p>I don't like it...</p>
<p>No! No! Shut up! Shut up! Stop it! Stop it!</p>
<p>I can't take this anymore.</p>
<p>I can't let that brave man out there die alone.</p>
<p>I'm surprised and disgusted by all of you.</p>
<p>Especially his children.</p>
<p>I'm going out there.</p>
<p>And it was a baby ox.</p>
<p>He's right, you know.</p>
<p>About the ox?</p>
<p>About everything, damn it! Hey, Homer, wait up. I wanna die too.</p>
<p>If you are going, I am going.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>I'm out of here. Make way.</p>
<p>Radio reception in there sucked.</p>
<p>Run!</p>
<p>Look!</p>
<p>It's breaking up!</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>We're saved!</p>
<p>Sure makes you appreciate the preciousness of life.</p>
<p>Let's go burn down the observatory so this'll never happen again.</p>
<p>I can't believe that extra-thick layer of pollution that I've picketed against... is what b*rned up the comet.</p>
<p>What's really amazing... is that this is exactly what Dad said would happen.</p>
<p>Yeah. Dad was right.</p>
<p>I know, kids. I'm scared too.</p>
