<p>[CHUCKLES] Sort of.    </p>
<p>Let me get you some coffee.    </p>
<p>Mister, you owe my dad a fortune.    </p>
<p>'Fraid not. Your Dad never signed his contract.    </p>
<p>You think I left millions on the table?    </p>
<p>That doesn't sound like me.    </p>
<p>- Hundreds of millions.<br />
- That sounds like me.    </p>
<p>Everything was going great.    </p>
<p>Then you ran out of the photo session.    </p>
<p>I didn't even know your name till this week.    </p>
<p>Run away from a fake battle?<br />
Oh, I would never do that.    </p>
<p>Oh, yeah? Our photographer, Philip Hefflin, could barely finish the session.    </p>
<p>Philip Hefflin?    </p>
<p>Yes. The finest w*r and fashion photographer    </p>
<p>- I ever knew.<br />
- [GRAMPA GASPS]    </p>
<p>I remember Philip.    </p>
<p>He smelled of developing fluid and Aqua Velva.    </p>
<p>We have flashback, people.    </p>
<p>[&quot;BLUE RONDO À LA TURK&quot; BY THE DAVE BRUBECK QUARTET PLAYING]    </p>
<p>Thank you. This is the most fun I've had    </p>
<p>since not dying in the w*r.    </p>
<p>You're my kind of man, if you know what I mean.    </p>
<p>That's not what I meant!    </p>
<p>I'm sorry. I thought you wanted me to...    </p>
<p>This is the '  s. Guys like you don't exist.    </p>
<p>We'll just finish the session.    </p>

<p>We found out what happened and we fired Philip.    </p>
<p>- For kissing an employee?<br />
- No, for being gay.    </p>
<p>That's just what you did in the good old days.    </p>
<p>Grampa, is that true... you ruined a man's career?    </p>
<p>[CRIES] And all he was doing was expressing his love for me.    </p>

<p>where our motto is &quot;What's the point of going anywhere?&quot;    </p>
<p>That poor man. I'll never know what happened to him.    </p>
<p>According to Cyber Stalker.com, he now lives in a small town in Texas.    </p>
<p>Texas? That's where my friend Louisiana Joe is from.    </p>
<p>MARGE: Marfa, Texas.    </p>
<p>Why don't you go see him and clear your conscience?    </p>
<p>Plus, I always wanted to visit Texas. It's open carry.    </p>
<p>Oh, what do I do?    </p>
<p>If I go see him, he might punch me in the kisser,    </p>
<p>- or kiss me in the puncher.<br />

<p>Abe, promise me one thing.    </p>
<p>Go see Philip. Tell him you're sorry.    </p>
<p>Then find my girl and tell her I loved her.    </p>
<p>Find the milkman and tell him one less milk.    </p>
<p>Then find Branch Rickey and tell him to integrate baseball.    </p>
<p>I have to go to Texas.    </p>
<p>- Well, you're not going alone.<br />

<p>PHILIP: Hello, Abe.    </p>
<p>You've aged well, like a fine onion.    </p>
<p>I hope you can forgive what I did to you.    </p>
<p>I'm sorry I ruined your life.    </p>
<p>Ruined my life? You saved it.    </p>
<p>- I saved it?<br />
- Let me explain.    </p>
<p>After I lost my job,    </p>
<p>I decided I'd never live anything but my truth again.    </p>
<p><em>My wife took it well.</em>    </p>
<p>I hit the road and drove as far as I could.    </p>
<p>I landed here and I've never had a day of regret since.    </p>
<p>What's the matter?    </p>
<p>You're such a wonderful guy.    </p>
<p>Maybe it was my life that was ruined that day.    </p>
<p>It's never too late, Abe.    </p>
<p>Never too late to find out what your true self is.    </p>
<p>A paper at Cornell University    </p>
<p>has showed that no one is    % straight or gay.    </p>
<p>- Is it peer reviewed?<br />
- Does it matter?    </p>
<p>Ah, I'm afraid I'm too old to try anything new.    </p>
<p>I miss the days when circuses had elephants    </p>
<p>and they stomped on people.    </p>
<p>And don't get me started on<em> Young Sheldon.</em>    </p>
<p>Understood, but before you go,    </p>
<p>we never did finish that photo session.    </p>
<p>[&quot;BLUE RONDO À LA TURK&quot; BY THE DAVE BRUBECK QUARTET PLAYING]    </p>
<p>It's a sh*t I always wanted and never got:    </p>
<p>your beautiful smile.    </p>
<p>Why didn't you say so?    </p>
<p>I'll leave that with you.    </p>
<p>Enjoy your life.    </p>
<p>The Alamo's not the only thing I'm gonna remember.    </p>
<p>Well?    </p>
<p>Sorry, my friend, this army man is as straight as Gomer Pyle.    </p>
<p>[LAUGHS]    </p>
<p>Good for you, soldier.    </p>
<p>You learned that army men come in all orientations,    </p>
<p>but we're all molded from the same crappy plastic.    </p>
<p>Permission to pair up, sir?    </p>
<p>Granted.    </p>
