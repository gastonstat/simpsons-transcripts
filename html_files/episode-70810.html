<p>Second grade is a turbulent time.  </p>
<p>In gym, I was given a &quot;C&quot;  </p>
<p>when I refused to play<br />
with the non-vegan football.  </p>
<p><em>And so, I was searching for meaning.</em>  </p>
<p><em>And extra credit.</em>  </p>
<p>I found it in the Future Nature<br />
Documentarian Day Camp.   </p>
<p><em>I knew two things going in.</em>   </p>
<p><em>I would produce<br />
a three-minute documentary</em>   </p>
<p><em>and lunch would not be provided.</em>   </p>
<p><em>What I didn't know<br />
was that I would become friends</em>   </p>
<p><em>with an eight-armed miracle.</em>   </p>

<p><em>At first, she was shy, like me.</em>   </p>
<p><em>Unlike me, most of her brain cells</em>   </p>
<p><em>are located in her tentacles.</em>   </p>
<p><em>Which can smell, taste and even think.</em>   </p>
<p><em>I named her Molly.</em>   </p>
<p><em>She was the most fascinating creature.</em>   </p>

<p>Mom! I'm recording my voice-over.   </p>
<p>I wasn't expecting to see a shark.   </p>
<p>What if it bit you?   </p>
<p>Quick, let me do a finger count.   </p>
<p>It's a tiny shark.<br />
It's not dangerous to people.   </p>
<p>I don't like you hanging out<br />
with sharks.   </p>
<p>You should have land friends.   </p>

<p>Very impressive.   </p>
<p>You won the Tishman Prize<br />
for Classroom Excellence   </p>
<p>and the Fallberg Prize<br />
for Cloakroom Excellence.   </p>
<p>I invented a new coat hook.   </p>
<p>So, what brings you to Springfield?   </p>
<p>Oh, my husband was hired by the<br />
Springfield Symphony Orchestra.   </p>
<p>He's an oboist. He's not great.   </p>
<p>But that-that was unsupportive.   </p>
<p>He's good. Oboe is hard.   </p>
<p>See, for two years I taught in Ghana,   </p>
<p>which was so rewarding,<br />
but not so much for him.   </p>
<p>Ghana doesn't have an orchestra?   </p>
<p>Well, they do, but you have to<br />
be really good to play in it...   </p>
<p>Ooh, n-not that Springfield isn't good.   </p>
<p>It is a fine regional orchestra,<br />
and-and my husband   </p>
<p>fits right in.   </p>
<p>(LAUGHS)   </p>
<p>Anyway, that's why we're here.   </p>
<p>Uh, uh, would you, uh,<br />
excuse us for one moment?   </p>
<p>Oh, uh, c-certainly.   </p>
<p>CHALMERS: Yes. An actual<br />
qualified teacher.   </p>
<p>SKINNER: And she's stuck here<br />
because her husband sucks at oboe.   </p>
<p>- CHALMERS: Ha!<br />
- SKINNER: Booyah!   </p>
<p>(CLEARS THROAT) Um...   </p>
<p>obviously, we're meeting<br />
with other applicants...   </p>
<p>Of course, and I'm meeting<br />
with other schools.   </p>
<p>No! You're hired, you're hired.   </p>
<p>Here's a ninety, uh, three<br />
dollar signing bonus.   </p>
<p>And you can have his parking spot.   </p>
<p>I'll park at the yogurt place.<br />
They-they know me there.   </p>
<p>(GASPS)   </p>
<p>Are-are you okay?   </p>
<p>Boys, meet your new teacher, Ms. Peyton.   </p>
<p>This is Nelson, Milhouse and...   </p>
<p>w-who is that behind that locker?   </p>
<p>Just me. Bart.   </p>
<p>Bart. Bart. (LAUGHS)   </p>
<p>You know, like a seal?   </p>
<p>You look familiar. Have we met?   </p>
<p>(ROBOTIC): No! You are a stranger.   </p>
<p>Stranger, stranger,<br />

<p>(HIGH-PITCHED):<br />
Shutting down. Self-destruct.   </p>
<p>(IMITATES expl*si*n, WHISTLING)   </p>
<p>Bart had Skittles<br />

<p><em>Molly tried to armor herself<br />
against the predator.</em>   </p>
<p>But it wasn't enough.   </p>
<p>As a filmmaker, all I could do<br />
was watch in horror   </p>
<p><em>and rack focus on the shark.</em>   </p>
<p>I hope I made a difference<br />

<p>Oh, Lisa, your movie<br />
was so sad and beautiful.   </p>
<p>That poor<em> octomapus.</em>   </p>
<p>Your movie really makes you think about   </p>
<p>the wondrous creature beneath the batter   </p>
<p>and the marinara sauce and the...   </p>
<p>(DROOLS)    </p>
<p>Mmm, Lisa's friend.    </p>
<p>I think I need some time alone.    </p>
<p>- Of course.<br />
- Oh, sweetie, whatever you need.    </p>
<p>(GIGGLING)    </p>
<p>I won an award!    </p>
<p>Well, actually,<br />
<em>we</em> won an award. (LAUGHS)    </p>
<p>You want to watch it again?    </p>
<p>(LISA GRUNTS)    </p>
<p>I know, I broke the code and interfered.    </p>
<p>Maybe I should give back the trophy.    </p>
<p>Or we could do that. Problem solved.    </p>
<p>You're so smart.    </p>
<p>(SIGHS)    </p>
<p>Be patient.    </p>
<p>They may test you at first,<br />
but it's only because    </p>
<p>of their terribly sad home lives.    </p>
<p>Hello, teachers.<br />
My name is Rayshelle Peyton.    </p>
<p>This is my first day,<br />
so you'll have to tell me    </p>
<p>all the inside jokes.    </p>
<p>(GRUNTS) I have a ruptured disk,<br />
but I can't afford to stay home.    </p>
<p>(LAUGHS) I can't wait to hear<br />
the story behind that.    </p>
<p>- Huh?<br />
- Show of hands,    </p>
<p>who here is familiar    </p>
<p>with project-based learning?    </p>
<p>The reason I ask:<br />
my last school did a project    </p>
<p>where each grade built a model    </p>
<p>of one of the New Seven Wonders<br />
of the World,    </p>
<p>and for the next month, all subjects...    </p>
<p>Math, art, history and science...    </p>
<p>Were taught by designing<br />
and building the project.    </p>
<p>If you're undecided, I've got<br />
a much longer presentation.    </p>
<p>Let me grab my puppets.    </p>
<p>Look, whatever is making<br />
all this happen,    </p>
<p>either adjust the dosage or share.    </p>
<p>Oh, I get it.    </p>
<p>You don't want to abandon the lessons    </p>
<p>you've already carefully prepared    </p>
<p>to follow these step-by-step plans.    </p>
<p>The lessons are already written out?    </p>
<p>This is like the HelloFresh of teaching.    </p>
<p>I can be on cruise control for a month.    </p>
<p>I'm second grade. What are we making?    </p>
<p>- Chichen Itza.<br />
- Great.    </p>
<p>I'll start by finding out what that is.    </p>
<p>These self-portraits are gonna<br />
help me get to know you better.    </p>
<p>This way, I get to see you<br />
the way you see you.    </p>
<p><em>Wow.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Classic compulsive overachiever.</em>    </p>
<p>Relax, this isn't being graded.    </p>
<p>I mean, A+.    </p>
<p>(SIGHS)    </p>
<p>Uh, this is me b*at up<br />
Santa until he's my dad.    </p>
<p>Ah.    </p>
<p><em>Okay, violent,</em>    </p>
<p><em>but he cares about holidays and family.</em>    </p>
<p><em>I can work with this.</em>    </p>
<p>That's a lot of glue.    </p>
<p>How is that part of your self-portrait?    </p>
<p>Uh, um, uh... because, you know, uh...    </p>
<p>m-my-my face always has,<br />
u-uh, glue on it.    </p>
<p>Oh. Really?    </p>
<p>Yeah, see? (GRUNTS)    </p>
<p>(LOW-PITCHED): I am glue-face.    </p>
<p>I have slept for a thousand years.    </p>
<p>- (GRUNTS) Ow.<br />
- PEYTON: Oh!    </p>
<p>(LOW-PITCHED VOICE): That did not hurt.    </p>
<p>Take me to your principal, I... Oh!    </p>
<p>Glue-face want door.    </p>
<p>Glue-face need restroom.    </p>
<p><em>PEYTON: What the hell<br />
is wrong with this kid?</em>    </p>
<p>(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)    </p>
<p>Dude, what are you doing in there?    </p>
<p>I know it's not a sidekick's place<br />
to give notes,    </p>
<p>but for the past few weeks,    </p>
<p>nothing's landing.    </p>
<p>Really? I thought milk-nose<br />
glitter sneeze landed.    </p>
<p>No. It did not land.    </p>
<p>- Really hard to look at.<br />
- You don't seem in control.    </p>
<p>We can't laugh at your clowning<br />
if we're concerned about you.    </p>
<p>Why are you messing with Ms. Peyton?    </p>
<p>She's nice.    </p>
<p>I don't know why I do stuff, okay?    </p>
<p>I don't know why I'm yelling now!    </p>
<p>I'm not gonna noogie you,    </p>
<p>but when you think<br />
about your actions today,    </p>
<p>I hope you noogie yourself.    </p>
<p>(BART GROANS)    </p>
<p>(GASPS) How'd you do that?    </p>
<p>Wait, no. What are you do...    </p>
<p>No. No, no. Don't do that.    </p>
<p>No, no, no. (SCREAMS)    </p>
<p>(MOANS) There's supposed to be<br />
a Krazy Krusty Ball in here.    </p>
<p>- (GASPS)<br />
- Huh.    </p>
<p>That is a crazy ball.    </p>
<p>Uh, can I have it?    </p>
<p>- Sure. Think fast.<br />
- No, don't.    </p>
<p>Oh, you inked.    </p>
<p>Oh.    </p>
<p>Uh, you might not want<br />
to eat that cereal.    </p>
<p>Hmm? Why not?    </p>
<p>Uh, no reason. No.    </p>
<p>I'm just gonna go google<br />
some toxicology stuff.    </p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)    </p>
<p>Kids love Google.    </p>
<p><em>BART: Huh, using an X-Acto kn*fe</em>    </p>

<p>(SHOUTS)    </p>
<p>This Friday, there's an assembly<br />
to present the Seven Wonders.    </p>
<p>Your parents will be there,    </p>
<p>and they'll judge me<br />
based on what you do.    </p>
<p>But no pressure.    </p>
<p>Well, a little pressure. (CHUCKLES)    </p>
<p>Pressure makes diamonds.    </p>
<p>Anyway, take your projects out<br />
and get to work, please.    </p>
<p>Milhouse, I love how<br />
you carved the Styrofoam    </p>
<p>to make it look like stones.    </p>
<p>I used an X-Acto kn*fe.    </p>
<p>Bart. What's wrong?    </p>
<p>I didn't mean to do that.    </p>
<p>Great work, Milhouse.    </p>
<p>I meant to do this.    </p>
<p>- Bart.<br />
- I lost my fingerprints gluing that.    </p>
<p>We had to go to urgent care.    </p>
<p>I saw a drug addict!    </p>
<p>(BART WHIMPERS)    </p>

<p>Uh, uh, you don't have to say<br />
nice stuff about Bart.    </p>
<p>- We know the drill.<br />
- Okay, good.    </p>
<p>Just tell us what's wrong with him.    </p>
<p>To be honest, I'm not sure.    </p>

on their teacher.    </p>
<p>Someone has a big crush on being wrong.    </p>
<p>Come on, boy, open up to me. I get it.    </p>
<p>I was in love with my school nurse.    </p>
<p>I would hurt myself on purpose<br />
just to see her.    </p>
<p>I'd fall off the monkey bars,<br />
bash my head into a wall,    </p>
<p>and sometimes I'd even<br />
fall off the monkey bars.    </p>
<p>Actually, there is something<br />
I'm dealing with right now.    </p>
<p>- My dad's an idiot.<br />
- Listen, you little...    </p>
<p>I had brilliant advice<br />
for how to handle a crush.    </p>
<p>But now, I'm keeping it to myself.    </p>
<p>I've met her before.    </p>
<p>So? I've met people.    </p>
<p>Lisa, Maggie. Uh... you!    </p>
<p>No, I've met the teacher before.    </p>
<p>I'm opening up to you.    </p>
<p>Oh, okay. Well, go on, son.    </p>
<p>When Lisa was doing her fish movie,    </p>
<p><em>Mom and I would wait on the beach.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Some rich kid left a sand pail<br />
from the fancy hotel.</em>    </p>
<p><em>That bucket was my ticket<br />
to the guests-only pool area.</em>    </p>

<p><em>At first, it was pretty sweet.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Then I tried a fancy dive<br />
off the Tarzan swing.</em>    </p>
<p><em>A belly flop will knock<br />
the wind out of you.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Especially a belly full of hot fudge.</em>    </p>

<em>- I panicked, and suddenly,</em>    </p>
<p><em>I couldn't tread water,<br />
no matter how hard I flailed.</em>    </p>
<p><em>And no one was noticing.</em>    </p>
<p><em>But then...</em>    </p>
<p>(PANTING) Oh, God.    </p>
<p>Are-are you okay?    </p>
<p>WOMAN: What happened?    </p>
<p>(WHISPERING): He can't swim.    </p>
<p>That poor boy.    </p>
<p>Why did you do that? I was fine.    </p>
<p>I'm an amazing swimmer.    </p>
<p>I-I'm, I'm sorry, I-I thought that...    </p>
<p>I feel awful.    </p>
<p>She ruined her dress<br />
and I yelled at her.    </p>
<p>And my hand went in her mouth<br />
for a second.    </p>
<p>She doesn't recognize me, yet.    </p>
<p>But when she does, she's gonna hate me.    </p>
<p>Every day I tell myself to be invisible.    </p>
<p>Next thing I know,<br />
I'm standing on my desk,    </p>
<p>pretending to poop out<br />
the class hamster.    </p>
<p>HOMER: Hmm.    </p>
<p>What if you told her the...<br />
whatchamacallit?    </p>
<p>- The truth?<br />
- Yeah, that thing.    </p>
<p>You're right.<br />
If it were out in the open,    </p>
<p>she'd have nothing on me.    </p>
<p>Wow, you actually helped.    </p>
<p>I did. You know what?    </p>
<p>I think I'm finally ready to be a dad.    </p>
