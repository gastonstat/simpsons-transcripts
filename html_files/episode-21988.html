							<p>Who sh*t Mr. Burns? (Part One)</p>
<p>Is there nothing so intoxicating as the school hallway at early morn?</p>
<p>The school normally doesn't smell so rank.</p>
<p>Washbasin fresh. That funk must be coming from one of the classrooms.</p>
<p>Poor fellow. Crushed by his own water bottle.</p>
<p>Willie, sometime over the holiday weekend, the beloved grade-four gerbil... Superdude, lost his life.</p>
<p>I need you to air out the classroom and give Superdude a proper burial.</p>
<p>You're lucky you're getting a decent burial.</p>
<p>Me own father got thrown in the bog.</p>
<p>What in the name of Saint Ephesiocritus...?</p>
<p>What reeks?</p>
<p>Smells like one of van Houten's.</p>
<p>It does not.</p>
<p>Miss Hoover, the floor is shaking.</p>
<p>Ralph, remember the time you thought the...?</p>
<p>Now, before we adjourn, I have one last matter of utmost importance.</p>
<p>I need to send this parcel with the profit projections to Pete Porter in Pasadena.</p>
<p>And it absolutely, positively, has to be there overnight.</p>
<p>Pete Porter. Pass it on.</p>
<p>Pasadena. Promptly.</p>
<p>Package parcel processing.</p>
<p>Perk up. Package of plant profit projection for Pete Porter in Pasadena.</p>
<p>Priority?</p>
<p>Precisely.</p>
<p>Here's your package, Mr. Burns.</p>
<p>My name is the return address, you senseless dunderpate.</p>
<p>Smithers, who is this nincompoop?</p>
<p>I've worked here for 10 years and my boss doesn't even know my name.</p>
<p>Well, that's gonna change right now.</p>
<p>My name is Homer J. Simp... son.</p>
<p>Sounded large when I ordered it.</p>
<p>I can't make hide nor hair of these metric booby traps.</p>
<p>My Lord. Such destruction.</p>
<p>Superintendent Chalmers. How are you going?</p>
<p>Why is it when I heard the word &quot;school&quot; and the word &quot;exploded&quot;... I thought of the word &quot;Skinner&quot;?!</p>
<p>Congratulations, gentlemen. Your custodian struck oil.</p>
<p>You're standing on top of the richest elementary school in the state.</p>
<p>We also found this.</p>
<p>Thank you. Superdude.</p>
<p>A nonprofit organization with oil? I won't allow it.</p>
<p>An oil well doesn't belong in the hands of... Betsy Bleeding-heart and Maynard G. Muskie-vote.</p>
<p>Sir, have you had enough exercise for this morning?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Let's do another 20 miles.</p>
<p>Hello, Lenny, Carl, Guillermo. Hello...</p>
<p>Don't take it so hard, Homer. He's always screwing up people's names.</p>
<p>At the picnic, he thought my son Reynaldo was Rolando.</p>
<p>Can you believe it?</p>
<p>Superintendent, we made the front page today.</p>
<p>What's that say under your hand there?</p>
<p>Oh, it's an unrelated article.</p>
<p>It's an unrelated article.</p>
<p>Within the banner headline.</p>
<p>Yes. Now, to redirect our conversation... I have ideas on spending this oil money.</p>
<p>Well, we could give each student a full college scholarship.</p>
<p>Oh, mercy.</p>
<p>Before we draw up the budget... the students and faculty have a few suggestions.</p>
<p>I want a crystal bucket for my slop water. And a brand-new filthy blanket.</p>
<p>The cafeteria staff is complaining about the mice in the kitchen.</p>
<p>I wanna hire a new staff.</p>
<p>I'd like to start a jazz program in the music department.</p>
<p>We've got a great instructor lined up.</p>
<p>Tito Puente!</p>
<p>Tito Puente!</p>
<p>He's ready to give up the professional mambo circuit... and settle into a nice teaching job.</p>
<p>Man, it would be my pleasure.</p>
<p>Lisa has told me all your students are as bright and dedicated to jazz as she is.</p>
<p>Let's go now, Mr. Puente.</p>
<p>Chocolate microscopes.</p>
<p>You know those guitars that are, like, double guitars, you know?</p>
<p>More rubber stamps.</p>
<p>Principal Skinner, this is your secretary. One last student to see you.</p>
<p>That's odd. I don't have a secretary.</p>
<p>Or an intercom. But send them in.</p>
<p>Ahoy there, dean. I understand you're taking suggestions from students, eh?</p>
<p>Well, me and my fourth-form chums think it would be quite corking... if you'd sign over your oil well to the local energy concern.</p>
<p>Mr. Burns...</p>
<p>It's naive of you to think I'd mistake this town's... most prominent 104-year-old man for an elementary school student.</p>
<p>I want that oil well. I've got a monopoly to maintain.</p>
<p>I own the electric company, waterworks, plus the hotel on Baltic Avenue.</p>
<p>That hotel's a dump and your monopoly's pathetic.</p>
<p>The oil well is not for sale, particularly to a black-hearted scoundrel like yourself.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Then I'll just have to attack you. I must have that oil.</p>
<p>Smithers. Smithers, help me subdue this beast.</p>
<p>Sorry, sir. This was all I could find. Take that. And that.</p>
<p>Please don't waste those.</p>
<p>I'm happy for the school.</p>
<p>Sounds like this money is gonna provide new opportunities.</p>
<p>Big deal. They didn't approve my idea. Said it was unfeasible.</p>
<p>It is unfeasible to resurrect the dead, Bart.</p>
<p>And even if the Three Stooges were alive, I doubt they'd hang out with you.</p>
<p>I guess they'd wanna be with their families or something, huh?</p>
<p>Oh, I hate my job.</p>
<p>What's the point when your boss doesn't even remember your name?</p>
<p>I have an idea.</p>
<p>What? What's your idea?</p>
<p>When my father was trying to catch my mother's eye... he sent her a box of candy with his photo.</p>
<p>After that, she never forgot him.</p>
<p>That's all well and good.</p>
<p>But it's not really your idea, is it, now, Marge?</p>
<p>That's it. Frimble about with your widgets and doobobs.</p>
<p>It will all be a monument to futility when my plan comes to fruition.</p>
<p>Sir.</p>
<p>What I'm about to say violates every sycophantic urge in my body... but I wish you'd reconsider. This isn't a rival company... it's a school. They won't stand for it.</p>
<p>Pishposh.</p>
<p>It will be like taking candy from a baby.</p>
<p>Say, that sounds like a &quot;larf.&quot;</p>
<p>Let's try it right now.</p>
<p>There's candy right here. Why don't we eat this instead of stealing.</p>
<p>Oh, very well.</p>
<p>Oh, look. There's a photo in here.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>That's little Maggie Simpson, the baby who found my teddy bear Bobo.</p>
<p>And there's that Simpson mutt, my former guard dog.</p>
<p>And that's Bart Simpson. He was my heir for a brief period, you know.</p>
<p>Yes, sir. I remember.</p>
<p>Anything left?</p>
<p>Only the sour quince log, sir.</p>
<p>Dispose of it.</p>
<p>And send a thank-you note to Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.</p>
<p>Today, Springfield Elementary embarks on a new era of... unbridled spending where petrodollars fuel our wildest educational fantasies.</p>
<p>These young minds will enjoy every academic advantage... till they enter Springfield High School, which has no oil well.</p>
<p>We got an air hockey table.</p>
<p>Fine. Now, to switch on our oil pump... for the very first time, here's our top student, Lisa Simpson.</p>
<p>Nerd!</p>
<p>There's no pressure.</p>
<p>Someone else has tapped this well.</p>
<p>Ay caramba!</p>
<p>Soon that mighty apparatus will burst forth with its precious fluid.</p>
<p>Almost sexual, isn't it, Smithers?</p>
<p>Oil ho!</p>
<p>Huzzah!</p>
<p>Holy Christmas!</p>

<p>Your dog's condition has been upgraded from stable to frisky.</p>
<p>He's free to go. His leg should be good as new in a few months.</p>
<p>In the meantime, he'll have to use the wheel-about.</p>
<p>I'll get even with whoever did this to you, boy. I swear it.</p>
<p>I almost forgot. Wouldn't want you gnawing on those casts, eh, boy?</p>
<p>We've got no legal recourse against Mr. Burns' slant-drilling operation.</p>
<p>The oil belongs to whoever pumped it first.</p>
<p>What about the expensive stuff we wanted? Can we still have it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Blast it!</p>
<p>To pay for the construction, operation and demolition of the derrick... we have to cut nonessential programs. Music...</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>And maintenance.</p>
<p>I'll k*ll that Mr. Burns!</p>
<p>And wound that Mr. Smithers. Out of my way.</p>
<p>Oh, no. That's awful, Mr. Puente.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>He owns the nuclear power plant. Yeah, I'd like to settle his hash too.</p>
<p>Dad, how can you work for a man like Mr. Burns?</p>
<p>He's not all bad. He did send me this nice thank-you card.</p>
<p>&quot;Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie.&quot; Dad, this doesn't have your name on it.</p>
<p>Kids, would you step outside for a second?</p>
<p>Dear Lord. That's the loudest profanity I've ever heard.</p>
<p>These fumes aren't as fun as beer. Sure, I'm all dizzy and nauseous... but where's the inflated sense of self-esteem?</p>
<p>Hey, if you guys are getting loaded off them fumes, I'll have to charge you.</p>
<p>Man alive! There are men alive in here.</p>
<p>I'm detecting over 20 different toxins in the air.</p>
<p>Everybody out. As long as Burns is pumping oil, this bar is closed.</p>
<p>Damn Burns. Let me just get one thing.</p>
<p>Me too. Now, there's the inflated sense of self-esteem.</p>
<p>Earthquake!</p>
<p>Nurse!</p>
<p>Nurse! Nurse!</p>
<p>Well, sir, you've vanquished all your enemies.</p>
<p>The elementary school, local tavern, the old-age home. You must be proud.</p>
<p>No, not while my greatest nemesis still provides our customers... with free light, heat and energy.</p>
<p>I call this enemy... the sun.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of time, man has yearned to destroy the sun.</p>
<p>I will do the next best thing: Block it out.</p>
<p>Good God!</p>
<p>Imagine it, Smithers.</p>
<p>Electrical lights and heaters running all day long.</p>
<p>But, sir, every plant and tree will die.</p>
<p>Owls will deafen us with incessant hooting. The sundial will be useless.</p>
<p>I don't want any part of this project. It's unconscionably fiendish.</p>
<p>I won't suffer your insubordination.</p>
<p>There has been a shocking decline in the quality and quantity of your toadying.</p>
<p>And you will fall into line. Now!</p>
<p>No. No, Monty, I won't.</p>
<p>Not until you step back from the brink of insanity.</p>
<p>I'll do no such thing. You're fired.</p>
<p>Take that, Bowl-a-rama. Take that, convenience mart.</p>
<p>Take that, nuclear power pla...</p>
<p>Oh, fiddlesticks.</p>
<p>I must say, Mr. Burns is being awfully inconsiderate. Selfish, even.</p>
<p>Burns needs some serious &quot;boostafazoo.&quot; Right, Dad?</p>
<p>Dad. Homer.</p>
<p>Sorry, Grampa. It's just, for a second, it looked like Dad had melted.</p>
<p>Well, get used to it, because I'm living here now.</p>
<p>I ain't going back to the home until they fish my bed out of that sinkhole.</p>
<p>Strained carrots for Maggie. Strained carrots for Grampa.</p>
<p>I want a bib too.</p>
<p>Smithers, who is that ignoramus? Smithers, who is that lollygagger?</p>
<p>Who is that blubber-pot? Who is that bafflewit?</p>
<p>Lummox. Puddinghead. Mooncalf. Limpnoodle.</p>
<p>Goldbricker. Drizzlepuss...</p>
<p>Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!</p>
<p>Look out!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Just a minute.</p>
<p>Who the devil are you?</p>
<p>Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>What? What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>Make sense, man.</p>
<p>I can't understand a word you're saying.</p>
<p>My name is Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>Oh, you're a dead man, Burns. Oh, you're dead. You're dead, Burns!</p>
<p>Hey, the lamp's running away.</p>
<p>That's my dog, man.</p>
<p>So long, lamp. Now, stop loafing and help your Grampa unpack.</p>
<p>That's my old Smith &amp; Wesson.</p>
<p>If you're gonna play with it, be careful. It's loaded.</p>
<p>Bart, put that down!</p>
<p>g*n are dangerous. And I won't have them in this house.</p>
<p>How can you have a house without a g*n?</p>
<p>What if a bear came through the door?</p>
<p>I'm going to bury it in the yard where little hands can't get to it.</p>
<p>You should've fired into the air. She would've run off.</p>
<p>People, take it easy.</p>
<p>We're all upset about Mr. Burns' plan to block out our sun.</p>
<p>It is time for decisive action.</p>
<p>I have here a polite but firm letter to Mr. Burns' underlings... who, with some cajoling, will pass it along to him... or at least give him the gist of it.</p>
<p>Sir, a lot of people are stroking g*n.</p>
<p>It has been brought to my attention a number of you are stroking g*n.</p>
<p>Therefore I'll step aside and open up the floor.</p>
<p>Mr. Burns was the closest thing I ever had to a friend.</p>
<p>But he fired me.</p>
<p>And now I spend my days drinking cheap Scotch and watching Comedy Central.</p>
<p>Oh, dear God.</p>
<p>It's not that bad. I mean... I never miss Pardon My Zinger.</p>
<p>Burns cost me my groundskeeping job at the school.</p>
<p>And I'm too superstitious to take the one at the cemetery.</p>
<p>Because of him, I lost my room... my things and my buddy's collection of old sunbathing magazines.</p>
<p>You bastard.</p>
<p>I lost my bar.</p>
<p>I lost his bar.</p>
<p>He robbed the school of music.</p>
<p>He robbed it of financial security.</p>
<p>He robbed the school of Tito.</p>
<p>He can't remember my name!</p>
<p>He's causing us all to yell!</p>
<p>Look what he did to my best friend.</p>
<p>No, my dog.</p>
<p>Those wheels are squeaking a bit.</p>
<p>Perhaps I could sell him a little oil.</p>
<p>You twisted old monster!</p>
<p>I've decided to protect myself... ever since I was attacked in my office by an unidentified assailant.</p>
<p>Burns, your scurvy schemes will earn ye a one-way passage to the boneyard.</p>
<p>I'd like to hear from Sideshow Mel.</p>
<p>I'll see that Mr. Burns suffers the infernal machinations of hell's grim tyrant.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, you all talk big.</p>
<p>But who here has the guts to stop me?</p>
<p>Very well. One last question.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen the sun set at 3 p. M?</p>
<p>Once, when I was sailing around the Arctic...</p>
<p>Shut up, you. Take one last look at the sun, Springfield.</p>
<p>Hey, hey!</p>
<p>I've been in Reno for six weeks. Did I miss anything?</p>
<p>What the...?</p>
<p>Eternal darkness. Well, that's just great.</p>
<p>Listen, someone's got to get that Mr. Burns.</p>
<p>Where's a g*n lowlife when you need one?</p>
<p>Sorry, I was in the can.</p>
<p>Perpetual twilight. Bathed in the glow of Burns brand electricity.</p>
<p>Hello, lamppost. What you knowing?</p>
<p>I've come to watch your power flowing.</p>
<p>That's odd. Mr. Smithers left his jacket behind.</p>
<p>That's odd. Principal Skinner left his mother behind.</p>
<p>That's odd. Where's Homer? And Bart? And Lisa? And Grampa?</p>
<p>After all these years, things are finally starting to go my way.</p>
<p>I feel like celebrating.</p>
<p>Oh, it's you. What are you so happy about?</p>
<p>I see. I think you'd better drop it.</p>
<p>I said, drop it!</p>
<p>Get your hands off.</p>
<p>Where is everybody?</p>
<p>Hey, man. Are you okay?</p>
<p>Won't... dignify that... with a response.</p>
<p>Mr. Burns has been sh*t.</p>
<p>Just a minute. This isn't Mr. Burns at all.</p>
