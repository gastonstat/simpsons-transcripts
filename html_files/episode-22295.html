<p>(TIRES SCREECHING)</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>(BRAKES SCREECHING)</p>
<p>(SCREAMS)</p>
<p>(SIGHING CONTENTEDLY)</p>
<p>And so in summary, there are only two real commandments, and the other eight are just filler.</p>
<p>I knew it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And now I have some exciting news.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we'll be blessed with a visit from the highest ranking clergyman of our Presbylutheran faith, His Holiness, the Parson!</p>
<p>(ALL CHATTERING EX CITEDLY)</p>
<p>The Parson? He's coming here?</p>
<p>(SCREAMING LIKE A GIRL)</p>
<p>Oh, my God! She fainted! Let's go get smelling salts.</p>
<p>(CAR REVVING)</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Suckers!</p>
<p>Springfielders have camped out all night to get a glimpse of the most saintly person to visit our town since Mother Teresa stopped here to gas up her Vespa.</p>
<p>And I'm selling all sorts of faith-based knickknacks.</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Let's take a look.</p>
<p>I'd commit arson for the parson.</p>
<p>Clergymen can kiss my apse.</p>
<p>All kinds of gems.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, none of them have sold. Except for this one.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)</p>
<p>There you have it. News has never been softer.</p>
<p>What's that? The Parson is here!</p>
<p>(CAR HONKING <em>LA CUCARACHA)</em></p>
<p>Oh, my God! It's him!</p>
<p>The earthly embodiment of the elected chair of the National Congress of Deacons!</p>
<p>Well, well, well. Hello, everybody.</p>
<p>I hope you didn't go to all this trouble for little old me.</p>
<p>Parson! Parson! Give us a quick official church position on family.</p>
<p>Well, in these modern times, family is more important than ever.</p>
<p>You just made my moustache tingle.</p>
<p>Settle. Settle down.</p>
<p>Now, now. I am just a man like any other, that has been chosen by God.</p>
<p>I have come here from our world spiritual headquarters in Michigan City, Indiana, to say, keep up the good work.</p>
<p>(ALL CHEERING)</p>
<p>And now if you'll excuse me, I'll do a little speakin' with your deacon.</p>
<p>(ALL LAUGHING)</p>
<p>(SINGING) <em>I love to go to church it's where I like to be.</p>
<p>I get a day in of praying And still tee off by three</em></p>
<p>Calm down, Tim.</p>
<p>He's just your old roommate from Texas Christian.</p>
<p>He's like the pope of this thing!</p>
<p>This would be like Mary Kay visiting you when you were selling her cosmetics!</p>
<p>That is, if you had stuck with it.</p>
<p>You asked me to quit because I was making more than you.</p>
<p>Not now. He's here.</p>
<p>Welcome, Your Holiness.</p>
<p>You'll love what we've done with the church.</p>
<p>There's fresh wax on all the pews.</p>
<p>Sounds to me like somebody put on more than just one coat.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Tim, is there somewhere that we can talk?</p>
<p>Of course. My office.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>(SINGING) <em>Walking to your office ls what I like to do.</p>
<p>Maybe while we're at it We'll peek in at your pews</em></p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>Nilla Wafer?</p>
<p>I'll take two if you don't mind.</p>
<p>Tim, I'm here because of a problem with your last recertification.</p>
<p>When we tried to charge the filing fee to your credit card, it was declined.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>The bank put on a security hold after they saw a charge from an offshore poker club.</p>
<p>Helen had bought a fireplace poker from Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>She says it shifts logs better than American pokers, but I disagree.</p>
<p>We'll get through it. We always do.</p>
<p>Well, love conquers all, huh?</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING)</p>
<p>I remember when she was Helen Schwartzbaum.</p>
<p>In fact, I remember when she was Harold Schwartzbaum.</p>
<p>You what?</p>
<p>I've said too much.</p>
<p>But for the three months it took your card to go through, you weren't certified.</p>
<p>Anything you officiated during that time, funerals, baptisms, even bingo, well, it just didn't count.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING) Well, I'm sure the Lord is understanding.</p>
<p>No, he's not!</p>
<p>I'll notify those affected right away.</p>
<p>(TIM MURMURING)</p>
<p>Tea time.</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>Helen, I was briefly uncertified.</p>
<p>So all those graces you said were a lie?</p>
<p>That food might as well have been regurgitated by Satan himself.</p>
<p>(SINGING) <em>Regurgitated by Satan He couldn't keep it down.</p>
<p>Old 666, he got sick, sick, sick And that's how volcanoes were born</em></p>
<p>Due to a bureaucratic snafu, I wasn't an official minister when we laid your dear Estelle to rest.</p>
<p>So, she's still alive?</p>
<p>I'm afraid not.</p>
<p>Good. Because I left her ashes on the bus.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>So, Captain, when I blessed your vessel, it didn't count.</p>
<p>(EXCLAIMS)</p>
<p>Maybe the next one!</p>
<p>So I'm afraid I wasn't a minister when I blessed your tin roof shanty.</p>
<p>So that's why that ghost keeps a-comin' to the window.</p>
<p><strong>Mailman</strong>: Afternoon.</p>
<p>Fly away, ghostie!</p>
<p>Go back to your haunted cornfield!</p>
<p>Reverend Lovejoy, you deliver pizza now? We didn't order a pizza.</p>
<p>But you forgot the pizza anyway. Marge, the pizza place screwed up again!</p>
<p>You remember when I remarried you two after Homer got that divorce?</p>
<p>Like it was yesterday.</p>
<p>(HUMMING)</p>
<p>Kirk and Luann split up.</p>
<p>So, Homer, fearing we would do the same, preemptively filed for divorce.</p>
<p>But then you re-married us and we were as solid as ever.</p>
<p>And I think Apu got lucky with my sister.</p>
<p>(MARGE SIGHING)</p>
<p>Well, I'm afraid that joyous occasion fell during a time when I wasn't actually a minister.</p>
<p>Since that time, you two have not been legally wed.</p>
<p>You don't get it, <em>Padre.</em> My old lady and I have a thing going on.</p>
<p>We don't need a piece of paper to keep it real.</p>
<p>Who are you calling an old lady?</p>
<p>I need that paper quick!</p>
<p>So, you and Mom aren't married? Does that mean I'm a bastard?</p>
<p>You were born while they were married. So, legally, no.</p>
<p>But in the sense someone calls you one when they're angry, yes.</p>
<p>It's not a big deal.</p>
<p>We'll just go to City Hall and get married there.</p>
<p>I think it's romantic.</p>
<p>You can pretend you're newlyweds starting a life together.</p>
<p>Yeah, instead of exhausted zombies running down the clock.</p>
<p>Why, you little bastard!</p>
<p>That's the angry one.</p>
<p>(MUTTERING ANGRILY)</p>
<p><strong>Moe</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p>(MURMURS SADLY)</p>
<p>This isn't the most romantic place to get married.</p>
<p>Sweetie, any place I'm marrying you is the most romantic place in the world.</p>
<p>Watch your back! Half a corpse coming through!</p>
<p>(SIGHING SADLY)</p>
<p>Marge, this time I'm gonna give you the wedding you deserve.</p>
<p>Let's get out of here.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's the line to get out.</p>
<p>(HOMER MURMURS SADLY)</p>
<p>(HUMMING HAPPILY)</p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p>(PHONE RINGING)</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Hello. It's me, Lance Romance.</p>
<p><em>Your first mission is to look out the window.</em></p>
<p>(GIGGLING)</p>
<p>Whatever you say, Lance.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>(BARNEY GRUNTS)</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p><em><strong>Bill</strong>: This is Bill and Marty saying, '&quot;Marge, go down to the basement. '&quot;</em></p>
<p>(EXCLAIMING)</p>
<p>(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING ON VIOLIN)</p>
<p>Homer, what's going on? The violin, pants with a crease? Why?</p>
<p>Marge, you deserve a wedding day that, unlike our children, was planned in advance.</p>
<p>So, will you marry me in style?</p>
<p>Yes, Homer! Yes!</p>
<p>Did you hear that, Santa? She said yes! Yes!</p>
<p>(LAUGHS HAPPILY)</p>
<p>Now back to your cold, airless tomb.</p>

<p><strong>Santa</strong>: (IN MECHANICAL VOICE) <em>Ho, ho, ho.</em></p>
<p>Oh! It's beautiful.</p>
<p>But that's an awful lot to pay for a dress I'll only wear once.</p>
<p>Marge, a woman only gets one chance at a second remarriage.</p>
<p>The choice is yours.</p>
<p>You can look like a fairy princess or a pig wrapped in rags.</p>
<p>Uh... A princess?</p>
<p>Fine. We'll do it your way.</p>
<p>This one's a little gay, isn't it?</p>
<p>Well, the last time I checked, pirates weren't gay.</p>
<p>(GROANS IN DISGUST) How'd you check?</p>
<p>Check out this rocket ship cake, Marge!</p>
<p>That's for a child's birthday. We're going to get this one.</p>
<p>Maybe we could bury the rocket ship inside the cake.</p>
<p>And that would be a big surprise because I'd forget about it pretty quick.</p>
<p>No rockets! You can pick the frosting.</p>
<p>Chocolate!</p>
<p>We'll take lemon.</p>
<p>Okay, I want white roses at the altar, red roses along the aisle, and blue roses in the centerpieces.</p>
<p>There are no blue roses.</p>
<p>I want to talk to Howard!</p>
<p>Howard died 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Well, did he take all the blue roses with him?</p>
<p>My father was a lovely man.</p>
<p>He took very good care of my mother and me.</p>
<p>All right, people, I want every table to have two baskets of bread but only one plate of butter.</p>
<p>That will stimulate conversation.</p>
<p>What if we...</p>
<p>There is no &quot;we&quot; in wedding!</p>
<p>But there is, Marge. The first two letters.</p>
<p>I can't believe you're ruining the second Thursday before the wedding!</p>
<p>Homer!</p>
<p>(GRUNTING ANGRILY)</p>
<p>I can't believe you told Lenny and Carl they could bring dates.</p>
<p>'Cause they're not even coming to the wedding.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Because their RSVP cards arrived one day after the deadline!</p>
<p>Marge, maybe you should take a break from wedding planning.</p>
<p>I think you're becoming a bridezilla!</p>
<p>Bridezilla?</p>
<p>(GASPS) A combination of bride and Godzilla?</p>
<p>How could you say that? More like you're a King Wrong!</p>
<p>(BOTH GRUNTING)</p>
<p>(GROWLING)</p>
<p>(GROWLING)</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>(HUMMING)</p>
<p>No matter what I do, Marge yells at me.</p>
<p>If she's like this now, what will she be like after we get married?</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Okay! Okay! Everyone, back off! I want to see myself.</p>
<p>A pimple? Not on my day, you don't.</p>
<p>(GRUNTING)</p>
<p>Okay, it's go time. Dim the lights.</p>
<p>Cue the band.</p>
<p><em>(BRIDAL CHORUS</em> PLAYING)</p>
<p>And release the groom!</p>
<p>Homer, that's you!</p>
<p>(GRUNTS ANGRILY)</p>
<p>We are now 11 seconds behind schedule!</p>
<p>Homie?</p>
<p>(CRYING)</p>
<p><em>(WHEN THE SAINTS GO MARCHING IN</em> PLAYING)</p>
<p>(CRYING)</p>
<p>I can't believe Homer left me at the altar.</p>
<p>Marge, have a shrimp puff.</p>
<p>Wipe your tears with a monogrammed napkin.</p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p>I know it is hard, but smile for the cameraman from Gary's Magic Moments.</p>
<p>You have my deepest sympathy.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: What's going on? What's with all the darkness?</p>
<p>Hello? Marge? Where am I?</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>What the... I'm chained up like a common bicycle!</p>
<p>(GRUNTING)</p>
<p>Who would do this to me?</p>
<p>It would have to be someone who could afford a chain.</p>
<p><em><strong>Deep voice on speaker</strong>: You're going to be here awhile.</em></p>
<p>But I have to marry Marge!</p>
<p><em>As of now, your pathetic little life means nothing!</em></p>
<p>Just so you know, you're making a pretty bad first impression!</p>
<p>It's all my fault.</p>
<p>Homer wanted to serve those little cocktail hotdogs.</p>
<p>But, no! I had to have spring rolls!</p>
<p>They taste like nothing.</p>
<p>I don't understand.</p>
<p>Dad would never miss an open bar with chicken wings.</p>
<p>Plus, he loves Mom and us, yadda-yadda-yadda.</p>
<p>Hey, I found something!</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>Sideshow Bob!</p>
<p>Sideshow Bob?</p>
<p>He ruined the wedding, getting his revenge on us at last!</p>
<p>Because he knows that if Mom and Dad don't get married, I'll never be born!</p>
<p>(DOORBELL RINGING)</p>
<p>I've got some wedding registry items for Mrs. Simpson.</p>
<p>I'm afraid I'm just Ms. Simpson now.</p>
<p>Interesting nuance.</p>
<p>I'd like to hear more about it but company policy forbids chitchat.</p>
<p>I miss you so much.</p>
<p><em><strong>Deep voice</strong>: To remove that chain, you need the key to the lock.</em></p>
<p>You idiot. How am I ever gonna find the key to the...</p>
<p>Here it is.</p>
<p>(HOMER EXCLAIMS)</p>
<p>To get the key, I have to lick through a lollipop?</p>
<p>How awful!</p>
<p>(SCREAMING)</p>
<p>What the...</p>
<p><em>The lollipop is made of hot sauce.</em></p>
<p>Oh! Whose side are you on?</p>
<p><em>(LAUGHING EVILL Y)</em></p>
<p>(LAUGHING EVILLY)</p>
<p>Sideshow Bob, drop that kn*fe and give back our dad!</p>
<p>(EXCLAIMS IN CONFUSION)</p>
<p>I'm working on a bust of Krusty and using this kn*fe to aerate the clay.</p>
<p>(GRUNTING)</p>
<p>Anyone for a peppermint tea?</p>
<p>Not for me.</p>
<p>But the monkey needs to keep his strength up.</p>
<p>We're gonna drop him out of a blimp tomorrow and see what happens.</p>
<p>(EXCLAIMS)</p>
<p>Don't worry. Nothing's gonna happen to you, Mr. Teeny number seven.</p>
<p>Bob, did you take any breaks yesterday to kidnap our dad?</p>
<p>Impossible. I was with Bob the whole day!</p>
<p>Then we watched the deluxe DVD of <em>The House of Sand and Fog.</em></p>
<p>At night, we slept in the same bed for warmth.</p>
<p>Then we woke up, had a little nosh, watched <em>The House of Sand and Fog</em> again, with commentary.</p>
<p>The director was an ass.</p>
<p>Fine. But how do you explain this?</p>
<p>Nice of you to think of me. However, &quot;SB&quot; could be anyone.</p>
<p>Scott Baio, the Sultan of Brunei, the former Polish secret police, the Sluzba Bezpieczenstwa. Or...</p>
<p><em>(SOBBING)</p>
<p>(GROANING)</p>
<p>Marge, I miss you!</p>
<p>I miss you so much.</em></p>
<p>Wait till he finds out the key isn't the key, but just a hotter sauce.</p>
<p>(BOTH LAUGHING EVILLY)</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>(BOTH LAUGHING EVILLY)</p>
<p>I'm gonna say this for the last time.</p>
<p>Bart, if this is one of your pranks, very funny.</p>
<p>Maybe we should let him out soon.</p>
<p>Not till Marge dumps him for good.</p>
<p>Hey, lame-o. Ready for some fun with fire ants?</p>
<p>What's fun about fire ants? They're... Oh. You're being sarcastic.</p>
<p><em>Wow. You're the smartest guy in that room.</em></p>
<p>Thank you. That's very... Oh! More sarcasm.</p>
<p>Just see that my fiancée, Marge, gets this, my wedding vows.</p>
<p>&quot;Marge, I hope this day is as perfect for you as the day we met was for me.</p>
<p>&quot;You always find the one grain of sugar in the saltshaker that is I.</p>
<p>&quot;With each marriage, I get a little better.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe after a thousand, I'll be worthy of you.&quot;</p>
<p>I miss you. I miss the kids. God help me, I even miss your sisters!</p>
<p>(BOTH SOBBING)</p>
<p>Poor guy.</p>
<p>He loves her so much.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>But I have been waiting 45 minutes for you to slide my license over to me.</p>
<p>Closed!</p>
<p>Okay, you are hereby banned from my store.</p>
<p>You will have to shop at the Kwik-E-Mart across the street from me!</p>
<p>You know, the much nicer, much newer one.</p>
<p>Good day to you!</p>
<p>Mom! Mom! We know where Dad is.</p>
<p>He's right here.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what happened.</p>
<p>I was kidnapped, then tortured, then I fell into a surprisingly sound sleep.</p>
<p>When I awoke, I felt refreshed.</p>
<p>Then I was blindfolded, and two sobbing trolls threw me out of a van onto our lawn.</p>
<p>I'm just happy you're back.</p>
<p>Now let's get that chain off you.</p>
<p>Won't it dry up in a few days and fall off in the bath?</p>
<p>I've missed your nonsense.</p>
<p>(GARBAGE DISPOSAL GRINDING)</p>
<p>Now there's no evidence to tie us to the kidnapping.</p>
<p>And we've got a one-year lease on that torture room.</p>
<p>So maybe we can put a tanning bed in there.</p>
<p>(BOTH LAUGHING)</p>
<p>(PATTY AND SELMA EXCLAIM)</p>
<p>We know it was you, Selma Bouvier!</p>
<p>(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)</p>
<p>Would you kids like cookies? Let your Auntie Patty make some cookies.</p>
<p>We don't want your cookies.</p>
<p>What she means is, we'll eat your cookies later.</p>
<p>If you don't want us to tell our mom what you did, you're gonna have to pay.</p>
<p>Pay? Pay for what?</p>
<p>Ask her. She's the brains. I'm the thing that's not the brains.</p>
<p>(BOTH GRUNT ANGRILY)</p>
<p>And with the inking and application of this stamp, you are officially married. Next.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, honey.</p>
<p>I wanted so badly to give you a fancy wedding.</p>
<p>Homer, one thing I've learned is that you don't need a fancy wedding when you're marrying the man you love.</p>
<p><em>(BRIDAL CHORUS</em> PLAYING)</p>
<p>(CROWD CHEERING)</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>Just what I always wanted!</p>
<p>A rocket ship wedding cake! Just what I always wanted!</p>
<p>We emptied our 401(k)s for this?</p>
<p>Zoom. Zoom.</p>
<p>Oh! Blue roses!</p>
<p>Yes. It took a lot of frantic genetic engineering, but enjoy.</p>
<p>(HISSING)</p>
<p>No! You're a plant now!</p>
