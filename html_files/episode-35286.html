<p> How was the sleepover?</p>
<p> They each had a 5-Hour Energy drink and a jar of Nutella and then watched Russian dashcam videos all night.</p>
<p> Vodit' znachit ubivat'!</p>
<p> Listen, Marge.</p>
<p> Every year, Kirk and I rent a luxury villa in Costa Rica and invite a few select families to join us.</p>
<p> (chuckles)</p>
<p> Maybe you've heard about it?</p>
<p> MARGE: I've always dreamed of being invited on this trip, and now it's about to happen.</p>
<p> Play it cool, Marge, like only you can.</p>
<p> Let me see.</p>
<p> Um (smacking lips)</p>
<p> Costa Rica Nope, nope.</p>
<p> (popping lips)</p>
<p> Sorry, it's news to me.</p>
<p> We were wondering, would your family be interested in joining us?</p>
<p> When would you need an answer by?</p>
<p> Oh, the sooner the better.</p>
<p> (tires screeching)</p>
<p> MARGE: Costa Rica!</p>
<p> Costa Rica!</p>
<p> Time to rock and MARGE: Costa Rica!</p>
<p> Whee!</p>
<p> MARGE (chanting): Costa Rica!</p>
<p> Costa Rica!</p>
<p> Costa Rica!</p>
<p> - (tires screech)</p>
<p> - Costa Rica.</p>
<p> Family meeting!</p>
<p> Right now!</p>
<p> (woozy groaning)</p>
<p> Mwah!</p>
<p> The Van Houtens invited us on their super-exclusive multi-family vacation to Costa Rica!</p>
<p> We'll stay in a luxury villa right on the beach Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p> near pristine rain forests, home to five percent of the species on Earth Biodiversity!</p>
<p> in a land where it's normal for kids to carry machetes.</p>
<p> Legalize it!</p>
<p> And you can chew on the guidebook.</p>
<p> I've always dreamed of being the kind of family that other families would be willing to do things with.</p>
<p> BART AND LISA (chanting): Costa Rica!</p>
<p> - Costa Rica!</p>
<p> - Airport food court!</p>
<p> - Airport food court!</p>
<p> - Costa Rica!</p>
<p> Whoa.</p>
<p> Now, that's a tympanic membrane that just won't quit.</p>
<p> HOMER: Whoa.</p>
<p> This trip's gonna cost how much?</p>
<p> MARGE: I know it's expensive, but we spend our whole lives worrying about money.</p>
<p> That's because we don't have that much.</p>
<p> We have a mortgage, a reverse mortgage.</p>
<p> I think the house is owned by the car.</p>
<p> Life is about experiences.</p>
<p> Look at this photo the Hibberts posted from last year's trip.</p>
<p> Now look at my feed.</p>
<p> Yeah.</p>
<p> Oh, boy.</p>
<p> I want a photo of you and me by that waterfall.</p>
<p> The hope of going on this trip is the only reason I've allowed Bart to stay friends with Milhouse.</p>
<p> Now I understand everything.</p>
<p> MARGE: Homie, I know it's a stretch, but if Kirk and Luann can afford it Yeah.</p>
<p> He can't earn that much.</p>
<p> His job is moving the Topless Maids van so they don't get parking tickets.</p>
<p> Let's have one damn fling and hope everything will be okay.</p>
<p> You know what?</p>
<p> You are right.</p>
<p> I am sick of being the responsible one in this marriage.</p>
<p> Let's live life.</p>
<p> Remember, we can never be poor as long as we have each other.</p>
<p> (both sigh)</p>
<p> (groaning): Oh yes, we can.</p>
<p> You know, what if we stayed home and just did puzzles of Costa Rica?</p>
<p> I mean, this trip sounds really expensive.</p>
<p> - No, not really.</p>
<p> - What?</p>
<p> No!</p>
<p> You just let the grown-ups worry about grown-up things, okay?</p>
<p> (chuckles)</p>
<p> Your mom and dad have our financial future all under control.</p>
<p> (tires squeal)</p>
<p> Ooh!</p>
<p> Free ticket!</p>
<p> The rich get richer!</p>
<p> (groans)</p>
<p> Ah, the multi-family vacation.</p>
<p> Let's see who we've got.</p>
<p> The Van Houtens, of course.</p>
<p> The Hibberts.</p>
<p> Superintendent Chalmers and his daughter.</p>
<p> I can't believe my father is tearing us apart for a whole week.</p>
<p> Sweetie, it's a very long flight.</p>
<p> Why don't you save your phone battery.</p>
<p> All you care about is batteries!</p>
<p> You've never been in love.</p>
<p> Your mother and I had a very (sighs)</p>
<p> Never mind.</p>
<p> Yep, not one person here I'd mind spending an extended period of time with.</p>
<p> I didn't have time to wax, so I'll do it on the plane.</p>
<p> (Homer gasps)</p>
<p> What the hell is that doing here?</p>
<p> Well, Lou the cop and his sister were gonna go, but a billboard fell on him and her wind chime store b*rned down.</p>
<p> So I suggested Patty and her new girlfriend.</p>
<p> You deliberately hid this from me until it was too late to back out.</p>
<p> - Yes.</p>
<p> - Don't try to deny it.</p>
<p> (Patty and Evelyn moan)</p>
<p> Patty's new relationship really has to work out, because the dating apps won't take her anymore.</p>
<p> All I ask is that you're nice to them.</p>
<p> Evelyn, this is my husband Homer.</p>
<p> A very polite hello to you, madam.</p>
<p> Well, well, Homer Simpson.</p>
<p> I've heard so much about you.</p>
<p> Surely you have, but in my defense, urinating on a privately owned merry-go-round is not public urination.</p>
<p> Hmm.</p>
<p> (all gasp)</p>
<p> MARGE (gasps): Ooh.</p>
<p> Okay, who wants Miguelitos?</p>
<p> Now, I should warn the newbies These will seem very authentic to you.</p>
<p> Mmm.</p>
<p> This stuff is pura vida in a glass.</p>
<p> What's pura vida?</p>
<p> (chuckling)</p>
<p> Oh (continues chuckling)</p>
<p> Uh, it means &quot;pure life.</p>
<p> &quot; Kind of a state of mind down here.</p>
<p> Very chill.</p>
<p> Like what you think of as chill but, like, a million times chiller.</p>
<p> Homie, I think I'm having an experience.</p>
<p> Every time a fruit meets a booze, a magic vacation is born.</p>
<p> - (cash register dings)</p>
<p> - (Lisa groans)</p>
<p> Mmm.</p>
<p> (groaning): Oh Well, you can try.</p>
<p> (laughter)</p>
<p> Oh, boy, I didn't know that.</p>
<p> - Hmm?</p>
<p> - Hmm?</p>
<p> (laughter)</p>
<p> So true.</p>
<p> - EVELYN: Hmm - HOMER: Hmm.</p>
<p> Rodrigo, Rodrigo, mi hermano, put the bill on this.</p>
<p> (chuckles)</p>
<p> Nothing is less pura vida than check-splitting.</p>
<p> On this trip I pay for everything up front Food, the villa rental, cloud forest m*rder mystery And I keep track of 'em right here.</p>
<p> Then we settle up at the end.</p>
<p> ANNOUNCER: Smokey Blandings is putting on a cornhole clinic tonight.</p>
<p> ANNOUNCER 2: And this is where fatigue really sets in, Jim.</p>
<p> When you're tossing that fourth beanbag, your muscles are screaming, son.</p>
<p> - Booyah!</p>
<p> - Good heavenly days!</p>
<p> Hmm?</p>
<p> You also follow the pro cornhole tour?</p>
<p> Sure do.</p>
<p> I used to play on my daddy's farm.</p>
<p> We'd toss bags all day, even when it was hotter than a two-dollar p*stol.</p>
<p> Ooh, ooh.</p>
<p> That is hot.</p>
<p> Do you always speak in such colorful Southern-isms?</p>
<p> (laughs)</p>
<p> Does a mama possum skip church on Sundays?</p>
<p> Hmm.</p>
<p> I bet she does.</p>
<p> (laughs)</p>
<p> Homer, put your phone away.</p>
<p> Evelyn, please.</p>
<p> (both chuckle)</p>
<p> Evelyn, you don't want to go shopping with us?</p>
<p> It's a vacation, sugar bear.</p>
<p> We should be lying on the beach like a lost flip-flop.</p>
<p> (chuckles)</p>
<p> But, darling, there's nothing to do at the beach except drink.</p>
<p> You know what?</p>
<p> Why don't you two take in the sights while I chaperone your Southern seÃ±orita to the beach?</p>
<p> Well, my, my, what an elegant solution.</p>
<p> Well, I guess this way everyone's happy.</p>
<p> (Marge and Patty grumble)</p>
<p> (Evelyn chuckles)</p>
<p> Tonight's dinner is amazing, folks: line-caught mahi mahi.</p>
<p> The local fishermen pass the lines down from father to son, so, boy, you can taste the heritage.</p>
<p> (monkeys screeching)</p>
<p> KIRK: Dios mÃ­o!</p>
<p> Eh, what?</p>
<p> Oh.</p>
<p> Hey, guys.</p>
<p> We met these awesome monkeys on the beach, and we said they could crash here in exchange for them being hilarious.</p>
<p> (laughs)</p>
<p> Sweetie, you did not tell me your brother-in-law was such a fun guy.</p>
<p> You two should be so happy.</p>
<p> Your husband and your girlfriend are amigos!</p>
<p> (Marge and Patty grumble)</p>
<p> (gasps)</p>
<p> Who's that with you, Jimbo?</p>
<p> Is that Stacy?</p>
<p> Oh, my God.</p>
<p> Jimbo is cheating on me!</p>
<p> Wha?</p>
<p> Okay, makeup kit, selfie stick.</p>
<p> (gasps)</p>
<p> Oh, God, where's the selfie stick charger?</p>
<p> Honey, relax.</p>
<p> The waterfall picture's going to be fine.</p>
<p> Fine?</p>
<p> If this photo is just &quot;fine,&quot; we're getting a divorce.</p>
<p> - (whimpers)</p>
<p> - Okay, okay, that crossed the line, but this is a once-in-a-lifetime trip and our only sh*t at a perfect moment.</p>
<p> I get it you're mad about my awesome monkey party.</p>
<p> But you wanted me to be nice to Patty's girlfriend, and guess what.</p>
<p> She's cool.</p>
<p> Just what you need, another drinking buddy.</p>
<p> Just promise me you'll behave for the rest of the trip.</p>
<p> Okay, okay.</p>
<p> I will stay far away from Patty's fun Southern girlfriend.</p>
<p> Or as she would say, &quot;further away than a fat-cheeked boy from a porch full of grannies. &quot; (giggles)</p>
<p> Run, fat boy, run!</p>
<p> (grunting)</p>
<p> (anxious panting)</p>
<p> Why are you freaking out?</p>
<p> Shouldn't you be in the jungle kissing a boa constrictor or something?</p>
<p> This trip is so expensive, and Mom and Dad don't care, so I'm practicing sleeping in a car for when we lose the house and have to sleep in our car!</p>
<p> Well, Milhouse's dad writes down how much money everyone owes in that book, so all we have to do is snag it, then show Mom and Dad the numbers.</p>
<p> Yes!</p>
<p> That'll snap 'em out of their financial insanity.</p>
<p> You up for a little breaking and entering?</p>
<p> Break into a grown-up's bedroom?</p>
<p> Whoa, big move.</p>
<p> Okay, we'll do it when everyone's on the hike.</p>
<p> But how do we get rid of Milhouse?</p>
<p> Not a problem.</p>
<p> Milhouse already ditched me for Dr.</p>
<p> Hibbert's kid.</p>
<p> His &quot;vacation friend.</p>
<p> &quot; Hey, JJ, do you still like Legos?</p>
<p> - Uh not really.</p>
<p> - Me neither.</p>
<p> Lego sucks!</p>
<p> (grunts)</p>
<p> Hey, JJ, why don't we put on a play for the grown-ups tonight?</p>
<p> Ooh, sweetie, look, a &quot;Flowers of Costa Rica&quot; scavenger hunt.</p>
<p> I wonder how many we can find together?</p>
<p> Just braid, Daddy!</p>
<p> I need to look super hot to win back Jimbo's heart.</p>
<p> (sighs)</p>
<p> Darling, you're experiencing so many emotions for the first time.</p>
<p> And that's very healthy, but He strayed because of you!</p>
<p> Hey, JJ, one time my friend got a temporary tattoo but told his dad it was real.</p>
<p> Okay, let's steal that ledger.</p>
<p> What's that thing?</p>
<p> Grappling hook made of Patty's underwire bra and Dad's bathing suit drawstring.</p>
<p> Will it reach?</p>
<p> (grunts)</p>
<p> (clicks)</p>
<p> This is so weird, being in another grown-up's bedroom.</p>
<p> Boy, you're telling me.</p>
<p> He doesn't even work out.</p>
<p> Uh, I don't want to learn anything else about this family.</p>
<p> It's too late.</p>
<p> (both shuddering)</p>
<p> All right, bottled water break.</p>
<p> I can drink from the stream.</p>
<p> After all these years, my gut biome is simpatico with the local bacteria.</p>
<p> Ugh!</p>
<p> Oh, God, there's something moving inside me!</p>
<p> Oh, look out!</p>
<p> Oh, look out!</p>
<p> Look out, I said look out!</p>
<p> Look out!</p>
<p> Oh, God, no simpatico!</p>
<p> No simpatico!</p>
<p> Hey, Homer.</p>
<p> You want a hit off this?</p>
<p> Oh, Evelyn.</p>
<p> You and I both love secret day drinking, but I promised Marge I'd have a bad time the rest of this vacation.</p>
<p> I hear exactly what you're saying.</p>
<p> Mm-hmm?</p>
<p> Mmm.</p>
<p> - (gasps)</p>
<p> - Did you find the ledger?</p>
<p> No, but take a look at this.</p>
<p> These are stone spheres made by the extinct Diquis people of Costa Rica.</p>
<p> No one knows what they were for, but they're priceless artifacts.</p>
<p> So what is Milhouse's loser dad doing with them?</p>
<p> - (lock clicks)</p>
<p> - (both gasp)</p>
<p> (Kirk groans)</p>
<p> Oh, I'm sorry, Kirk's tum-tum.</p>
<p> (groans)</p>
<p> Daddy drank some ick-ick.</p>
<p> (Kirk groans)</p>
<p> Oh, the rumblies are coming.</p>
<p> The rumblies are coming!</p>
<p> - They're here!</p>
<p> - (Bart grunts)</p>
<p> (Kirk groans)</p>
<p> If we get this photo right, this multi-family vacation will be worth every penny.</p>
<p> (Homer giggles)</p>
<p> You're so cute when you're super controlling.</p>
<p> - (Marge sniffs)</p>
<p> - (phone camera clicks)</p>
<p> You've been drinking.</p>
<p> (slurring): Well, maybe Evelyn added a little Southern charm to my water.</p>
<p> That woman!</p>
<p> She brings out the worst in you!</p>
<p> Look!</p>

<p> MARGE: Oh, my God.</p>
<p> It's perfect.</p>
<p> You look good, and I look better.</p>
<p> Post it.</p>
<p> Post it.</p>
<p> EVELYN: Homer!</p>
<p> Buddy, hi.</p>
<p> Watch me do a Savannah Polecat Flip.</p>
<p> (whoops, grunts)</p>
<p> No!</p>
<p> Come back, camera fish!</p>
<p> (grunting)</p>
<p> Oh!</p>
<p> (grunts)</p>
<p> (Homer groaning frantically)</p>
<p> (Patty growls)</p>
<p> All I wanted was for my friends to be jealous of me.</p>
<p> I hope you're happy now that that bald gorilla has dragged my girlfriend down to his pathetic level.</p>
<p> (snoring)</p>
<p> Patricia Maleficent Bouvier, I've put up with you criticizing my husband for years, and I've had it.</p>
<p> Evelyn got Homer drunk.</p>
<p> Evelyn ruined my dream photo.</p>
<p> She's the bad influence.</p>
<p> That's ridiculous.</p>
<p> She may be Southern, she may be a woman, but you're dating a Homer.</p>
<p> (Evelyn and Homer snoring)</p>
<p> Oh, no.</p>
<p> Mom, look what I found in the Van Houtens' room!</p>
<p> They are smuggling these artifacts home to sell!</p>
<p> (all gasping)</p>
<p> That's how they can afford this vacation.</p>
<p> But we can't.</p>
<p> And we're gonna have to live in our car, and the seats in our car are sticky, even though they're cloth!</p>
<p> (sobbing): You're you're so gross.</p>
<p> It's so gross.</p>
<p> Salt and pepper.</p>
<p> These souvenirs were supposed to be our end-of-multi-family-vacation gift to you all.</p>
<p> Way to spoil the surprise.</p>
<p> Not very pura vida.</p>
<p> Not very pura vida at all.</p>
<p> (Lisa and Marge grunt)</p>
<p> Stacy and I are finished.</p>
<p> Shauna Chalmers, will you marry me?</p>
<p> Oh, my God!</p>
<p> Jimbo proposed!</p>
<p> We are getting freaking married!</p>
<p> (chattering)</p>
<p> Oh, you guys are slinking off early.</p>
<p> Don't you want to come ziplining and ruin the trip some more?</p>
<p> Well, I would like to agree with my wife that it's better we leave.</p>
<p> I'll give you the final bill now so we can settle up.</p>
<p> No discount for leaving early either.</p>
<p> (laughs)</p>
<p> I may be mucho pura vida, but, uh, I'm not a sucker.</p>
<p> Lisa was right.</p>
<p> We really couldn't afford this trip.</p>
<p> (breathing loudly)</p>
<p> (whoops)</p>
<p> Ooh, that's a big number.</p>
<p> (guttural panting)</p>
<p> (groans)</p>
<p> How's Patty?</p>
<p> I haven't seen her.</p>
<p> I don't know what happened.</p>
<p> She broke up with me.</p>
<p> Yeesh.</p>
<p> I know you feel bad, Mom, but the lady is a Homer.</p>
<p> BOTH: Mmm.</p>
<p> Oh, all that money, and we didn't even get the picture.</p>
<p> (gasps)</p>
<p> Look at this.</p>
<p> Mr. Van Houten even charged us for those salt and pepper shakers.</p>
<p> He said those were a gift.</p>
<p> And he didn't even give them to us.</p>
<p> Then we're not leaving without them.</p>
<p> - (Homer grunts)</p>
<p> - (Bart yells)</p>
<p> (thud)</p>
<p> (all gasping)</p>
<p> Oh, so that explains it.</p>
<p> HOMER: Gotcha.</p>
<p> Can't you let us even zipline in peace?</p>
<p> Look what we found hidden in your bedroom.</p>
<p> This is a portrait of explorer Kirkedemious Van Houten, who settled this area for a Dutch cracker-trading company, and he built this house, which your family still owns.</p>
<p> You're charging us thousands of dollars in rent for a house you get for free.</p>
<p> The Van Houtens are cheating all of us, so we pay for their vacation.</p>
<p> - I'm stunned.</p>
<p> - I'm shocked.</p>
<p> I'm Shauna.</p>
<p> I'm just as surprised as any of you.</p>
<p> Oh, what?!</p>
<p> Come on!</p>
<p> This scam was her idea.</p>
<p> And this year she even charged you more so we could pay for our &quot;intimacy coach.</p>
<p> &quot; I mean, how many things can you do with a feather?</p>
<p> Ooh.</p>
<p> Oh, easy, guys, easy.</p>
<p> Everyone try to remain pura vida.</p>
<p> Huh?</p>
<p> I'm gonna pura vida my foot in your ass if you don't give me back my money.</p>
<p> He's zipping away!</p>
<p> Stop him before he endorses those checks!</p>
<p> So, you and Evelyn broke up?</p>
<p> I thought you really liked her.</p>
<p> I did, but now all I see is Homer, thanks to you.</p>
<p> Patty!</p>
<p> Come back!</p>
<p> I can't!</p>
<p> Because I'm on a zipline Ooh.</p>
<p> (grunts)</p>
<p> Patty, I'm sorry I upset you, but Evelyn is your Homer, and no one else will ever understand why you love her, except for you.</p>
<p> But there's one huge difference between them.</p>
<p> (grunts)</p>
<p> (Marge grunting)</p>
<p> I'm listening.</p>
<p> Evelyn loves you, and Homer hates you more than anything in the world.</p>
<p> Even more than he hates Selma?</p>
<p> He feels sorry for Selma, because she has to live with you.</p>
<p> Hold on, Evelyn!</p>
<p> I'm coming!</p>
<p> Go ahead, take your money.</p>
<p> Take away a man's only source of income.</p>
<p> No, it's real classy.</p>
<p> We just got a free vacation.</p>
<p> LISA, MARGE AND BART: Hooray!</p>
<p> Now let's charter a helicopter back to the waterfall to get your mom's precious picture.</p>
<p> (groans)</p>
<p> No, no, no.</p>
<p> It's okay.</p>
<p> Vacations aren't about the perfect photo.</p>
<p> It's about being in the moment and living your vida.</p>
<p> Mwah!</p>
<p> (both exclaiming happily)</p>
<p> They're as cute as two bugs in a rug.</p>
<p> Aw.</p>
<p> (laughs)</p>
<p> Honey, I just want you to know that Jimbo Jones is a fine young man, and I'm very happy for you two to be married.</p>
<p> - Truly.</p>
<p> - Yeah Jimbo's parents freaked out and canceled the wedding.</p>
<p> Whatever.</p>
<p> I'm glad somebody's setting limits.</p>
<p> You know, pumpkin, I'm doing my best.</p>
<p> Do you understand that?</p>
<p> That as a single father, it's not always so easy to balance guidance with respect for your Yeah CHALMERS: Yeah, now we're connecting, huh?</p>
<p> Why can't we just leave?</p>
<p> 'Cause we have to clean up before Uncle Pete gets here, or we'll lose our week next year.</p>
<p> - (monkeys hooting)</p>
<p> - (screams)</p>
<p> Hey, hey, this stuff is expensive!</p>
<p> Â¿Comprende?</p>
<p> (grunts)</p>
<p> - Uh-oh.</p>
<p> Uh-oh.</p>
<p> - (hooting)</p>
<p> No, amigos, no, no.</p>
<p> No, pura vida!</p>
<p> Pura vida!</p>
<p> Oh, no!</p>
<p> No bueno!</p>
