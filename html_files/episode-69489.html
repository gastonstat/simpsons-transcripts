<p>the world's foremost<br />
Bleeding Gums Murphy expert.    </p>
<p>I'm still working on that name.    </p>
<p>But I can tell you    </p>
<p>he would not want his incredible music    </p>
<p>used for this carnival of greed<br />
known as the lottery.    </p>
<p>- Little girl, you claim to know everything about Mr. Murphy.<br />
- I do.    </p>
<p>- Do you even know his first name?<br />
- Oscar.    </p>
<p>- Do you know his favorite key?<br />
- B-flat.    </p>

Favorite brand of reed?    </p>

<p>Favorite type of jazz?    </p>

<p>Do you know the name<br />
of his first recording?    </p>
<p>Well, his first album was<br />
<em>Broken Elevator Blues.</em>    </p>
<p>- Yes...<br />
- But his first recording    </p>
<p>was at Minton's Playhouse    </p>
<p>playing alongside Thelonious Monk    </p>
<p>when Bleeding Gums was   .    </p>
<p>Hmm, right again.    </p>

<p>Uh, no. I learned it on the website,    </p>
<p>Bleeding Gummy Bears.    </p>
<p>(CHUCKLES): Yes!<br />
Finally nailed the title.    </p>
<p>But the lottery must<br />
be giving you money.    </p>
<p>Enough for the implant. Right?    </p>
<p>Nope. I'm afraid<br />
I haven't gotten any money.    </p>
<p>I'm sorry, what?<br />
I was destined to find you.    </p>
<p>My new mission in life<br />
is to make you happy.    </p>
<p>You're my new cause.    </p>
<p>Hold up. I'm not anybody's cause.    </p>
<p>I enjoy who I am. I love my community.    </p>
<p>And, you know, sometimes I like<br />
turning off annoying sounds    </p>
<p>by just closing my eyes.    </p>
<p>Oh, yes. I hate annoying noises.    </p>
<p>Now just listen.<br />
Here's what we're gonna do.    </p>
<p>We're gonna bring those<br />
publishers to their knees.    </p>
<p>You and I are g...    </p>
<p>...gonna lawyer up, and I...    </p>
<p>Then, eventually,<br />
the Supreme Court will hear...    </p>
<p>...going to restore your dad's legacy.    </p>
<p>Now? I have to eat.<br />
I have a bl*od sugar thing.    </p>

<p>Your dad used to bring you here<br />

<p>Now, that was a smash hit.    </p>
<p>Oh, it's so good to see you again.    </p>
<p>No one knew your dad better than me.    </p>
<p>I knew him better than his mama,    </p>
