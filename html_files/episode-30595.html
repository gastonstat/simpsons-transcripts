<p><strong>Homer</strong>: <em>In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice.</p>
<p>He said, &quot;The laziest way to tell a story is through voice-over narration.&quot;</p>
<p>With that in mind, I tell the tale of the tragic collision between the last tycoon of the Jazz Age and the king of a hip-hop empire.</p>
<p>It began with an old man feeling like his best years had passed him by.</em></p>
<p>(sighs)</p>
<p>You seem glum, sir.</p>
<p>How about a bl*od transfusion?</p>
<p>We have some new small batch, single donor plasmas.</p>
<p>Mmm. Better make it a double.</p>
<p>My life used to be so lively, so full of excitement.</p>
<p><strong>Women</strong>: ♪ Monty! ♪</p>
<p><em>Such shindigs I threw at my summer estate.</p>
<p>In an age of shameful excess, my parties were legendary for their magnificent excess.</p>
<p>Fortunes were won and lost at my tables.</p>
<p>Affairs were launched on my dance floor and consummated on my floor-floor.</p>
<p>Sultans mingled with Sultans of Swat.</em></p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: ♪ Monty! ♪</p>
<p>(cheering)</p>
<p><em>And presiding over it all was me, Monogram Monty Burns.</em></p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>Well... what if we throw a classic shindig at your old summer place?</p>
<p>Why, yes.</p>
<p>A beachside bacchanal just like the Roaring Twenties.</p>
<p>That'll put the Cole back in my Porter.</p>
<p>What fun.</p>
<p>Now, I have 45 close friends who are all pretty amazing party planners.</p>
<p>I'm not squandering money on some chap to bring in a photo booth.</p>
<p>I'll take care of every detail myself.</p>
<p>Everything, sir?</p>
<p>Oh, fine. You can fetch the ice.</p>
<p>Okay. How many bags?</p>
<p>Oh, no. None of those pricey store-bought cubes.</p>
<p>Now, you head up to Northern Canada and get me a quarter ton of lake ice.</p>
<p>Hand-sawn and tong-carried.</p>
<p>Risk my life in the arctic wilderness just to bring you some ice.</p>
<p>It would be an honor.</p>
<p>Would you like it packed in cedar sawdust or Spanish oak?</p>
<p>Oh, who cares? Ice is ice.</p>
<p>It says Mega Stuf on the package, but these are Double Stuf at best.</p>
<p>(licking) What?</p>
<p>Send me a free tub of Stuf and I'll shut down my Web site.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Simpson, you seem fairly popular, at least based on the cheers you got at employee karaoke night.</p>
<p>It's not me, it's &quot;Mustang Sally.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Burns is throwing a little party, and most of his invitees are either dead or fictional.</p>
<p>Uh, to, uh, well, fill out the crowd, uh, perhaps you could, uh, distribute these invitations to your more, uh, presentable friends.</p>
<p>I know just who to invite.</p>
<p>You're not invited.</p>
<p>To what?</p>
<p>None of your business!</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: <em>&quot;Your esteemed presence is requested</em></p>
<p>&quot;for an evening of madcap magic and mischief at Monty Burns' Middle Hampton estate.&quot;</p>
<p>The card stock is so thick.</p>
<p>Bart, get in here and feel this stock.</p>
<p>Oh, man, that's heavy.</p>
<p>The Springfield Hamptons?</p>
<p>That's on Lengthy Island, where rich people hang out on summer weekends.</p>
<p>I know all about it from cartoons in literary magazines.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: I'm not reading all that.</p>
<p>Well, now to select the perfect guest list of our city's sharpest wits and glittering socialites.</p>
<p>(car alarms blaring, Homer whistling)</p>
<p>Boy oh boy, a '20s shindig at Old Man Burnsie's.</p>
<p>Probably gonna be bathtubs full of shrimp and Jacuzzis full of brisket.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll meet a rich bachelor who will sweep me off my feet.</p>
<p>How do I smell?</p>
<p>(sniffs)</p>
<p>Like a wood fire put out by dumping coffee on it.</p>
<p>Oh! Perfect.</p>
<p>Hey, everyone, hey!</p>
<p>I'm off-duty, so please don't feel weird doing drugs in front of me.</p>
<p>Uh, or with me. (chuckles)</p>
<p>I became a cop too young.</p>
<p>I never lived.</p>
<p>I didn't live.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: <em>And so I entered a world of wealth.</p>
<p>Where mansions are called &quot;cottages.&quot;</p>
<p>And getting drunk on a boat is called &quot;sailing.&quot;</em></p>
<p>(all gasping)</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Get ready for fancy.</p>
<p>(indistinct chatter)</p>
<p>I don't see any magic.</p>
<p>And not a hint of mischief.</p>
<p>Off-brand Ritz cracker?</p>
<p>Salt pile?</p>
<p>Nothing in a blanket?</p>
<p>Dad, did Mr. Burns cheap out?</p>
<p>That's impossible.</p>
<p>He's the richest man in town.</p>
<p>If I had known this was a cash bar, I would've gotten wasted beforehand!</p>
<p>At my sister's house!</p>
<p>(fanfare plays)</p>
<p>Welcome, honored guests.</p>
<p>Leave your inhibitions at the door.</p>
<p>And write your name on your drink cup, you will not receive a second.</p>
<p>(muttering)</p>
<p>Now, dance the night away on my vintage 1920s parquet floor.</p>
<p>The cleaning of which is not cheap, so be sure to don your protective booties.</p>
<p>(Moe grunting)</p>
<p><strong>Skinner</strong>: Look, Mr. Burns, nobody loves a party with rules more than I do.</p>
<p>Even I'm baffled by the toilet payment system.</p>
<p>Oh, it's simple, bring the chit from the applicable restroom to the purser...</p>
<p>You might've been fun a hundred years ago, Burnsie, but now you're a cheap, old lamewad.</p>
<p>And trust me, I know cheap.</p>
<p>That's right, I bought a suit, Xeroxed it, returned it, and wore the copy.</p>
<p>(grunts)</p>
<p>(guests groaning)</p>
<p>Waste of my time.</p>
<p>Why is everyone leaving?</p>
<p>Of course, no ice.</p>
<p>Mm, that lazy Smithers is probably sipping hot buttered rum in a ski chalet overlooking Lake Louise.</p>
<p>(grunting frantically)</p>
<p>(growls)</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>(growls)</p>
<p>(brays)</p>
<p>(Smithers screams)</p>
<p>(crying)</p>
<p>Hey, Mr. Burns, fun party.</p>
<p>No one felt any pressure to talk or laugh or stay past 7:30.</p>
<p>Super chill.</p>
<p>Oh, hush. I'm a worn-out old miser who's forgotten the meaning of fun.</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>Great Gatsby!</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>(music and indistinct chatter in distance)</p>
<p>Someone else is having a party across the bay.</p>
<p>(chuckles) Once I would've thought nothing of rowing across the water and crashing that party.</p>
<p>All doors would open for Monogram Monty.</p>
<p>That was a long time ago.</p>
<p>Aw, I'll row you over.</p>
<p>How hard could it be?</p>
<p>(Homer gasping for air)</p>
<p>Oh, so hard.</p>
<p>Would it help if I whipped you?</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Yeah, a little.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>Yeah. (grunting)</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>Whoa, it's a white party.</p>

<p>And nobody crashes my party.</p>
<p>Not even you nobodies.</p>
<p>(g*n cock, Homer and Burns gasp)</p>
<p>Let's go, Mr. Burns.</p>
<p>What did you say?</p>
<p>Mr. Burns and I were just leaving.</p>
<p>Are you Montgomery Burns, the despised billionaire?</p>
<p>Well, that's what my cuff links say.</p>
<p>There's something I've wanted to tell you for a long time, you ruthless monster.</p>
<p>(whimpers)</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>I can't believe I'm meeting the Monty Burns.</p>
<p>How do you know me?</p>
<p>You're the dude who wrote <em>The Rungs of Ruthlessness.</em></p>
<p>(chuckles) Yes, back then they'd give a book contract to any CEO with a power tie and a bonsai tree.</p>
<p>When I was a boy, I found a copy left on the seat of a bus I stole.</p>
<p>And after I read it, I knew I'd jacked my last courtesy shuttle.</p>
<p>Your book became my bible.</p>
<p>&quot;Every empire needs an emblem.&quot;</p>
<p>See? There you told me to find a symbol to represent my brand.</p>
<p>And there he is, the living logo of Golden Goose Records, Goosius.</p>
<p>(honks)</p>
<p>You make me believe I can fly.</p>
<p>Goosius is on everything from my cognac-flavored vodka to the brake pads I coproduced with Lil Wayne.</p>
<p>Aw, he eats the same way I do, without swallowing.</p>
<p>You've flown south for the winter with my heart.</p>
<p>(honks)</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>I hope this bite never heals.</p>
<p>When I wrote an advice book, I never dreamed it would help anyone.</p>
<p>Everything I am I owe to you.</p>

<p>Well, then good news, Monty.</p>
<p>This is your party.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: <em>And so was forged the most unlikely of friendships.</p>
<p>A man who discovered Rick Ross and a man who dated Betsy Ross.</p>
<p>The next day, my family explored Middle Hampton.</p>
<p>A wonderland of boutiques paid for by rich husbands wanting to keep their wives busy.</p>

<p><strong>Women</strong>: ♪ Hampton, ah, Hampton. ♪</p>
<p>What kind of crazy flavors are these?</p>
<p>Quince jelly and pepper?</p>
<p>Market greens?</p>
<p>Bone broth brittle?</p>
<p>I don't know what this place hates more, kids or ice cream.</p>
<p>Really, man, a 3 Series?</p>
<p>I mean, what is he?</p>
<p>A sophomore at Exeter?</p>
<p>Yeah, one cup of salted caramel.</p>
<p>Woo-woo-woo, scoop with the stripe, stupid.</p>
<p>(chuckling): I mean...</p>
<p>That kid just cut in line.</p>
<p>Are you gonna let him do that?</p>
<p>That's Blake Black.</p>
<p>His dad runs BlackLake Investments.</p>
<p>So?</p>
<p>Richest dad rules?</p>
<p>Everyone knows that.</p>
<p>Well, I don't.</p>
<p>Don't misunderstand me, Mats Wilander may have been a decent player, but until his inglés gets just a little bit better, he can coach somebody else.</p>
<p>Pardon me a second.</p>
<p>What is it, head points, what?</p>
<p>Just because your father has money doesn't mean you can cut.</p>
<p>Hmm, it kind of looks like it does.</p>
<p>All right, I'll tell you what: because I am a nice guy, I am going to pay for everyone's cones.</p>
<p>Is that okay? Does that make it okay?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>I would never accept ice cream from someone whose manners are in the bottom one percent!</p>
<p>(gasping)</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>So, hey, hi.</p>
<p>Are you going to the Allens' hot-dog-and-horseshoes thing later?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The Forstmans' firefly thing?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The Olins' jellyfish fry thing?</p>
<p>I'm not going to any things at all!</p>
<p>But I want to, um, hang out.</p>
<p>What? Why?</p>
<p>I've never met anyone like you before.</p>
<p>Anyone with, you know, I don't know, um, morals.</p>
<p>Oh. (giggles)</p>
<p>Well, I guess it is a little judgy of me to be completely disgusted by you.</p>
<p>Great, I'll set something up. Erin, are you on?</p>
<p>Okay, I need to bail on the Kravises' freeze tag thing.</p>
<p>No, I know, I have to.</p>
<p>Send the big basket.</p>
<p>What's wrong, honey?</p>
<p>Lisa's got a rich boyfriend, Dad's hanging out with a hip-hop super producer, and I'm stuck window-shopping with you two fun-sucking stink buckets.</p>
<p>It's not fair!</p>
<p>Life's not fair, kid.</p>
<p>Do I know you?</p>
<p>If life was fair, you would know me.</p>
<p>But know this: Jay G ain't all that.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Buy a candle and I'll tell you.</p>
<p>What's your cheapest one?</p>
<p>$55.</p>
<p>No way. I could start a fire in the woods for nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: <em>So Bart met someone who I think comes back later.</p>
<p>I forget why.</em></p>
<p>Hmm. Who would have thought two billionaire Republicans from such different backgrounds could end up as chums?</p>
<p>Is not green a more powerful color than black or white?</p>
<p>The Lord picks a select few to accumulate more money than anyone else.</p>
<p>You and I bear that sacred avarice.</p>
<p>Each of my enterprises has its own G6.</p>
<p>What's that one?</p>
<p>That's for my... (chuckles) personal horticulturalist.</p>
<p>(chuckling): You know what I'm sayin'?</p>
<p>I don't.</p>
<p>You seem to get so much joy out of your money. I envy you.</p>
<p>You've given me so much, Monty.</p>
<p>Let me give you something back: the freedom to live large.</p>
<p>A charge plate?</p>
<p>I've never had one of those newfangled swipe-a-ma-jigs.</p>
<p>It's an Obsidian Card, the most exclusive.</p>
<p>No spending limit, no store has ever heard of it.</p>
<p>But they have to accept it.</p>
<p>Take it if you want to roll like G.</p>
<p>Don't forget to sign it.</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>No, no, not a felt-tip. Oh! It'll smudge.</p>
<p>Okay, quick, blow on it to dry the ink.</p>
<p>(both blowing)</p>
<p>Blake, I have to say, this whale watch was a very thoughtful idea.</p>
<p>(gasps) Oh, it's a whole family.</p>
<p>But they're so far away.</p>
<p>Far? Babe, when you whale watch with me, you sit pod-side.</p>
<p>Fellas! What can we do here?</p>
<p>This way, the whales know we are VIPs.</p>
<p>Um, where's the baby?</p>
<p>There's supposed to be a baby.</p>
<p>I paid for a calf.</p>
<p>Does that mean anything?</p>
<p>Whale-copters? VIP pod-view?</p>
<p>This is awful!</p>
<p>Well, if we went on some lame econo-watch, we might not see blowhole one.</p>
<p>I mean, what are you saying?</p>
<p>Are you hearing yourself?</p>
<p>Blake, I really believed you could change.</p>
<p>And you did, you became even more horrible.</p>
<p>(singing)</p>
<p>(grunts)</p>
<p>These aren't VIP emotions.</p>
<p>This is worse than the time I had to eat grocery store sushi.</p>
<p>The shiso leaf was plastic!</p>
<p>(crying): It was plastic!</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>: <em>You got to buy it, M.B., it's fate.</em></p>
<p>Oh, I don't know.</p>
<p>$100,000 feels like a lot of money.</p>
<p>You've got to splash the cash, fling the bling, spill them bills.</p>
<p>It don't matter, just splatter the batter.</p>
<p>Splash the cash.</p>

<p>If these rhymes are to be believed, Jay lured me into debt and now he owns everything.</p>
<p>Even my beloved nuclear plant.</p>
<p>Our magical friendship was a sham!</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: <em>The loneliest moment in someone's life is when they're watching their whole world fall apart.</p>

<p>Now he's really sobbing heavy.</p>

<p>All of his buttons fell off of his shirt.</p>
<p>Oh, now he's kicking his porch.</p>
<p>Oh, he hurt his foot and he's hopping around.</p>
<p>Oh, he tripped over a dog.</em></p>

<p><em>That's way worse.</p>
<p>Montgomery Burns had hit rock-bottom.</p>

<p>And by an excess of cataracts.</p>
<p>Wait. What happened to my posse?</p>
<p>Don't you worry. A posse's loyalty is forever.</p>
<p>Hey, Burnsie, I didn't get any brand-new sneakers today.</p>
<p>I can't be wearing two-day-old sneakers.</p>
<p>Hey, if there's no more money, we'll take our personalized bowling balls, fold-up bicycles, and go.</p>
<p>(bicycles squeaking)</p>
<p>(sighs)</p>
<p>I'm here for my hounds.</p>
<p>(growling)</p>
<p>Huh! Preposterous. I raised those hounds from pups.</p>
<p>I'm the only master they've ever known.</p>
<p>One word from me and they'll rip you apart.</p>

<p>If you don't, Mr. Jay G will release the hounds.</p>
<p>Jay, I don't understand. I thought we were friends.</p>
<p>We were going to open up a money-losing winery together.</p>
<p>We can still hang out. Even though our owners are fighting.</p>
<p>(honks)</p>
<p>Not being bitten... (cries) hurts the most.</p>

<p>Good Simpson. Faithful Simpson.</p>
<p>You would never go back to the nuclear plant that was so cruelly taken from me.</p>
<p>What does your heart say?</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: <em>I looked deep into my heart, and it said...</em></p>
<p>Uh... let me ask my wife.</p>
<p>I don't care if Mr. Burns doesn't own the nuclear plant anymore. You still have to work there.</p>
<p>You have a wife, a family, and a store to support.</p>
<p>You're right, you're right.</p>
<p>Wait. A store?</p>
<p>I have a store.</p>
<p>How did that happen?</p>
<p>Well, you spend enough time in the Hamptons and you have any flair at all, you just wind up with a store.</p>

<p>Can't we live off the money from your store?</p>
<p>Oh, God, no!</p>
<p>Right now I'm still building inventory.</p>
<p>Luckily, the pincushion store across the street went out of business.</p>
<p>I just swooped right in and bought up everything.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>

<p>I've got a granny in Atlanta who custom bakes them just for me.</p>
<p>Peach, berry, cherry, rhubarb, pineapple.</p>
<p>You can't cobbler pineapple.</p>
<p>Yet here it is.</p>
<p>(crying)</p>
<p>Homie, what's wrong?</p>
<p>(crying): I've never seen such beautiful cobbler.</p>
<p><em>But there was a hole in me that even a thousand pans of hot fruit couldn't fill.</p>
<p>I had betrayed Mr. Burns and felt sick about it.</p>

<p>Mr. Burns, what are you doing in this death hole?</p>
<p>All I have left is my family mausoleum.</p>
<p>Would you like a sip of grief soup?</p>
<p>I stewed it from flowers left on graves.</p>
<p>I confess, I went back to work at the plant.</p>
<p>Jay G seduced me with cobbler.</p>
<p>But after the eighth pan, it tasted like ashes.</p>
<p>Ice cream got me through three more pans, but after that, ashes.</p>
<p>Well, now you have to decide, once and for all, where your allegiance lies.</p>
<p>I'm not going back to that job.</p>
<p>I'm gonna stay here with you and we're going to get even with Jay G.</p>
<p>And as God is my witness, I will not tell my wife what I'm up to.</p>
<p>Oh, that's good.</p>
<p>Come on, Simpson.</p>
<p>Give me more ideas to get back at Jay G.</p>
<p>Fill his office with balloons?</p>

<p>Fill his office with scorpions?</p>
<p>Eh, I'm having a fight with my scorpion guy.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh. Banana in his tailpipe.</p>

<p>You're not dead. Are you?</p>
<p>I followed you. I got suspicious when you came home last night covered in grave dirt.</p>
<p>Be gone, urchin. We have work to do.</p>
<p>Wait, wait! He can help.</p>
<p>No one's better at nasty schemes than this kid.</p>
<p>I mean, he's messed up.</p>
<p>Look at him. You got to figure his family life's a disaster.</p>
<p>Why should I help Burns now that he's broke?</p>
<p>I've got more money than he does.</p>
<p>Would the cape and gloves of the infamous Gaslight Strangler change your mind?</p>
<p>If you want to take down a rapper, you got to destroy the thing that's most important to him: his rep.</p>
<p>(whispering): Rep means reputation.</p>
<p>To do that, we got to go to the ultimate expert on urban culture.</p>
<p><em>A white nerd.</em></p>
<p>So, in South Central Springfield in the '90s, there were four major hip-hop sub-scenes.</p>
<p>The Good Time Mafia, Licorice Avenue, The Dirty, Dirty North, and The FLTA.</p>
<p>The Fine Ladies Thug Army.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>Yes, yes. But do you have anything we can use against my sworn enemy, Jay G?</p>
<p>Before he was Jay G, he was Jeremy Gilroy, a founding member of The Five Boyfriends, a soulful R&amp;B quintet.</p>
<p>Hey, I know this guy.</p>
<p>He tried to sell me a $55 candle!</p>
<p>That's Jazzy James, the Lyrical Miracle.</p>
<p>He wrote all of Jay's early hits.</p>
<p>But they had a falling out, and he was never heard from again.</p>
<p>Then only one man can write the rap that will ruin the rep of Jay G.</p>
<p>Jazzy James.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: <em>I told you this guy would come back.</p>
<p>Told you.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, I used to be Jazzy James.</p>
<p>The Lyrical Miracle?</p>
<p>My k*ll were empirical.</p>
<p>I wrote all the rhymes for Jay G's first hip-hop record.</p>
<p>I didn't get a dime, because I signed over all the rights.</p>
<p>Why'd you do that?</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>All right, all right.</p>
<p>I'll sign!</p>
<p>He took my money, stole my girl, made me get a tattoo of the baseball from<em> Major League.</em></p>
<p>It broke me. I fell hard, into scented candles.</p>
<p>(inhales deeply)</p>
<p>(exhales) Quince.</p>
<p>Listen, Jazzy. We're gonna tear down Jay G with the ultimate revenge rap.</p>
<p>And you're gonna write it.</p>
<p>Oh... (grunts)</p>

<p>Homie, it's so sweet of you to come visit me at my store.</p>
<p>But aren't you gonna get in trouble for missing work?</p>
<p>You let me worry about the nuclear plant.</p>
<p>The important thing for you to do is believe I still work there.</p>
<p>I can't wait to show you the changes I've made.</p>
<p>We're getting a lot of foot traffic.</p>
<p>Three people used the bathroom yesterday.</p>
<p>How much should I charge for these handbags made from the speaker covers of old jukeboxes?</p>
<p>Five dollars. No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>A hundred dollars! (gasps)</p>
<p>It's happening. It's happening.</p>
<p>I love my store!</p>

<p>Is Mom gonna be okay?</p>
<p>I don't know, son, I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Oh, it's not her, fellas.</p>
<p>It's the curse of the adorable little store.</p>
<p>Didn't always used to be like this. No, no.</p>
<p>Once, this land was full of actual stores, as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p>Then the rich people came. They didn't need to make money, they just needed a place for their friends to wander into, after spin class.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's progress for you.</p>

<p>You're not mad?</p>
<p>Your heart told you to stick with Mr. Burns, and the thing I love about you most is you've got a heart as big as The Ritz.</p>
<p>Wow, Mom, you just made an F. Scott Fitzgerald reference.</p>
<p>Lisa, please, I did graduate high school.</p>
<p>(sighs)</p>
<p>I've just hatched a plan for the most delicious revenge.</p>
<p>Simpson, we must away.</p>
<p>Did you want to buy that?</p>
<p>Just looking.</p>
<p>We can't afford the store anymore!</p>
<p>Oh, thank God.</p>
<p>Ha! I'm free!</p>
<p>(grunts)</p>
<p>Well, before long, another aimless soul will open another adorable store here.</p>
<p>And when they do, Old Sam the Sign Hanger will be ready, with his level and his ladder.</p>
<p>Oh, why, here comes one now.</p>
<p>Oh, honey, isn't it darling?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>We finally found the Bookmark Barn.</p>
<p>(cackling)</p>
<p>Oh, this<em> is</em> Wicker Works.</p>
<p>We're gonna sell so many Yorkie sweaters.</p>
<p>We can use the contractor that did Karen's store.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: <em>Mr. Burns' plan was so horrifying, I could barely shut up and go along with it.</p>
<p>But I was the only friend he had left in the world and he was whipping me so hard.</em></p>
<p>Ow, ow!</p>
<p>Oh, Goosius.</p>
<p>Daddy's got your oatmeal.</p>
<p>Golden raisins, just the way you like 'em, baby.</p>
<p>Goosey!</p>
<p>(tires screech)</p>
<p>Where's my goose?</p>
<p>Why, he's right here.</p>
<p>Fancy a bite of roast Goosius?</p>
<p>You didn't!</p>
<p>(laughing): Oh, I did.</p>
<p>Mmm. A trifle fatty, but other than that, excellent.</p>
<p>Damn, I didn't think you had it in you, M.B.</p>
<p>(sobbing): Oh, man.</p>
<p>I don't want to live in a world without the mascot of my multinational empire.</p>
<p>(sobs)</p>
<p>(Goosius honking, Homer grunting)</p>
<p>Stop it!</p>
<p>I saved your life, you stupid duck!</p>
<p>Simpson, I told you to cook his goose.</p>
<p>I couldn't do it.</p>
<p>We just had our portrait done.</p>
<p>(honks)</p>
<p>Then, what did I eat?</p>
<p>Roast goose from the gas station.</p>
<p>Fine, then I'll k*ll it myself.</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>(honking)</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: <em>The two rivals found themselves doomed by the lusts that drive all men... money, power, and the pursuit of a goose.</em></p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>(honking)</p>
<p>Damn it, Monty, I don't want to die.</p>
<p>Well, if we have to end this way, at least it's of natural causes.</p>
<p>A business deal gone wrong.</p>
<p>(creaking)</p>
<p>(shouts)</p>
<p>Tell me, Jay.</p>
<p>Why'd you betray me?</p>
<p>We were kindred souls.</p>
<p>Brothers in avarice.</p>
<p>Why? Because you told me to!</p>
<p>In your own last chapter.</p>
<p>&quot;You will never be truly ruthless until you destroy the one who made you.&quot;</p>
<p>I had to tear you down, M.B.!</p>
<p>It was the final rung.</p>
<p>(creaking)</p>
<p>I just wanted to be ruthless, like you.</p>
<p>That I inspired you to such pure and evil greed, that is my greatest triumph.</p>
<p>I am truly immortal.</p>
<p>We're about to die, fool.</p>
<p>(yelling)</p>
<p>Smithers, I ordered ice, not slush.</p>
<p>Sorry I'm late, sir.</p>
<p>A few of these French Canadian bikers got delayed at the border.</p>
<p>Apparently, I'm their leader now.</p>
<p>Smithers, Smithers, Smithers!</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>Ow. That stings.</p>
<p>Oh, that one's nice.</p>
<p>How dare you.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: <em>Mr. Burns realized that his ruthless will to power would b*at on forever in another man's heart.</em></p>
<p>Ah, I guess this summer's really over.</p>
<p>(crying): I'm gonna miss Goosius.</p>
<p>Aah!</p>
<p>Thanks, boy.</p>
<p>Do you think Mr. Burns learned anything from all this?</p>
<p>Could it have changed him for the better?</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p><em>I have a feeling it did.</em></p>
<p><strong>Burns (over P.A.)</strong>: Attention.</p>
<p>For the sheer joy of it, every day will now include a moment of musical appreciation.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>♪ Music makes the whole world ♪<br />
♪<em> Whole world</em> ♪</p>
<p>Mm, let's not do this tomorrow.</p>
<p>♪ Oh ♪<br />
♪ Go round, hey ♪<br />
♪ Ah-ah-ha. ♪</p>
