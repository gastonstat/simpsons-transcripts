The Princess Guide<br />
Original Air Date on March 1, 2015</p>
<p>Okay, Dad, I'm ready for Take Your Daughter to Work Day.</p>
<p>How come there's never a Take Your Son to Work Day?</p>
<p>'Cause boys are already on track to get all the good jobs.</p>
<p><em>The Dirty Dozen?</em></p>
<p>All guys.</p>
<p><em>Twelve Angry Men?</em> Uh, men!</p>
<p><em>The X-Men?</em> Mostly men.</p>
<p>(Bart and Homer laugh)</p>
<p>Good one, Dad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, despite all that, today's going to be fun, Dad!</p>
<p>Will there be lots of other girls there?</p>
<p>Just a few. For some reason, there's been a lot of infertility at the nuclear plant.</p>
<p>After we show you the wealth of jobs in the steno pool, a hearty luncheon of bison with lake beaver will be served.</p>
<p><strong>Girls</strong>: Ew!</p>
<p>And upon leaving, you will each receive a piece of orangewood to bite down on during childbirth.</p>
<p>(chuckles) Excellent.</p>
<p>(person applauds)</p>
<p>It's getting harder and harder to maintain my sunny disposition, Smithers.</p>
<p>Oh, you're always my ray of...</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Dad, what does that do?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Who's that guy?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Where do those pipes lead?</p>
<p>Not sure.</p>
<p>Is it called the cooling tower because there's...</p>
<p>Not my department.</p>
<p>How many kilowatts are...?</p>
<p>Look, sweetie, would you like to go to the cafeteria and get some ice cream?</p>
<p>How many kinds are there?</p>
<p>12.</p>
<p>Curse that Elon Musk!</p>
<p>Thanks to that Earth-smooching buttinski, I'm on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>All I have left are the clothes on my back and the clones in my freezer.</p>
<p>43 is missing again.</p>
<p>I had to replace my beloved hounds with teacup poodles.</p>
<p>It's pathetic. Watch.</p>
<p>Release the hounds.</p>
<p>(barking)</p>
<p>(chuckling): Aw.</p>
<p>No. Help. Oh, stop.</p>
<p>Oh, spare me.</p>
<p>And all I got from Mr. Musk was an electric car, which I charge by stealing power from my nosy neighbor.</p>
<p>Hey, dippily-do, neighbor-oni!</p>
<p>Stupid Branson.</p>
<p>But I have a new scheme that will undo the terrible damage done by my other schemes.</p>
<p>I have an appointment with a Nigerian King to negotiate a uranium deal that will put me right back on top.</p>
<p>Huh. Nothing can stop you, sir.</p>
<p>But, uh, not that you're not at the top of your game.</p>
<p>Uh, what if you don't get the deal?</p>
<p>I'll just have to sell everything and move to the South Pacific with you.</p>
<p>What a grim fate that would be.</p>
<p>And with your omelet, would you like the fried potatoes or the mixed berries?</p>
<p>I'll have the berries.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>A terrible fate indeed, sir.</p>
<p>Oh, no. My almond milk leaked all over everything.</p>
<p>Dad, do you have anything I can eat?</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Oh, uh, I will turn this corn chip into a wonderful meal, using my greatest k*ll lunchroom trading!</p>
<p>Shut your eyes.</p>
<p>(&quot;The Thieving Magpie&quot; by Rossini plays)</p>
<p>Pretty impressive, Homer.</p>
<p>But what about the presentation?</p>
<p>The eyes taste first, then lips, then palette.</p>
<p>Then the body's harshest critic-- the colon.</p>
<p>(Rossini's &quot;Thieving Magpie&quot; plays)</p>
<p>Okay, sweetie, open those baby blacks.</p>
<p>(gasps) Wow, Dad.</p>
<p>(giggles)</p>
<p>Thank you. Ooh.</p>
<p>Welcome, Your Majesty.</p>
<p>Mr. Burns, I don't know what you have heard, but I do not eat monkey brains from a skull.</p>
<p>Oh, this is for me.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I have a favor to ask.</p>
<p>(sucking through straw)</p>
<p>My daughter is traveling with me.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>She is my true treasure.</p>
<p>During our complicated negotiations, I need someone to look after her, keep her out of trouble.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>That man is the perfect choice.</p>
<p>What?! Sir, that's Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>You forgot that he's the most incompetent...</p>
<p>(both laughing)</p>
<p>Homer Simpson would be perfect.</p>
<p>Simpson, all you have to do is babysit the princess-- keeping her in this hotel room during the negotiations.</p>
<p>Babysitting, eh?</p>
<p>What do I know about kids?</p>
<p>Homer Simpson, I give you Princess Kemi of Nigeria!</p>
<p>Watch that girl like a hawk.</p>
<p>(screams)</p>
<p>Princess, why'd you put on that coat?</p>
<p>You're obviously cold.</p>
<p>May I escort you to the radiator?</p>
<p>No. I want to go out.</p>
<p>I'm 25 years old.</p>
<p>(phone ringing)</p>
<p>Uh, just a second.</p>
<p>Hey, Marge.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm working late.</p>
<p>Yup, special project.</p>
<p>Lenny said you were babysitting, and if you are babysitting, why can't you do some at home?</p>
<p>I could use a night out.</p>
<p>Sorry, Marge, but I am the royal babysitter.</p>
<p>If I start watching commoners, the tongues of the court will be awag.</p>
<p>Really? Awag? Really?</p>
<p>Well, if you think that...</p>
<p>(beeps off)</p>
<p>I want to go out and see the America whose greatest cities I've only seen destroyed in movies.</p>
<p>I see. You want excitement.</p>
<p>Princess, have you ever heard of Studio 54, CBGBs, the Roxbury?</p>
<p>Yes! I've dreamed of...</p>
<p>All gone.</p>
<p>But in their place, we have 500 channels of television.</p>
<p>All awesome.</p>
<p>Sit down, and I'll show you.</p>
<p>So, all these concubines belong to this one tyrant?</p>
<p>He's called &quot;The Bachelor.&quot;</p>
<p>Please let me go out.</p>
<p>All right, Princess.</p>
<p>I'll take you to a place that's fun with a capital &quot;F.&quot;</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>Moe, this is Kemi.</p>
<p>She's an honest-to-God princess.</p>
<p>Ah, really?</p>
<p>Hey, tell me something.</p>
<p>I heard that Queen Elizabeth in person is actually not that funny.</p>
<p>I am from Africa.</p>
<p>Wow, Africa.</p>
<p>I had a good friend who really wanted to go there.</p>
<p>So, uh, you speak English there?</p>
<p>I speak five languages.</p>
<p>(sputters) Nobody does.</p>
<p>(speaking Portuguese)</p>
<p>(speaking French)</p>
<p>(speaking Spanish)</p>
<p>(speaking Japanese)</p>
<p>Uh, which means what?</p>
<p>&quot;I don't wish to show off.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeah, that's pretty good there, uh, but don't expect me to bow and scrape.</p>
<p>Uh, well, I'll give you one scrape.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's it, Majesty.</p>
<p>Notice I didn't say &quot;Your.&quot;</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>Oh, they don't make them like you in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Nigeria?</p>
<p>Homer, can I speak to you in private?</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>Can I try it?</p>
<p>Ah, you got to be mad at something.</p>
<p>Well, I'm mad I'm not doing it.</p>
<p>Okay, I'll tell you why I'm mad.</p>
<p>A few months back, I got an unsolicited e-mail from an actual Nigerian prince.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p><em>The prince needed to transfer $40 million out of the country.</p>
<p>He offered to split that with me if I paid the five grand for the transfer fees.</em></p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: <em>And you gave it to him?</em></p>
<p><strong>Moe</strong>: <em>Yeah, I did.</p>
<p>I was sure the guy was on the level because of his bad spelling and grammar.</em></p>
<p>Now, guess how much of the $20 million I saw?</p>
<p>$8 million?</p>
<p>Ze-ro.</p>
<p>Get out of here!</p>
<p>If Kemi there is a Nigerian princess, her brother just might be the Nigerian prince that took my money!</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Listen, Moe, I'm Kemi's guardian.</p>
<p>She and I are going back to the hotel now!</p>
<p>(gasps) She's gone!</p>
<p>And she trashed my bar!</p>
<p>Oh, no, wait. She actually cleaned up a little bit.</p>
<p>Yeah, good for her.</p>
<p>(panting): Chief, thank God!</p>
<p>I was drinking at Moe's, and I lost an African princess!</p>
<p>Lost African princess, eh?</p>
<p>Well, lucky for you, she just happens to be in the back of my cruiser.</p>
<p>Yes! The prayer I forgot to say has been answered.</p>
<p>What the...?</p>
<p>You're going straight to the drunk t*nk, rummy.</p>
<p>&quot;African princess.&quot;</p>
<p>(distant g*n)</p>
<p>Chief, I just saw someone robbin' the Kwik-E-Mart!</p>
<p>Oh, now African princesses are robbing the Kwik-E-Mart, huh?</p>
<p>Get in the car, booze bag.</p>
<p>Chief, I have been sh*t in the shoulder!</p>
<p>In the car!</p>
<p>What is this, St. Patrick's Day?</p>
<p>Why, this is terrible.</p>
<p>Can't even think of anything to mumble to myself.</p>
<p>That's how upset I am here.</p>
<p>Hello. First of all, I wanted to pay.</p>
<p>Also... maybe... I wanted to talk more to you?</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content"><br />

<p><em>Okay there, Moe, you got to get to the brother, because he knows what my PIN number is, and I forgot.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, duly noted.</p>
<p>Uh, so, Your Tootsieness, tell me about your family.</p>
<p>Got any aunts, uncles, cousins, sisters... brothers?</p>
<p>I have a brother.</p>
<p>Yes. One.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p><em>Now, Moe, don't jump to conclusions.</p>
<p>A lot of people have brothers.</em></p>
<p>Does he have a computer?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Moe</strong>: <em>It's him!</em></p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: <em>Guys,</em> thanks for bailing me out, but I still have a huge problem.</p>
<p>Well, till we find her, maybe we could get somebody to pretend to be her.</p>
<p>You know, get a nice wig and a dress.</p>
<p>Oh, no, I am not dressing up like an African princess.</p>
<p>I am not! I am not! I am not!</p>
<p>Thank you for listening to my objections.</p>
<p>Well, you were really vehement.</p>
<p>(phone ringing)</p>
<p>Uh, hello, Simpson.</p>
<p>Just checking up.</p>
<p>May I speak with the princess?</p>
<p>Um, yeah, sure. Uh...</p>
<p>(high-pitched Southern accent): Hello, this is the princess.</p>
<p>I'm with Homer Simpson, and I do declare he's wonderful.</p>
<p>Oh, that's right, I'm from South Africa.</p>
<p>Fiddle-Dee-Dee.</p>
<p>(laughing): Well, sounds like everything's going just the way I want it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so all my money's tied up in this &quot;jernt.&quot;</p>
<p>Can't even afford elocution lessons to teach me how to pronounce &quot;joint.&quot;</p>
<p>I guess I could do it online, but, uh, what's the &quot;pernt&quot;?</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>What-What's so funny?</p>
<p>I thought my English was perfect, but you make me feel even better about it.</p>
<p>(chuckles) Eh, usually people that tease me get thrown out on their ass.</p>
<p>But, uh, your sayin' it made me feel good.</p>
<p>Geez, I sound like one of those guys in them Rom coms that play at the theaters next to the theater I'm in. Heh.</p>
<p>So, uh, what's a &quot;princessess&quot; like you, uh, do all day, huh?</p>
<p>A lot of spinning wheels and witches treating you like crap?</p>
<p>I read. Are you familiar with the books by my countryman Chinua Achebe, <em>Things Fall Apart</em> and<em> No Longer At Ease?</em></p>
<p>Hey, you guys got real optimistic literature there.</p>
<p>(giggles) Fair comment.</p>
<p>(yawns) I haven't eaten all day.</p>
<p>Well, don't eat those eggs!</p>
<p>Uh, we don't know what kind of bird they turn into.</p>
<p>But there's a string cheese or something in the fridge in the back.</p>
<p>Uh, help yourself.</p>
<p>All right, after she eats, I'd better close up.</p>
<p>(yawns) Oh. Come on, pal.</p>
<p>(grunts) Come on.</p>
<p>That's really stuck there good.</p>
<p>Ah, I can't be mad at her no more.</p>
<p>Good night, moon.</p>
<p>Good night, broom.</p>
<p>Good night, jukebox that won't play a tune.</p>
<p>Good night, eggs.</p>
<p>Good night, dregs.</p>
<p>Good night, bugs crawlin' up my legs.</p>
<p>Good night, beer.</p>
<p>Good night, mice.</p>
<p>Good night, princess who treats me nice.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>(yawns)</p>
<p>So my offer for one ton of your uranium is a goat.</p>
<p>Will you stop offering me that?</p>
<p>I come from a modern nation of 90 million people.</p>
<p>Two goats.</p>
<p>You are starting to insult me.</p>
<p>All right, let's cut to the chase.</p>
<p>My board has given me permission to go up to 12 goats.</p>
<p>(grumbles)</p>
<p>How about here, sir?</p>
<p>Looks good to me.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry I pretended not to be gay for all those years.</p>
<p>Well, better an old queen than never a queen at all.</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>Pay attention.</p>
<p>My last offer: 20 million goats.</p>
<p>Okay, but no dogs disguised as goats.</p>
<p>Oh, great, here comes the haggling.</p>
<p>Well, well, look who's up. Heh.</p>
<p>Uh, Princess, I'm gonna do something for you I've never done for anyone in this bar. Call you a cab.</p>
<p>No. I want to spend time with you.</p>
<p>I want to see this town.</p>
<p>Do you mind ridin' a cute little scooter with your arms around my waist?</p>
<p>I don't.</p>
<p>To the scooter store.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>And after you eat the soup you can eat the bowl or you can put &quot;kerns&quot; in it.</p>
<p>What, uh, whatever you like.</p>
<p>I have a confession to make.</p>
<p>This is my first montage.</p>
<p>Just relax and enjoy the music.</p>
<p>Moe Szyslak.</p>
<p>This is the part of the fairy tale where the princess goes back to the hotel and watches TV.</p>
<p>Come with me.</p>
<p>So where are we headed, dude?</p>
<p>Just go and go fast.</p>
<p>Okay, um, usually I do kind of a funny take on an airline pilot greeting the passengers. You know, like, &quot;Hey. Thank you &quot;for flying Air Kevin.</p>
<p>If you look out to the left of the pedicab, you...&quot;</p>
<p>Just move the pedals.</p>
<p>Whoa, sounds like the tower has cleared us for takeoff.</p>
<p>We're tryin' to escape that guy.</p>
<p>Well, dude, as long as he can run, he can b*at us.</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>So, anyways, the place that I really feel the pedaling?</p>
<p>It's my legs.</p>
<p>Okay, all right, we're safe.</p>
<p>Actually, I wanted to go back with him.</p>
<p>I don't want to get my father mad, O.</p>
<p>Go back? But I didn't show you the place where Dave Grohl got mugged.</p>
<p>I have to leave, but I still had a wonderful day.</p>
<p><strong>Moe</strong>: <em>Thank God I shaved my forehead this morning.</em></p>
<p>(gasps) A paparazzo.</p>
<p>Please don't send that.</p>
<p>If my father sees it, it will ruin my life.</p>
<p>Well, thanks for making it so easy.</p>
<p>And you have the 20 million goats?</p>
<p>Two, now.</p>
<p>19,999,998 on delivery.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>Um, shouldn't we see how the princess is doing before you sign, Your Majesty?</p>
<p>What are you talking about, Smithers?</p>
<p>(phone dings)</p>
<p>(gasps) I can't even trust you to watch an impetuous adult who does what she wants.</p>
<p>The deal is off.</p>
<p><strong>Smithers</strong>: <em>Wow. After spending my life serving others, I'm finally gonna get what I want.</em></p>
<p>Uh, uh, sir, there may be a bright side.</p>
<p>There's never a bright side.</p>
<p><strong>Smithers (chuckles)</strong>: <em>He's almost mine.</em></p>
<p>Yes, you've torn that up, all right.</p>
<p>Father, I want to explain.</p>
<p>I was a young woman who wanted to see the world, and this kind man has shown it to me.</p>
<p>And stolen your heart.</p>
<p>Eh, well, that's what I do. Uh, sorry, but there ain't no off switch for this.</p>
<p>(laughs) He has not stolen my heart.</p>
<p>Wha?!</p>
<p>Why has he made the ancient tribal sound of confusion?</p>
<p>I think he is a sweet, sweet man.</p>
<p>But when I kissed him on the forehead, it was not romantic.</p>
<p>More like when Snow White kissed Dopey.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, not this comparison again.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Moe.</p>
<p>I don't love you.</p>
<p>But I really like you.</p>
<p>Well, daughter, even though you have done nothing seriously wrong, first I will tear this contract one more time. (grunts)</p>
<p>And as for you, your punishment will be...</p>
<p>Uh, may I speak to you, Majesty, father to father?</p>
<p>A woman has allowed you to sire her children?</p>
<p>There was beer involved.</p>
<p>I have two daughters.</p>
<p>And I've learned you have to let them go their own way.</p>
<p>Even the one-year-old.</p>
<p>Majesty.</p>
<p>And the older one, I can't tell her what to do.</p>
<p>And she's only 12.</p>
<p>Eight.</p>
<p>See what I mean?</p>
<p>Always an argument.</p>
<p>But the thing you have to remember is that you have to let them be who they are because you love them.</p>
<p>I am not convinced.</p>
<p>Uh, because you want them to grow.</p>
<p>Still not convinced.</p>
<p>And because you can't strangle a girl.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>Come here, daughter.</p>
<p>Oh, father.</p>
<p>Little girl, let me give you some advice.</p>
<p>Never dream big, because it will blow up in your face.</p>
<p>You're talking to the girl who wants a career in jazz.</p>
<p>Oh, poor thing.</p>
<p>So the good king's cheap uranium will allow me to sell you expensive nuclear power.</p>
<p>Everyone wins.</p>
<p>Yes, yes. Princess.</p>
<p>Can you tell us about the man you kissed?</p>
<p><strong>Moe</strong>: Uh, yeah, I'll field that.</p>
<p>Uh, yesterday, a local man &quot;may or may not&quot; have given a tour to a certain princess, who, uh, one assumes, turned all his thoughts of revenge to love and then love to respect.</p>
<p>And yesterday, a certain princess may or may not have seen much of your world with a certain man, and she certainly might be eternally grateful.</p>
<p>Oh, this is vague stuff.</p>
<p>Vague stuff!</p>
<p>I did not think this through.</p>
<p>Moe, before I left, I just wanted to give you these examples of our most beloved, albeit depressing, literature.</p>
<p>Ah, some nice bedtime readin'.</p>
<p>Fun premise.</p>
<p>I'm laughing already.</p>
<p>Really not cheerin' me up here, but, uh, let me offer you the only literature in this bar-- sure works for me, though.</p>
<p>This coaster.</p>
<p>I will treasure it.</p>
<p>Well, I guess you'll pine forever for a man who doesn't care, while I just grow old here in this bar.</p>
<p>Yeah. Here's to suffering in silence.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Mm. Can't wait to see those numbers hanging from my rafters.</p>
<p>(sighs) I can't believe it's been three years since Smithers left.</p>
<p>Man, have I been aging badly.</p>
<p>But I guess I can finally wash this forehead.</p>
<p>Oh, divine.</p>
<p>(doorbell ringing)</p>
<p>Oh, God, what do you want?</p>
<p>Well, neighbor, now that your streak of rum luck is at its end, I have a favor to ask.</p>
<p>It involves charity.</p>
<p>I've set up the Virgin Earth Challenge, a $25 million prize to eliminate greenhouse gases, that I was hoping you would add to.</p>
<p>Where are the hounds when I need them?</p>
<p>They're on a free Virgin Galactic flight around the world.</p>
<p>Can you go five blasted minutes without saying the word &quot;virgin&quot;?</p>
<p>That's another Virgin Challenge.</p>
<p>That I will not be Virgin taking. Virgin.</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
