<p>WILLIE: Everyone, out of my kitchen!   </p>
<p>Brandine, do I come off as a yokel or a hayseed?   </p>
<p>Well, you are versatile, darlin'.   </p>
<p>You can play anyone in the trailer trash spectrum.   </p>
<p>A-yeah, I'm a regular Benedict Cabbage-Patch.   </p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]   </p>

<p>Community thespians, today we return to turn-of-the-century Oklahoma.   </p>
<p>Farm boys are farming. Cowboys are cowing.   </p>
<p>And, Carl, do you think your character Ike Skidmore is bringing his cell phone to the box social in     ?   </p>
<p>I see him as a forward-thinking guy, a tech first adopter.   </p>
<p>You know how I see him?<br />
Not played by you!   </p>
<p>Lenny, get yourself out of that horse's patoot.   </p>
<p>You're Ike Skidmore.   </p>
<p>Yee-haw! A speaking part!   </p>
<p>This is gonna be tan-fastic.   </p>
<p>Geez, don't make it into a song and dance.   </p>

<p>My spur's stuck in my eye!   </p>
<p>Carl, you're back in.   </p>
<p>Well, only with Lenny's blessing.   </p>
<p>- You don't have it.<br />
- I'm doing it anyway.   </p>
<p>Okay, Marge, this is your big song number.   </p>
<p>You're Ado Annie, the girl who cain't say no.   </p>
<p>Now, do you have any qualms about playing this part?   </p>
<p>- No.<br />
- Wrong, wrong! You cain't say no.   </p>
<p>Now, where's my handsome Curly?   </p>
<p>Right here.   </p>
<p>Now, this I can work with.   </p>
<p>HOMER: Okay, Maggie,   </p>
<p>what shall we do while Mommy rehearses?   </p>
<p>The dog track is closed.   </p>
<p>You can come visit me!   </p>
<p>I didn't hear that.   </p>
<p>Hmm, what shall we do?   </p>
<p>Why is this place so popular?   </p>
<p>Do they serve booze?<br />
Is it a baby fight club?   </p>
<p>Is there a big-screen TV?   </p>

Are there free doughnuts?   </p>

<p>[BABY TALK]: We're going to find out.   </p>

<p>You'll understand everything when Chloe comes out.   </p>

<p>I borrowed my granddaughter just for this.   </p>

<p>Maggie! How long have you been here?   </p>
<p>♪   </p>
<p>Why does this line say &quot;Curt&quot; when I'm talking to Curly?   </p>
<p>No, you see, &quot;curt&quot; is in parentheses.   </p>
<p>It tells you how to say the line.   </p>
<p>Obviously lying... yeah, no, I knew that.   </p>
<p>Impressed noise.<br />
You really know your stuff.   </p>
<p>Okay, actors, in the words of William Shakespeare, find your &quot;X&quot; and shut up.   </p>
<p>Geez, all right, easy.   </p>
<p>All I ask is that you give me the performance   </p>
<p>I have pictured in my head but have not communicated to you.   </p>
<p>Our curtain opens on sun-drenched fields of undulating golden corn.   </p>
<p>♪ O... ♪   </p>
<p>Stop, stop, stop!   </p>
<p>This set is terrible.   </p>
<p>That corn isn't as high as an elephant's eye.   </p>
<p>Oh, you wanted the corn to be high.   </p>
<p>I have never seen such incompetence and idiocy in a theater.   </p>
<p>You have made me hate you all.   </p>
<p>Excuse my salty language in front of Aunt Eller, but why don't you just take a hike?   </p>
<p>[GASPS] Oh.   </p>
<p>Get lost.   </p>
<p>Losing temper, we don't want you here.    </p>
<p>Turns to cast, I saved the play.    </p>
<p>Marge, surely you want me to stay.    </p>
<p>Actually, no.    </p>
<p>For the last time, that's the one word you cain't say.    </p>
<p>This is mine. I brought it from home.    </p>

<p>[INDISTINCT YELLING]    </p>
<p>Just listen to me!    </p>
<p>What if I directed the play?    </p>
<p>Hey, that's a good idea. I mean, she directs Homer and the kids out of the house every morning.    </p>
<p>And I direct traffic.    </p>
<p>That's a stupid analogy.    </p>
<p>I think Marge makes us all feel good about ourselves.    </p>
<p>[SIGHS]: Mmm.    </p>
<p>Yelling in unison.    </p>
<p>ALL: Marge! Marge! Marge! Yay!    </p>

<p>All right, you asked for it.    </p>
<p>Uh, wh-wh-who wants Oklahoma! tickets? Front row.    </p>
<p>I can get you three together.    </p>
<p>♪    </p>
<p>[GROANS] This is a really complicated show.    </p>
<p>So much gingham.    </p>
<p>We need a show that we can actually pull off in Springfield.    </p>
<p>Small cast, simple sets, and some hip-hop, but not real hip-hop.    </p>
<p>Great, but I got to be someplace, so, real quick, the best kind of original show is one that rips off a big hit.<br />
What's the biggest hit?    </p>
<p>Hellzapoppin'!    </p>
<p>No, Hamilton by Lin-Manuel Miranda.    </p>
<p>Oh, the guy from In the Heights.    </p>
<p>Now, how did I know that? I'm back!    </p>
<p>All right, who's our Alexander Hamilton?    </p>
<p>That would be me.<br />
Thanks to this furnace filter, you won't be saying &quot;burr&quot; anymore.    </p>
<p>No, our most famous historical figure...    </p>
<p>[GASPS] Jebediah Springfield!    </p>
<p>I'll write a musical biography, warts and all.    </p>
<p>I can't see how that could fail.    </p>
<p>Now I'm in a hurry... Maggie and I have a Daddy and Me class.    </p>
<p>Aren't you forgetting something?    </p>
<p>Keys, wallet, I don't think so.    </p>
<p>[CHUCKLING]: Oh, sure.<br />
I'm happy to take Maggie.    </p>
<p>You sure like that class.    </p>
<p>Oh, uh, some dads just love to be with their little girls.    </p>
<p>- Can I go?<br />
- Sorry, no.    </p>

<p>Our new production will be Bloody Bloody Jebediah, a hip-hop musical about our city's founder.    </p>
<p>Is it respectful?    </p>
<p>Not entirely.    </p>
<p>What?!    </p>
<p>Why don't we start by going around the circle and saying what parts we're playing.    </p>
<p>I'm Marge, the director.    </p>
<p>Luann, Jebediah's wife.    </p>
<p>Carl, Quarrelsome Settler. I got a bone to pick with this part.    </p>

<p>- [GROANS]<br />
- Krusty, what's wrong?    </p>
<p>It's happened... the worst possible thing that can happen to a performer.    </p>
<p>What do you mean?    </p>
<p>I'm in an article entitled, &quot;Where Are They Now?&quot;    </p>
<p>[SOBS]    </p>
<p>Right above Judd Nelson and New Coke.    </p>
<p>I'll tell you where Judd Nelson is.    </p>
<p>He's on my show tonight. [SOBS]    </p>
<p>Ah. Fantastic!    </p>
<p>What's that thing you were doing?    </p>
<p>Oh, uh, local theater.<br />
You wouldn't be interested.    </p>
<p>Hey, I'm a performer, an artist, which means I'm always interested in money.    </p>
<p>Live theater is the only thing getting ratings these days.    </p>
<p>Who owns the rights?    </p>
<p>A Mrs. Marge Simpson.    </p>
<p>Oh, really?<br />
Let's see what kind of bargain    </p>
<p>Mrs. Marge Simpson drives.    </p>
<p>So you'll get   % of the profits while I get foreign distribution rights in Venezuela for a window of three weeks.    </p>
<p>[CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY, GROANS]    </p>
<p>So my little show's gonna be on TV live?    </p>
<p>Yep. This is the first time a woman has signed something with me where I didn't lose custody of something.    </p>
<p>So where will we stage it?    </p>
<p>Outside, where the lighting is free.    </p>
<p>Ooh, are you sure that's not risky?    </p>
<p>Well, some would say I'm taking a risk with an original play and a first-time director, but show business is based on risks.    </p>
<p>Risks and comic books. Excuse me.    </p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]    </p>
<p>So, Marge, are you ready to beg me to come back?    </p>
<p>Actually, Llewellyn, we're doing fine on our own.    </p>
<p>No need to grovel. You don't actually have to say anything.    </p>
<p>Okay, fine, I'll come back.    </p>
<p>No one's asking you to come back.    </p>
<p>You know what? Just for that, I won't come back.    </p>
<p>Fine.    </p>
<p>Please, I'm begging you, take me back.    </p>
<p>All right, but beware, hell hath no fury like a director scorned.    </p>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to sneak my headshot onto the wall.    </p>
<p>And poof.    </p>
<p>You're flushed, Plummer.    </p>
<p>I hired you to bus tables.    </p>
<p>- Hmm?<br />
- I'm researching a role.    </p>
<p>[CHOMPS]    </p>
<p>Now, Mom, before you go into that production meeting,    </p>
<p>I want to pass along a quote from F. Scott Fitzgerald.    </p>
<p>&quot;Great art is the contempt of a great woman for small art.&quot;    </p>
<p>He actually said &quot;man,&quot; but he'd have wanted me to change it.    </p>
<p>Didn't he also say, &quot;Show me a hero and I'll write you a tragedy&quot;?    </p>
<p>Yes, but he also said,    </p>
<p>&quot;Never confuse a single defeat with a final defeat.&quot;    </p>
<p>But didn't he also say, &quot;There are no second acts in American lives&quot;?    </p>
<p>Just get in the meeting!    </p>
<p>The bagels are getting hard.    </p>
<p>[GRUNTS HAPPILY]    </p>
<p>[DOORBELL RINGS]    </p>
<p>[CHUCKLES] There's my Jebediah.    </p>
<p>Marge, I'm leaving the show to fulfill a lifelong dream... playing Prospero in The Tempest.    </p>
<p>You can't quit now.    </p>
<p>We're live in three days.    </p>
<p>We have no understudy.    </p>

<p>You are a great father.    </p>
<p>Oh, I wish I felt like a great director.    </p>
<p>Fine, if you want me to quit the class, I'll do it.    </p>
<p>Who said anything about quitting?    </p>
<p>I've had enough people quit on me today.    </p>
<p>Marge, anyone who can raise two girls and two boys the way you're doing can do anything.    </p>
<p>You're gonna make it.    </p>
<p>I've got a special announcement today.    </p>
<p>You're gonna wear the perfume I bought you?    </p>

<p>Maybe I have the cutest baby.    </p>

<p>No, he's playing Don Quixote in Man of La Mancha.    </p>
<p>Damn it. Why is this town's theater scene so vibrant?    </p>
<p>I'm here to audition for the part of Macbeth.    </p>
<p>It's not Macbeth.    </p>
<p>- Is it Macduff?<br />
- Not Macduff.    </p>
<p>Well, there's no other parts worth playing!    </p>
