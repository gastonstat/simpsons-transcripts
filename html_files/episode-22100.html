<p>Everything we pack in, we pack out.</p>
<p>What if I have to do my business?</p>
<p>Use this plastic bag.</p>
<p>Aw, how come bears can crap in the woods and I can't?</p>

<p>Sorry to break up your picnic, folks.</p>
<p>I'm two-time fast-car champ, Clay Babcock.</p>

<p>Yeah, I have won a lot of races. It's all thanks to my crew, really.</p>
<p>[ Grunts ] There it is.</p>
<p>Mr. Babcock, can I ride in your car?</p>
<p>Well, my &quot;A&quot; car was just incinerated, but, uh, you can ride in my &quot;B&quot; car.</p>
<p>[ Flame Roars ]</p>
<p>I don't see why not.</p>
<p>Bart, these are the &quot;time trials&quot;... that determine the &quot;pole position.&quot;</p>
<p>Shouldn't you be keeping your hands on the wheel?</p>
<p>Oh, sure, if you want to drive the &quot;traditional&quot; way.</p>
<p>[ Grinding Metal ]</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Boy, these cars are surprisingly roomy.</p>
<p>Yeah, we like to bring our families along on the longer races.</p>
<p>If I get tired, I let my wife drive. She's good.</p>
<p>Get your feet off the upholstery!</p>
<p>[ Engine Slows ]</p>
<p>I got some spare tickets if you'd like to stick around for the race.</p>
<p>That's very sweet, but we have a full day of hiking planned.</p>
<p>We can hike anytime.</p>
<p>This is our chance to see cars driving.</p>

<p>Well, I don't care for the speed... but I can't get enough of that safety gear-</p>

<p>Yes. Yes, I do.</p>
<p>Come on! Right here! [ Screams ]</p>
<p>[ Gasping ]</p>
<p>I'm okay, folks.</p>
<p>[ All Groan ]</p>
<p>I need a shirt! Give me a shirt!</p>
<p>Mommy has bosoms like that.</p>
<p>[ Chuckles ] Yeah, I wish.</p>
<p>Neddie, I've had about all I can take of Homer Simpson's torso.</p>
<p>I'll get some hot dogs.</p>
<p>No foot-longs.</p>
<p>I know. They make you uncomfortable.</p>
<p><em>Well, I guess no one else wants a T-shirt.</em></p>
<p>That's a damn lie, and you know it! Gimme a shirt!</p>

<p>Oh, my Lord, she's dead!</p>
<p>[ Groans ]</p>
<p>It's hard to believe we're never going to see Maude again.</p>
<p>And poor Ned didn't get a chance to say good-bye.</p>
<p>Well, from now on, I'm never gonna let you leave the room... without telling you how much I love you, and how truly special-</p>
<p>This is eating up a lot of time. Maybe just a pat on the butt.</p>
<p>[ Light Smack ]</p>
<p>Yeah, that works.</p>
<p>Now, Homie, you know, Ned and the boys need us. And you know what that means.</p>
<p>I know. No more being a jerk.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>[ Sniffles ]</p>
<p>In many ways, Maude Flanders was a supporting player in our lives.</p>
<p>She didn't grab our attention with memorable catchphrases... or comical accents.</p>
<p>Aye.</p>
<p>Yarr.</p>
<p>Oh, glavin! Why, glavin?</p>
<p>But, whether you noticed her or not, Maude was always there.</p>
<p>And we thought she always would be.</p>
<p>My friends, life is about change.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, Apu was a lonely bachelor.</p>
<p>[ Crying ]</p>
<p>Yes, thank God those days are over.</p>
<p>And the Van Houtens were enjoying a storybook marriage.</p>
<p>Yeah. Lots of storybooks have witches.</p>
<p>Shut up, Kirk!</p>
<p>[ Quickly ] Sorry.</p>
<p>And now, the good people at Fan-demonium, as part of a generous settlement... will fire a 21 T-shirt salute.</p>

<p><em>2 4 hours a day.</p>
<p>Oh, thank you, Apu.</em></p>
<p>And I'm going to give you all of Maude's frequent Squishy points.</p>
<p>The boys at headquarters will not like it... but I'm getting pretty sick of them and their b*mb attitude!</p>
<p>That's enough there, Apu. Look, Ned, I know we ain't hung out much... what with your insane fear of drinking... and me being banned from the church and all... but, uh, but that Maude, she was really somethin'.</p>
<p>Oh, wasn't she? Thank you, Moe. I appreciate that.</p>
<p>Oh, I really mean it though. I mean, if it was you that died, I would've been on her so fast!</p>
<p>What are you saying?</p>
<p>What? Nothing. She was hot.</p>
<p>What? You can't take a compliment?</p>
<p>Hot?</p>
<p>You monster! [ Grunting ]</p>
<p>That's good. No. Let it out. That's it. Let it out.</p>
<p>Send me to Maude. That's it. Here I come, baby. Oh, yeah!</p>

<p>[ Chuckles ] That's nice of you, Homer, but I think I'll just go to bed.</p>
<p>Then I insist on walking you home.</p>
<p>Homer, this really isn't necessary.</p>
<p>Those feelings are normal, Ned.</p>
<p>They're part of the process. Watch the sprinkler.</p>
<p>Hey! That's my sprinkler.</p>
<p>It's natural to feel that way.</p>

<p>Okay. Be right down.</p>
<p>[ Chuckles ]</p>
<p>I just keep replaying the whole thing in my head.</p>
<p>I can't believe my last words to Maude were, &quot;No foot-longs.&quot;</p>
<p>Yep. It would have been a lot better if you'd said...</p>
<p>&quot;I love you&quot; or, &quot;You're special.&quot;</p>
<p>You know, something sweet instead of that hot dog crack.</p>
<p>If I'd only been a gentlemen and got the hot dogs myself... she'd still be here.</p>
<p>Now, now, now. Don't b*at yourself up.</p>
<p>I'm the one who drove her out of her seat.</p>
<p>I'm the one who provoked the lethal barrage ofT-shirts.</p>
<p>I'm the one who parked in the ambulance zone, preventing any possible resuscitation.</p>
<p>Uh, but there's no point in playing the blame game.</p>
<p>Ah, you're right. I just gotta work through the grief.</p>
<p>There's not gonna be an easy answer.</p>

<p>Do you even have a job anymore?</p>
<p>I think it's pretty obvious that I don't!</p>

<p>Okay, from here we star wipe to a glamour sh*t of Flanders paying his bills.</p>
<p><em>Then we star wipe to Flanders brushing his-</em></p>

<p>Oh, it's been a hard couple of months... but I feel like I've turned a corner.</p>
<p>Well, that's all gonna change, thanks to this tape!</p>

<p>[ Chuckles ] He sure is. [ Growls ]</p>
<p>Okay Here goes nothing.</p>
<p>If you select me you'll get a lot more than a Wharton M.B.A. pulling in 200 K.</p>
<p>You'll get a woman who's poised, articulate... sophisticated, confident and highly sexual.</p>
<p>Hang on. I'm getting a fax.</p>
<p>Damn, I've just been indicted.</p>
<p>Looks like we're gonna have to reschedule. How's your July?</p>
<p>Well, I-</p>
<p>Mine's terrible. Let's talk in August.</p>
<p>[ Sighs ]</p>
<p>Mmm. Dinner was delicious, Edna.</p>
<p>But I can't shake the feeling that you're just using me to get Principal Skinner jealous.</p>
<p>Oh, please. I don't care what Mr. &quot;Engaged to be Engaged&quot; thinks.</p>
<p>Hear that, Seymour?</p>
<p>[ Skinner] Edna, this is childish.</p>
<p>Fine, then hang up.</p>
<p><em>I will hang up when he leaves.</p>
<p>[ Sighs ]</em></p>
<p>Well, Diane, I've sure enjoyed chatting with you about your problems with your mother.</p>
<p>Did you hear that, Foofie? Sounds like somebody &quot;wuvs&quot; us.</p>
<p><em>Yes, it does.</p>
<p>[ Chuckles ] Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Well, maybe I'll call you again sometime.</p>
<p>Ooh. Foofie doesn't like the sound of that &quot;maybe.&quot;</p>
<p>'Cause him's a commitment dog, isn't him?</p>
<p>[ Gasping, Panting ]</p>
<p>So, how'd you do tonight, Romeo?</p>
<p>Well, I just can't relate to the women of today, Homer.</p>
<p>Ah, it's probably me. I'm about as exciting as a baked potato.</p>
<p>You're darn right you are! And you've got lots of other great qualities too!</p>
<p>That's right, Ned. Those floozies we married in Vegas were crazy about you.</p>
<p>What floozies? What are you talking-</p>
<p>Marge! We're trying to help Ned!</p>
<p>Lord, I never question you... but I've been wondering if your decision to take Maude was, well, wrong.</p>
<p>U-Unless this is part of your divine plan.</p>
<p>[ Clicks Tongue ] Could you just give me some kind of sign?</p>
<p>Anything?</p>
<p>Aw, and after all that church chocolate I bought... which, by the way, was gritty and had that white stuff on it!</p>
<p>Well, I've had it!</p>
<p>Daddy, get up. You'll be late for church.</p>
<p>Well, you boys can go with the Simpsons. I'm not going to church today.</p>
<p>[ Gasps ]</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>And I may not go to church tomorrow.</p>
<p>[ Whimpering, Screaming ]</p>
<p>No, I'm not kiddin'! I am gonna sit right here and miss church.</p>
<p>You just watch.</p>
<p>Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!</p>
<p>While our organist is on a much-needed vacation... we thought we'd try something new.</p>
<p>So get down and put your knees together for the Christian rock stylings of...</p>

<p>Oh, my gosh. Some dropouts must have overpowered the reverend.</p>
