							<p>Lisa's Wedding.</p>
<p>Zounds! I did thee mightily smitely.</p>
<p>&quot;Zounds&quot; is a Renaissance English word, short for &quot;God's wounds&quot;... but &quot;smitely,&quot; that's pure Flanders.</p>
<p>Please call a doctor.</p>
<p>These Renaissance fairs are so boring.</p>
<p>Oh, really? Did you see the loom?</p>
<p>I took loom in high school.</p>
<p>Yon meat 'tis sweet as summer's wafting breeze.</p>
<p>Can I have some?</p>
<p>Mine ears are open to the pleas... of those who speak ye old English.</p>
<p>Sweet maiden of the spit, grant now my boon, that I might sup... upon suckling pig this noon.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>I've eaten eight different meats. I'm a true Renaissance man.</p>
<p>I'll go to the first-aid tent and tell them to plug in ye old stomach pump.</p>
<p>Alight your gaze on yonder fabled beasts of yore.</p>
<p>Behold the rarest of the rare... the mythological two-headed hound, born with only one head.</p>
<p>And here, out of the mists of history, the legendary esquilax: A horse with the head of a rabbit and the body of a rabbit.</p>
<p>It's galloping away.</p>
<p>Here, bunny-bunny. Here, bunny.</p>
<p>Here, &quot;esquilax.&quot;</p>
<p>I've been waiting for you, Lisa.</p>
<p>How did you know my name?</p>
<p>Your nametag.</p>
<p>Would you like to know your future?</p>
<p>Sorry, I don't believe in fortunetelling. I should go.</p>
<p>What's your hurry? Bart, Maggie and Marge are at the joust.</p>
<p>And Homer is heckling the puppet show.</p>
<p>Wow, you can see into the present.</p>
<p>Now we'll see what the future holds.</p>
<p>The death card?</p>
<p>No, that's good.</p>
<p>It means transition, change.</p>
<p>That's cute.</p>
<p>The happy squirrel.</p>
<p>That's bad?</p>
<p>Possibly.</p>
<p>The cards are vague and mysterious.</p>
<p>They seem to be revealing the story of your first love.</p>
<p>Do you want me to continue?</p>
<p>Guess so.</p>
<p>It's...</p>
<p>It's coming to me. Yes.</p>
<p>I see an eastern university in the year 2010.</p>
<p>The world has become a very different place.</p>
<p>I can't wait to see that play.</p>
<p>Hey, watch it.</p>
<p>Watch it.</p>
<p>That man is instantly the most annoying person I've ever met.</p>
<p>A soy-based snack will calm me down.</p>
<p>Him again.</p>
<p>Hello. I need Ecosystem of the Marsh by Thompson.</p>
<p>The last copy was just signed out by... Hugh Parkfield.</p>
<p>Oh, there he is.</p>
<p>No. It couldn't be.</p>
<p>Thanks for holding my book while I tied my shoe.</p>
<p>That's the book I need. You'll probably take forever with it too.</p>
<p>I read faster.</p>
<p>I read at a 78th-grade level.</p>
<p>Right here.</p>
<p>Finished this page?</p>
<p>Ages ago.</p>
<p>I'll get the dictionary.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>You'll see. &quot;Stochastic.&quot;</p>
<p>Pertaining to a process... involving a randomly determined sequence of observations.</p>
<p>First, they hate each other. All of a sudden, they love each other.</p>
<p>Oh, it doesn't make any sense to me.</p>
<p>Of course not. You're a robot.</p>
<p>I never met anyone who so understood the magic of Jim Carrey.</p>
<p>He can make you laugh with no more than a frantic flailing of his limbs.</p>
<p>I can't believe how much we have in common.</p>
<p>We're studying the environment, we're utterly humorless about vegetarianism.</p>
<p>And we both love the Rolling Stones.</p>
<p>Yes. Not for their music but for their tireless efforts... to preserve historic buildings.</p>
<p>Lisa, I can't bear being apart all summer.</p>
<p>Come with me to Parkfield Manor.</p>
<p>I'd love to. Can we get vegetarian meals at your parents' house?</p>
<p>Yes, we can, Lisa.</p>
<p>That is good.</p>
<p>Because eating animals is wrong.</p>
<p>So very wrong.</p>
<p>When will the world learn?</p>
<p>I don't know. I just don't know.</p>
<p>I love these new planes.</p>
<p>Yes. It's a good thing they re-evaluated those wacky old designs.</p>
<p>Beautiful dinnerware, Mrs. Parkfield.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>They were made for the finest family in Britain.</p>
<p>I don't know how we ended up with them.</p>
<p>Should I laugh? Was that dry British wit or subtle self-pity?</p>
<p>They're staring at me. Better respond.</p>
<p>It's good to hear a boisterous American laugh.</p>
<p>And I love that painting. Judging by the clothes, I'd say 17th century.</p>
<p>Actually, Lisa, it's just Uncle Eldred.</p>
<p>I get me brain medicines from the National Health.</p>
<p>This place is so enchanting, Hugh. I love it here.</p>
<p>I wanted this to be perfect for you.</p>
<p>I know you Americans like everything to be... fireworks.</p>
<p>Oh, blast. Go to plan B.</p>
<p>Yes, I will.</p>
<p>Isn't it wonderful?</p>
<p>Master Hugh has found a true love.</p>
<p>Hi, Mom.</p>
<p>Lisa. Hello.</p>
<p>How are you doing in England? Remember, an elevator is a &quot;lift&quot;... a mile is called a &quot;kilometer,&quot; and botulism is &quot;steak-and-kidney pie.&quot;</p>
<p>Guess what. Hugh and I are getting married.</p>
<p>All right! Lisa, that's wonderful.</p>
<p>If only your father was still with us.</p>
<p>But he left for work a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>Remember we'd always plan my dream wedding, and you always promised... to, you know, well, keep Dad from ruining it?</p>
<p>Oh, don 't worry, honey. I guarantee your father will behave.</p>
<p>Mom, it's a Picturephone.</p>
<p>Oh, this? This?</p>
<p>Oh, no. I just got a touch of the rheumatiz.</p>
<p>Mom, Picturephone.</p>
<p>Hi, Mom. Oh, that's great news about Lisa.</p>
<p>Well, listen, I better get back to work.</p>
<p>They're finally paying me for this.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yes, but the international market is my focus.</p>
<p>Oh, Marge, that's great news.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, there with the personal calls, Simpson.</p>
<p>But, Mr. Milhouse, my little girl's getting married.</p>
<p>Lisa?</p>
<p>My one true love.</p>
<p>It's not you, Milhouse. I just don't plan to ever get married.</p>
<p>I think I'll write your performance evaluation now, Simpson.</p>
<p>I gotta call everyone and tell them the good news.</p>
<p>What the...?</p>
<p>Maggie, I need to use the phone.</p>
<p>Will that girl ever shut up?</p>
<p>I'll plan everything. We can have the reception at Moe's.</p>
<p>Why not have the whole wedding there. We'll do it on a Monday morning.</p>
<p>There'll be fewer drunks.</p>
<p>Don't take this personally.</p>
<p>I've obtained a court order to prevent you from planning this wedding.</p>
<p>&quot;Whereas Homer Simpson...&quot;</p>
<p>Well, these seem to be in order. I'll be in the hammock.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Smithers plus guest.&quot;</p>
<p>There's only one person I'd wanna bring.</p>
<p>Oh, Mr. Burns, we'll thaw you out the second they discover the cure... for 17 stab wounds in the back. How we doing, boys?</p>
<p>Well, we're up to 15.</p>
<p>If you have three Pepsis and drink one, how much more refreshed are you?</p>
<p>The redhead in the Chicago school system.</p>
<p>Pepsi?</p>
<p>Partial credit.</p>
<p>We're invited to the wedding of our only graduate to read at an adult level.</p>
<p>It must be Lisa Simpson.</p>
<p>Of course, Martin Prince perished in that science-fair expl*si*n.</p>
<p>Not quite perished, my lady love.</p>
<p>Although some days I wish I had.</p>
<p>Hey, I remember you. Mayor Quimby, right?</p>
<p>No. Look at this license. I'm Mohamed Jafar.</p>
<p>Quimby, after this fare, get your indicted ass to the convention center.</p>
<p>I cut the ribbon at that convention center.</p>
<p>Just a couple more blocks to my house.</p>
<p>Darling, don't worry. I'm sure I'll get along with your family.</p>
<p>You prepared me for the worst.</p>
<p>As long as they're not squatting in a ditch... poking berries up their noses.</p>
<p>And if they are?</p>
<p>Here they come. Raise the flag.</p>
<p>Oh, Lisa.</p>
<p>Yo, Hugh.</p>
<p>Here's a little bit of U.S. Hospitality.</p>
<p>What do you think of that?</p>
<p>Dad!</p>
<p>Now throw compost on it.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
<p>Still warm.</p>
<p>You can be the first to try out the new guest bedroom I built.</p>
<p>If the building inspector comes by, it's not a room, it's a window box.</p>
<p>Oh, Hugh, thank you.</p>
<p>You've been just wonderful through this entire ordeal.</p>
<p>Lisa, I love you so much. I'm willing to go through anything.</p>
<p>Are you okay?</p>
<p>I'm fine, Lisa.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the compost heap broke my fall.</p>
<p>Be a dear, run a bath.</p>
<p>Homer, Bart, Maggie, company eating rules.</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>Anyway, Hugh, there's more to my life than just the wrecking ball.</p>
<p>I also crush cars into cubes.</p>
<p>On the side, I promote local tough-man contests.</p>
<p>I'm getting out all my aggression till I go to law school.</p>
<p>So, Hugh, have you heard all the latest American jokes?</p>
<p>Here's a good one. Pull my finger.</p>
<p>Yes, we have that one in England too.</p>
<p>I said, pull my finger.</p>
<p>Mom, we've got my wedding-dress fitting this afternoon.</p>
<p>Maggie, if you're not doing anything, why don't you come.</p>
<p>Maggie, don't talk with your mouth full.</p>
<p>Me and Bart will take Hugh out this afternoon.</p>
<p>Hugh should take it easy because of his fall.</p>
<p>The only thing bruised in that fall was my spine.</p>
<p>I'll be delighted.</p>
<p><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content"><br />

<p><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div></p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>There's only one thing I ask in return.</p>
<p>Certainly.</p>
<p>Pull my finger.</p>
<p>So this driving on the left makes you feel more at home, huh, Hugh?</p>
<p>And tonight, the following celebrities have been arrested: Heather Locklear Fortensky remains at large.</p>
<p>Remember, if you see any celebrities, consider them dangerous.</p>
<p>You know, I rather like this pub.</p>
<p>An English boy, eh?</p>
<p>You know, we saved your ass in World w*r II.</p>
<p>Well, we saved your ass in World w*r III.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>There's something I want you to have.</p>
<p>My dad gave me his cuff links to wear on the day I married Marge.</p>
<p>They brought us good luck. I couldn't imagine a happier marriage.</p>
<p>We don't have many traditions in our family.</p>
<p>But it would mean a lot to me if you kept this one alive.</p>
<p>Well, I'd be honored... to wear those things.</p>
<p>Hey, watch those virtual darts.</p>
<p>I'm trying to play virtual pool.</p>
<p>Hey, hey. No fighting in my bar.</p>
<p>You know, Fox turned into a hardcore-sex channel so gradually... I didn't even notice.</p>
<p>It's so great to have the whole family together under one roof.</p>
<p>I never realized how much I missed it.</p>
<p>Listen to the murmurs in the next room. The house is full of life again.</p>
<p>Keep it down in there!</p>
<p>All right, Dad.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I left you alone with Homer and Bart.</p>
<p>No, no, honey. We had a fine time.</p>
<p>How'd you get that gash?</p>
<p>When we hid in the Dumpster... after the fire alarm went off in the pornographic-magazine warehouse.</p>
<p>You are so good to put up with all of this.</p>
<p>Oh, don't be silly, Lisa.</p>
<p>Everything's fine. Really.</p>
<p>Now, go to sleep. We have a big day ahead of us tomorrow.</p>
<p>A big, long day.</p>
<p>Lisa, I can't believe it's your wedding day already.</p>
<p>Mom, I feel kind of funny wearing white. I mean, Milhouse.</p>
<p>Oh, Milhouse doesn't count.</p>
<p>Okay, I've got something old, that's my pearl necklace.</p>
<p>Something new is the wedding dress.</p>
<p>Something borrowed is this antique brooch from Hugh's mother.</p>
<p>Now I just need something blue.</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>Oh, Mom, thanks.</p>
<p>Wow, Lisa. Looking at you makes me wanna get married for a third time.</p>
<p>I met a really nice exotic dancer at Hugh's bachelor party.</p>
<p>Hugh didn't have a bachelor party.</p>
<p>We had one in his honor.</p>
<p>I had one in his honor.</p>
<p>I went to a strip club.</p>
<p>Well, here goes nothing.</p>
<p>Mum, Dad... meet Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>How do you do?</p>
<p>Hey. How are you?</p>
<p>Nice to meet you.</p>
<p>You know what's great about you English?</p>
<p>Octopussy. Man, I must have seen that movie... twice.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes. That's not too bad.</p>
<p>Hey, Krabappel, get in the way of that bouquet... I'll stuff that sunhat down your neck.</p>
<p>Smithers, take me home. I'm not fully defrosted.</p>
<p>Nonsense. Just sit down and rest for a moment.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Oh, no. We've got a little situation here.</p>
<p>I can't feel anything below my cummerbund.</p>
<p>Hi, Dad.</p>
<p>You look great, sweetheart.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Little Lisa. Lisa Simpson.</p>
<p>I always felt you were the best thing my name ever got attached to.</p>
<p>Since you learned to pin your own diapers, you've been smarter than me.</p>
<p>Oh, Dad.</p>
<p>No, no. Let me finish.</p>
<p>I want you to know I've always been proud of you.</p>
<p>You're my greatest accomplishment, and you did it all yourself.</p>
<p>You helped me understand my own wife better... and taught me to be a better person. But you're also my daughter.</p>
<p>I don't think anybody could've had a better daughter...</p>
<p>Dad, you're babbling.</p>
<p>See? You're still helping me.</p>
<p>Hey, Dad, did you forget to give those cuff links to Hugh?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Well?</p>
<p>I found them on the nightstand.</p>
<p>I guess they weren't his cup of tea. Don't worry.</p>
<p>But you've been going on about these all week.</p>
<p>I'm sure he just forgot.</p>
<p>Lisa, we're not supposed to see each other before the wedding.</p>
<p>It's tradition.</p>
<p>What about my family's tradition?</p>
<p>Surely you don't want me to wear those in front of my parents and their friends.</p>
<p>But you promised my dad you would.</p>
<p>I was just humoring him.</p>
<p>Actually, he frightens me a bit.</p>
<p>I know they look silly... but his feelings will be hurt.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>I must say, you were right. This has been quite trying.</p>
<p>I've attempted to enjoy your family on a personal level... on an ironic level, as a novelty, as camp, as kitsch... as cautionary example. Nothing works.</p>
<p>When we get back to England, we won't have to deal with them.</p>
<p>You saying we won't see my family again?</p>
<p>Your mother will come when the children are born.</p>
<p>I can't believe I'm hearing this. I don't wanna cut my family out.</p>
<p>Really? Lisa, you're better than this place.</p>
<p>You're like a flower that grew out of dirt.</p>
<p>That's a horrible thing to say.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>You complain more than anyone.</p>
<p>Maybe, but I still love them.</p>
<p>And I don't think you understand that.</p>
<p>And now, to sing &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;... Miss Maggie Simpson.</p>
<p>She's quite a hellion, but does have an incredible voice.</p>
<p>Stop everything. The wedding has been called off.</p>
<p>This is very sad news.</p>
<p>It never would've happened if the wedding was in the church with God... instead of out here in the cheap showiness of nature.</p>
<p>Who wants cake?</p>
<p>The next day, Hugh goes back to England, and you never see him again.</p>
<p>Now that I know, isn't there any way to change the future?</p>
<p>No. But try to look surprised.</p>
<p>You said you'd tell me about my true love.</p>
<p>Oh, you'll have a true love.</p>
<p>But I specialize in foretelling the relationships... where you get jerked around.</p>
<p>Lisa, where were you? You missed the most incredible thing.</p>
<p>Hi, Dad.</p>
<p>I ate seven pounds of fudge.</p>
<p>The man at the stand said it was a record.</p>
<p>What else did you do, Dad?</p>
<p>I rode the tea cups. Then I got a little sick, and I had to sit down.</p>
<p>But then I rode them again.</p>
