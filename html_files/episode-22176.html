<p>(CAMERA MACHINERY WHIRRING)</p>
<p>Oh, boy! Casino night!</p>
<p>Finally, they'll teach our kids the dangers of doubling down on a six.</p>
<p>I really shouldn't be here. I have a problem with games of chance.</p>
<p>I played Candy Land with Maggie and ended up throwing vodka in her face.</p>
<p>Aw, Marge. I bet you've gotten that out of your system.</p>
<p>Bet? System? Betting system?</p>
<p>God is telling me to gamble!</p>
<p>(PEOPLE PROTESTING) Hey! Hey! Hey!</p>
<p>Deal. Hit me, hit me, hit me. Busted.</p>
<p>(WHIMPERS)</p>
<p>Welcome to Springfield Elementary Casino Night.</p>
<p>My fee for this evening goes to v*ctim of my criminal recidivism.</p>
<p>So relax, have fun and please God don't piss me off.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Mr. Student Body President.</p>
<p>Your Casino Night is a huge success.</p>
<p>Thanks, Principal Skinner.</p>
<p>I got the idea from an episode of Saved by the Bell.</p>
<p>It was always on too late for me.</p>
<p>I'll put everything on lucky 17.</p>
<p>(REPEATING) D'oh!</p>
<p>Woo-hoo! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh...</p>
<p>Woo-hoo! D'oh! D'oh...</p>
<p>Woo-hoo!</p>
<p>And the winner is 17!</p>
<p>I win!</p>
<p>This is it, baby. First thing tomorrow, we're getting a PlayStation One.</p>
<p>Ohhh!</p>
<p>I'd like to cash in these chips.</p>
<p>Give me most of it in cash and the rest in suitcases to carry the cash.</p>
<p>Sir, this casino is for charity.</p>
<p>These chips are only redeemable in cafeteria scrip or a day at the ballpark with Groundskeeper Willie.</p>
<p>I'll be bringin' sparkplugs to chuck at people I don't like, like you!</p>
<p>But I'm up $200,000.</p>
<p>Give me my money!</p>
<p>Think I won't manhandle a little boy?</p>
<p>You don't understand. It's not real money.</p>
<p>None of these people have won any money.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Didn't anyone read the flyer?</p>
<p>It was sent home last Tuesday.</p>
<p>(MILHOUSE SCREAMING)</p>
<p>Look at me! I'm a big man!</p>
<p>But I break just like a little girl.</p>
<p>Well, this was a disaster.</p>
<p>I should've known. The same thing happened on Saved by the Bell.</p>
<p>Care for a milk? No, thank you.</p>
<p>Martin, in light of this fiasco, you're going to have to resign as president.</p>
<p>I'll have that milk now.</p>
<p>Easy there. That's whole milk.</p>
<p>I'm a private citizen now! I can drink what I like!</p>
<p>You won't have Martin Prince to kick around anymore!</p>
<p>(SOLEMN MUSIC PLAYING)</p>
<p>Well, I guess we're gonna need a new student body president.</p>
<p>We're from Acme Amusement Rental.</p>
<p>We're looking for Principal Skinner.</p>
<p>Uh. Yes, we all are. Whoo!</p>
<p>(HUMMING)</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Hey, student body president!</p>
<p>Ah! I can join past presidents like Otto, or Krusty...</p>
<p>Nelson, you're running for president?</p>
<p>I'm not saying I have all the answers, but I do have all the answer keys to every test.</p>
<p>(ALL CHEERING)</p>
<p>Fractions, dinosaurs, foreign money, the first Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Nelson, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Real estate license exam.</p>
<p>My ticket to freedom!</p>
<p>(CHANTING) Nelson! Nelson!</p>
<p>I'm doomed.</p>
<p>(SIGHING) I can't b*at Nelson.</p>
<p>Why don't you start a rumor that he's ding-a-ling-a-ling, hello!</p>
<p>(GIGGLING EFFEMINATELY)</p>
<p>What a delicious quiche! I drive a pink Miata!</p>
<p>I can't believe Nelson is more popular than me.</p>
<p>(VOCALIZING EFFEMINATELY)</p>
<p>Honey, you could be popular. You've just gotta be yourself in a whole new way!</p>
<p>No. I'm gonna stick to my platform of incremental policy amelioration.</p>
<p>Fluoridated water fountains, vegan lunch options.</p>
<p>(LISPING) My name is Nelson. I use a salad fork.</p>
<p>La-dee-dah! I wash my face!</p>
<p>Where did you get that tutu?</p>
<p>Clothesline.</p>
<p>(GIGGLING)</p>
<p>And we deserve a French teacher who actually speaks French!</p>
<p>(SPEAKING FRENCH)</p>
<p>What is she yakkin' about?</p>
<p>I rest my case.</p>
<p>(SCATTERED COUGH)</p>
<p>Nelson, rebuttal?</p>
<p>Yo, everyone, it's me, Nelson!</p>
<p>(ALL CHEERING)</p>
<p>(CHANTING) Nelson! Nelson! Nelson! Nelson!</p>
<p>(SINGING) I'm not that cool I don't wear jeans.</p>
<p>I've polished an apple or two.</p>
<p>But every grade that I grubbed I grubbed it for you.</p>
<p>So call me Bookworm.</p>
<p>But I'll never squirm when there's work to be done.</p>
<p>Yes, I'll take my lunch at my desk.</p>
<p>While you're all outside having fun.</p>
<p>Don't vote for me kids of Springfield.</p>
<p>Unless you want an effective leader.</p>
<p>I'll talk to teachers I'll handle Skinner.</p>
<p>A vote for Lisa makes you the winner.</p>
<p>Vote Lisa! Vote Lisa! Vote Lisa!</p>
<p>Hey, I've got a song, too.</p>
<p>(SINGING) I am lron Man!</p>
<p>(PLAYING AIR GUITAR)</p>
<p>Vote for me!</p>
<p>Ah, screw it.</p>
<p>Lisa. Lisa. Lisa.</p>
<p>Wow, she even b*at perennial write-in candidate &quot;Skinner Sucks.&quot;</p>
<p>Skinner! I'm worried.</p>
<p>This girl is extremely popular and thinks for herself.</p>
<p>She's like a female Eleanor Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Yeah. The students will do anything she says.</p>
<p>She's captured their imagination like a bright piece of construction paper.</p>
<p>Yes. Well, we've got to find a way to control her.</p>
<p>Hey, maybe that escaped mental patient you've hired has some sort of toxin in his shack.</p>
<p>Yes. Hello, Willie.</p>
<p>Well, if you ask me, a woman's weakness is her sense of vanity.</p>
<p>Vanity? You might have something there, Edna.</p>
<p>So when's my inauguration?</p>
<p>Hmm. Let's see. When hell freezes over, tough guy.</p>
<p>You wanted to see me?</p>
<p>Actually, Lisa, I wanted you to see you.</p>
<p>You're our president now.</p>
<p>But you look like the First Lady of Yawn.</p>
<p>What would you change?</p>
<p>(SINGING) Eyes, pearls, smile hair points, dress, voice shoes, Swatch watch.</p>
<p>I may be the new girl But you can't brainwash me.</p>
<p>Just OshKosh B'Gosh me And then leave me be.</p>
<p>To fight for kid power I must be heard not seen.</p>
<p>I have to lead wisely Not just primp and preen.</p>
<p>Nails, dimples ears, scrunchie.</p>
<p>Purse, lunchbox teeth, Milhouse.</p>
<p>This outing up suits me.</p>
<p>There's beauty within me.</p>
<p>So let's Olsen twin me.</p>
<p>Give them someone to love.</p>
<p>This grownup makeover.</p>
<p>Has made me a super tween.</p>
<p>For they are my people and I am their queen.</p>
<p>Oh, Lisa. You look so successful.</p>
<p>Like you're the wife of a businessman.</p>
<p>I wish I'd married a businessman.</p>
<p>Then I'd have nice things.</p>
<p>Well, it's a little over the top.</p>
<p>But there's no reason I can't look good and take back the playground from the gypsies.</p>
<p>(PLAYING FOLK TUNE)</p>
<p>Is our Frisbee now.</p>
<p>Hey, Lisa! Can I get a photo for the front page?</p>
<p>It'll either be a picture of you or the drinking fountain that won't stop running.</p>
<p>Make it snappy, Milhouse.</p>
<p>I've got an important meeting in the Teachers' Lounge.</p>
<p>The Teachers' Lounge. Is it true they make fun of students in there?</p>
<p>Oh, don't be silly.</p>
<p>(Willie) Look at me. I'm Milhouse.</p>
<p>I tuck my shirt into me underpants.</p>
<p>(ALL LAUGHING)</p>
<p>(Willie) I've got no friends. So I confide in Willie.</p>
<p>(LAUGHING LOUDLY)</p>
<p>(GIGGLING NERVOUSLY)</p>
<p>Oh, that's good...</p>

<p><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div></p>
<p>Oh, hello, Lisa. We were just discussing Vasco da Gama.</p>
<p>Well, I have some ideas for ways we can improve the classroom experience.</p>
<p>We need to get teachers more involved.</p>
<p>Have them meet with struggling kids in the morning before school.</p>
<p>Fine. I'll come in early to meet with students.</p>
<p>And I'll have hypnotherapy when?</p>
<p>Or we could hand out teachers' home phone numbers so kids can call them whenever they have questions.</p>
<p>I've got a question. You're crazy.</p>
<p>Look, in the Swedish public schools, the students grade the teachers on their performance.</p>
<p>Outstanding notions. Each more implementable than the last.</p>
<p>It's a shame you can't stay to discuss them. Here's your schedule for the day.</p>
<p>&quot;Photo op helping kindergartners take off snow boots.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Move the brush fire hazard needle&quot;?</p>
<p>Shouldn't I stay here and work on school policy?</p>
<p>Lisa, you were elected to be seen and enjoyed.</p>
<p>Don't hide your light in a smoky back room making dusty old decisions.</p>
<p>(GIGGLING)</p>
<p>Well, I am proud of my light.</p>
<p>But just in case you want to do any more thinking, I'm proud to present you with an official key to the study hall.</p>
<p>(GASPING) Use it anytime you like.</p>
<p>You mean I can come to the school after hours?</p>
<p>Weekends? Even during the summer?</p>
<p>Yes. It's like you're Harry Potter without the magic and wonder.</p>
<p>Just sign these authorization forms and you can be on your way.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>That little girl should learn to read things before she signs them.</p>
<p>Excuse me. I was wondering if I should read what I just signed.</p>
<p>No. Just standard key release boilerplate.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Boy, she'll believe anything.</p>
<p>&quot;Key release boilerplate&quot;? I find that very hard to believe.</p>
<p>Mmm-hmm. And yet there it is.</p>
<p>I'll just lock this door.</p>
<p>Boy, this key opens everything.</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>And then as school president, I don't have to take the hearing test.</p>
<p>I'm so proud of you, Lisa.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You're like Geraldine Ferraro. Except you won where she failed miserably.</p>
<p>Well, I think I can say with all humility, I am gonna be the best school president ever!</p>
<p>(SLOW APPLAUSE)</p>
<p>(SARCASTICALLY) Bravo, Lisa. Bravo.</p>
<p>Oh, isn't that sweet? Even your brother's adding his kudos.</p>
<p>I was being sarcastic.</p>
<p>You were?</p>
<p>(SARCASTICALLY) No, I was being sincere.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm so confused.</p>
<p>Lise, Skinner is using you like a pawn on his unholy chess set.</p>
<p>On my chess set, the pawns are all Hamburglars.</p>
<p>(b*at MUSIC PLAYING)</p>
<p>(SINGING) I'm so happy with my evil plan.</p>
<p>Say goodbye to music gym and art.</p>
<p>Soon we will have the perfect school.</p>
<p>Where fun and excitement never start.</p>
<p>I'm so drunk I can barely see.</p>
<p>But it helps me get through another day.</p>
<p>My stomach is filled with haggis and hurt.</p>
<p>I've got to go puke in some hay.</p>
<p>Lisa is a fool.</p>
<p>I think the rules are cool.</p>
<p>I've fallen in the pool (Seymour) Mmm!</p>
<p>Not a cloud in the sky.</p>
<p>A perfect day to unveil Operation S. L.A.A.A.M.</p>
<p>So Long Athletics, Art, and Music. Care for a t-shirt?</p>
<p>T-shirt?</p>
<p>Why don't you just give me a sandwich board that says &quot;male prostitute&quot;?</p>
<p>(EMBARRASSED LAUGH)</p>
<p>Forgive me, sir.</p>
<p>(GASPING)</p>
<p>They've taken everything. Oh, no.</p>
<p>(WEEPING)</p>
<p>Look what they've done to my triangle.</p>
<p>(PANTING) I'm doing it! I'm almost to the top!</p>
<p>Hello, self-esteem!</p>
<p>Repo man!</p>
<p>Ahhh! Ow!</p>
<p>(LAUGHS)</p>
<p>I love this job.</p>
<p>&quot;All extra-curricular activities are hereby canceled,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;to be replaced by nothing!&quot;</p>
<p>(ALL GASPING)</p>
<p>Who would sign such an order?</p>
<p>&quot;As ordered by Principal Skinner&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;and approved by Student Body President Lisa Simpson!&quot;</p>
<p>(ALL GASPING)</p>
<p>And to think I was gonna ask you to the dance!</p>
<p>I would've gone with you.</p>
<p>Well, you still can!</p>
<p>Well, I don't feel like it now.</p>
<p>Oh! That's cool. Stupid, stupid, stupid.</p>
<p>(RUMBLING)</p>
<p>Look, they're taking away the art room!</p>
<p>I'll be cooking my Lean Cuisine in your kiln tonight!</p>
<p>(LAUGHING EVILLY)</p>
<p>(SINGING) What have I done?</p>
<p>What they wanted you to.</p>
<p>Skinner betrayed me.</p>
<p>But a tango takes two.</p>
<p>I almost had a date.</p>
<p>I've gotta tell Willie about this.</p>
<p>(IN A SING-SONG VOICE) Lisa is a sellout. Lisa is a sellout.</p>
<p>Lisa, what's a sellout?</p>
<p>With the band gone, how will I know who to b*at up?</p>
<p>They eliminated English for Fat Kids!</p>
<p>Okay, you'll do!</p>
<p>Lise, you made this school even worse.</p>
<p>And it wasn't exactly San Diego State to begin with.</p>
<p>They made me pretty and popular just so they could exploit me and ruin my good name.</p>
<p>Lisa, you've got to stand up to these guys.</p>
<p>And when you do, people will remember you.</p>
<p>Just look at these postage stamps.</p>
<p>There's Bugs Bunny, Fat Elvis, Autumn in New England, Bats of the Southwest, all heroes.</p>
<p>Do you want to see Elvis kiss a bat?</p>
<p>(MIMICKING ELVIS PRESLEY) Hey, baby, come here. I want to kiss you.</p>
<p>(KISSING) Squeak, squeak!</p>
<p>No, don't kiss me.</p>
<p>You tricked me into betraying my fellow students!</p>
<p>Lisa, student government is meaningless.</p>
<p>Look at your constitution. It's written on the back of a place mat.</p>
<p>And not a good place mat. It's from someplace called &quot;Doodles.&quot;</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Principal Skinner, may I make an announcement to the school?</p>
<p>I can't see the harm.</p>
<p>I hereby resign as your president.</p>
<p>And for my last act I call a general student strike effective immediately!</p>
<p>Gimme that!</p>
<p>Any student caught striking will be severely disciplined unless all of you do it.</p>
<p>Then I'm stymied.</p>
<p>(CHANTING) Strike! Strike! Strike!</p>
<p>Lisa, please help me lure them back. I had to do what I did.</p>
<p>Our budget is stretched tighter than Mother's sauna pants.</p>
<p>Seymour! Quit using me in analogies.</p>
<p>Yes, Mother.</p>
<p>Principal Skinner, I will not call off this strike until you bring back music and art!</p>
<p>What about gym? Meh.</p>
<p>(CHANTING) Hey, hey, Seymour S. Nurture our well-roundedness!</p>
<p>Sneeze, puke, burp, fart, we want music, gym, and art!</p>
<p>Why didn't I cancel Sign Making and Creative Chanting?</p>
<p>Principal Skinner, can't you just reinstate those programs?</p>
<p>Would you be willing to pay an extra $1 .23 in taxes to fund them?</p>
<p>No way! I'm saving for a speedboat.</p>
<p>(CHANTING) Strike! Strike!</p>
<p>Lisa, what are you doing?</p>
<p>This is the kind of trouble-making I expect from your brother.</p>
<p>You do? Cool. A blank check for mayhem.</p>
<p>Mom, I was elected to make this a better school.</p>
<p>Well, couldn't you just hang some colorful crepe paper in the gym?</p>
<p>They've taken away our crepe paper.</p>
<p>Those Fudruckers!</p>
<p>(SIRENS WAIL)</p>
<p>Oh, no. They heard me.</p>
<p>Remember, boys. These are little kids.</p>
<p>So take out your tiny batons.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>Chief Wiggum, we're just like you policemen.</p>
<p>Don't you ever feel like the mayor doesn't care about you?</p>
<p>You mean, the mayor who kept me waiting for two hours in that restaurant?</p>
<p>I ate so much bread...</p>
<p>(SOBS SOFTLY)</p>
<p>Sit down, boys! We're joining this strike!</p>
<p>Chief, are you sure the mayor wasn't at a different Olive Garden than you?</p>
<p>Well, I can't take that rattlesnake out of his mailbox now, now can I?</p>
<p>Yes, Chief, you could.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you this. Shut up.</p>
<p>The Springfield student strike has entered its fourth day with no end in sight.</p>
<p>Today professional buttinski Michael Moore arrived on the scene.</p>
<p>Kids who don't get to take music and art are 10% more likely to become chronically unemployed and appear in one of my movies.</p>
<p>Where did you get that statistic? Your mother!</p>
<p>The student strikers have been joined by other unions including the Springfield Goat Milkers, the Association of News Room Cue Card Holders...</p>
<p>Ow.</p>
<p>And the United Federation of Theme Park Zombies.</p>
<p>Zombie eat brains but zombie cannot swallow this injustice.</p>
<p>At the heart of the strike is former student body president, Lisa Simpson.</p>
<p>Her brother had this to say.</p>
<p>Lisa is a nut. She has a rubber butt.</p>
<p>Every time she turns around, it goes putt putt.</p>
<p>Indeed. But that rubber butt doesn't have much time for turning around these days.</p>
<p>It's pointed squarely in the face of the administration.</p>
<p>Skinner! We have got to get these kids back in school!</p>
<p>Willie, can't you turn your hose on them?</p>
<p>They are wee children. I'd sooner turn it on myself.</p>
<p>Well, that's a good idea, too.</p>
<p>Now see here, you nose-wiping hair-combers!</p>
<p>Back in Edinburgh, we had a coal miner's strike.</p>
<p>All we wanted were hats with a wee light on top.</p>
<p>Then one day the mine collapsed.</p>
<p>No one made it out alive. Not even Willie!</p>
<p>Skinner! I don't mean to interrupt your advice from the janitor, but I say cut off the head and the body will die.</p>
<p>You want to get rid of Lisa? But she's such a good student.</p>
<p>Yes. In fact, I think she's a little too good for this school.</p>
<p>If we stand together, we are strong!</p>
<p>(ALL CHEERING)</p>
<p>Lisa Simpson, you have just been transferred to the Springfield Magnet School for the Gifted and Troublesome.</p>
<p>Please climb into the idling bus.</p>
<p>But, but I...</p>
<p>(SINGING) Poor Lisa Poor Lisa.</p>
<p>Don't cry for me kids of Springfield.</p>
<p>You can still reach me through e-mail at Smart Girl 63 underscore back slash at Yahoo dot com, at Yahoo dot com (SPEAKING FRENCH)</p>
<p>Oh, this place is paradise!</p>
<p>Well, I guess this story has a happy ending after all.</p>
<p>Just like my last massage.</p>
<p>I'm not driving 45 minutes a day!</p>
<p>You can't go to that school!</p>
<p>But this is my dream.</p>
<p>Oh, why can't you have a normal dream like being an Olympic figure skater?</p>
<p>Okay. Let me take figure skating.</p>
<p>Are you crazy? I'm not getting up at 6:30 every morning so you can prance around a frozen pond and think you're better than me.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: Well, what can I be?</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: I don't know. How about a horse whisperer?</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: Okay!</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Over my dead body!</p>
