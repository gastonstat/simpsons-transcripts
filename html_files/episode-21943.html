<p>McBain: Ya, thank you, ya. That's nice. Let's say hello to my music guy, Zoe.(Crowd applauds, Zoe bows to McBain.) That is some outfit Zoe, it makes you look like a homosexual.(Crowd boos, McBain is startled, he nervously speaks and points to crowd.) Uh, oh...maybe you are all homosexuals too.(Crowd boos louder.)</p>
<p>*Transition to Bart and Lisa watching the TV*</p>
<p>Bart:(Annoyed) This is horrible.</p>
<p>Lisa: The Fox network has sunk to a new low.</p>
<p>(Marge enters with the mail.)</p>
<p>Marge: Lisa you got a letter.</p>
<p>Lisa:(excited) It's from my pen pal Anya! (Lisa reads letter, Anya's voice can be heard: &quot;Dear Lisa, As I write this I am very sad. Our president has been overthrown and(turns into man's voice) replaced by the benevolent General Thrull. All hail Thrull and his glorious new regime! Sincerly, Little Girl.&quot; Lisa moans.)</p>

<p>(TV exclaims, &quot;The Itchy and Scratchy Show!&quot; Episode title: Spay Anything.)</p>
<p>(Scratchy walks towards Itchy's Cat Hospital. Scratchy sees sign out front that says, &quot;We pay your pet $75.&quot; Scratchy bolts right in. 2 bulldog orderlies grab scratchy and put him on a table. Itchy waves at Scratchy and turns on laser. .(Think of in the Bond movie with the ray g*n.) Scratchy screams. Scratchy extends his tongue and unplugs the power cord. Scratchy breathes a sigh of relief. Itchy runs back in and plugs laser back in and the laser proceeds to cut Scratchy into many pieces.)</p>
<p>(Lisa laughs but Bart does not, he still looks worried. Lisa notices this.)</p>
<p>Lisa:(Worried) Bart what's wrong?</p>

<p>Bart: But who would want to hurt me? I'm this century's Dennis the Menace.</p>
<p>Homer: It's probably the person you least suspect.</p>
<p>Lisa:(sarcasticly laughs)That's good dad.</p>
<p>Grandpa: I say we call Matlock. He'll find the culprit. Its probably that evil Gabbon McCloud or George Gueber Lindsey.</p>
<p>Bart: Grandpa, Matlocks not real.</p>
<p>Grandpa: Neither are my teeth but I can still eat corn on the cob if someone cuts it off and smushes it off into a fine paste. Now that's good eating!</p>
<p>*Transition to school yard.*</p>
<p>(Bart looks paranoid, Milhouse walks over to him.)</p>
<p>Milhouse: I checked around, the girls are calling you &quot;fatty fat fat fat&quot; and Nelson is planing on pulling down your pants, but no one is trying to k*ll ya.</p>
<p>Bart: Ah, that's a relief.(Nelson pulls down Bart's pants from behing. The girls chime in with a chorus of &quot;Fatty fat fat fat.&quot;)</p>
<p>*Transition to Bart's room. Radio alarm goes off*</p>
<p>Radio Announcer: Alright, this is dedicated to Bart Simpson with the message, I am coming to k*ll you, slowly and painfully.(Radio plays &quot;Wipeout.&quot; Bart pulls covers over face. He goes downstairs where Marge is cutting something.)</p>
<p>Marge:(Pointing scissors at bart.) Bart I'm going to get you!!...(Bart gasps).....some ice cream at the store since I'm saving so much money on diet cola.(She holds up a coupon. Bart dashes outside. As he is walking outside Ned Flanders jumps out in front of him wearing a hand razor glove. Bart gasps.)</p>

<p>*Transition to Police station* (Marge is talking with Chief Wiggum.)</p>
<p>Wiggum: I'd like to help you m'am, but, heh heh, I'm afraid there's no law against mailing threatning letters.</p>
<p>Marge: I'm pretty sure there is.</p>
<p>Wiggum: Hah! The day I take cop lessons from Ma Kettle.</p>
<p>Lou:(comes over with rule book.)Hey, she's right chief.</p>
<p>Wiggum: Well shut my mouth! It's also illegal to put squirrels down your pants for the puposes of gambling.(Pans to officers doing just that.)Boys, knock it off!</p>
<p>*Transition to Bart's room* (Lisa rushes in)</p>
<p>Lisa: Bart I've figured it out! Who's someone you've been making irritating phone calls to these years.</p>
<p>Bart: Linda Lavin?</p>
<p>Lisa: No, someone who didn't deserve it. (They go down to kitchen. Lisa dials Moe's.)</p>
<p>Lisa: Hello, Moe. We know your the one behind it so knock it off or we're going to the cops!</p>
<p>Moe:(At Moe's) No, no, I'll take care of it.(Moe bursts into backroom.) Ok it's over, get them out of here!(Moe brakes open a crate, a Panda is inside. Pandas run out of Moe's with Moe shouting, &quot;Alright, undele! undele!)</p>
<p>*Transition to Bart's room window*</p>
<p>Bart: You're out there somewhere, but where? Where!?!(Screen pans towards Springfield State Prison, we go inside a cell window which belongs to the infamous Sideshow Bob. He is writing another death threat to Bart in his own bl*od. He laughs when he is done. Then he starts to write something new.)</p>
<p>Bob: Dear &quot;Life in these United States&quot;...a funny thing happened to me...(Bob collapses.)</p>

<p>Snake: Guh?</p>
<p>Bob: Take care.</p>
<p>Snake: Buh. (Parole board meeting for bob starts. Chief Wiggum testifies.)</p>
<p>Wiggum: Sideshow bob has no decency. He called me Chief &quot;Piggum.&quot; (Courtroom laughs. Wiggum laughs.) Now I get it. (Laughs again) That's good. (Selma testifies)</p>
<p>Selma: Sideshow Bob tried to k*ll me on our honeymoon. (courtroom whispers amoungst themselves.)</p>
<p>Lawyer: How many people in this court are thinking of k*ll her right now? (3 peoples hands go up.)Be honest! (Everyone raises their hands including Patty. The man next to Patty looks at her.)</p>
<p>Patty: Well, she's always leaving the toilet seat up. (Bob goes up to testify.)</p>
<p>Lawyer: Robert, if released would you pose a threat to one Bart Simpson?</p>
<p>Bob: Bart Simpson? Ha! The spirited, little scamp who twice foiled my evil schemes and sent me to this dank, urine soaked hell hole.</p>
<p>Left board member: Uhh, we object to the term, &quot;urine-soaked hell hole&quot; when you could of said, &quot;pee-pee-soaked heck hole.&quot;</p>
<p>Bob: Cheerfully withdrawn.</p>
<p>Lawyer: What about that tattoo on your chest, doesn't it say &quot;DIE BART DIE&quot;?</p>

<p>*Transition to what looks like normal Simpson's opening only it is replaced with &quot;The Thompsons&quot; and it zooms in on Terror Lake.*</p>
<p>Homer: Wow! A houseboat, you know the great thing is if you don't like your neighbors you can just pull up the anchor and sail someplace else. (Simpsons, er, Thompsons laugh, other houseboats quickly sail away. Thompsons go into houseboat, Bob rolls out from under the car battered and bruised. He gets up and he steps on a rake and it hits him in the face. He turns another direction and is hit in the face by another rake. Continues to happen over and over and over again.</p>

<p>Bob: Hello Bart.</p>
<p>Bart: Ahhhh! (Looks over and sees an old lady.)</p>
<p>Bob: Down here Bart. (Bart looks down and Bob is underneath the car. He unstraps himself but is hit in the head by the car's bumper as it pulls away.)</p>
<p>Bart: What do you want!?</p>
<p>Bob: Surely theres no harm in laying in the middle of a public street. (Just then a marching band appears and marches on Bob, they are then followed by numerous elephants who each trample Bob.)</p>
<p>*Transition to houseboat. Homer is busy drinking a duff. Bart rushes in.*</p>
<p>Bart: Mom! Dad! I saw Sideshow Bob and he threatned to k*ll me!</p>
<p>Homer: Bart! Don't interrupt!</p>
<p>Marge: Homer this is serious!</p>

<p>Homer: C'mon, let me cut you a brownie while there still hot.</p>
<p>Bart: &lt;sigh of relief&gt; Dad, I'm kinda edgy right now. I'd appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a buthcer's kn*fe.</p>
<p>Homer: Why? Oh, haha, the Sideshow Bob thing. I'm sorry boy.(He leaves. Bart settles down again. Homer then burst through the door wearing a hockey mask and wielding a chainsaw.)</p>
<p>Homer: BART!! YOU WANNA SEE MY NEW CHAINSAW AND HOCKEY MASK!!!! (Bart screams and looks like he is going to die from fear.) Oh, sorry, What am I thinking?</p>
<p>*Transition to outside houseboat. Bob climbs up onto the deck. He walks foward and is once again hit in the face by another rake. He throws it aside. He cuts the rope keeping the boat at the docks and the boat begins to drift.)</p>
<p>*Transiton to Bart's cabin. The door is opened, Bart wakes.*</p>
<p>Bob: Hello, Bart! (Approaches Bart)</p>
<p>Bart: Mom! Dad!</p>
<p>Bob: Your family can't help you now.</p>
<p>*Transition showing rest of family tied up. Homer is knocked out cold.*</p>
<p>Homer: &lt;snore&gt;</p>
<p>Lisa: Oh no! Dads been drugged!</p>
<p>Marge:(annoyed) No he hasn't!</p>
<p>*Transition back to Bart's cabin.*</p>
<p>(Bart escapes through the window just as Bob's short sword (kind of.) almost hits him. Bart runs to the front of the boat to escape but is greeted by a hungry alligator.)</p>
<p>Bart: Uh oh! (He runs to the back to escape bt there are electric eels there.) ewwoooh!(He runs back to the front just to see the gator again.) Oh yeah...(Bart is trapped.)</p>
<p>Bob: Well Bart, any last requests? (Walks toward Bart.)</p>
<p>Bart: Well,...there is one, but(Looks at distance to Springfield sign.)...Nah...</p>
<p>Bob: No, go on.</p>
<p>Bart:You have such a beautiful voice.</p>
<p>Bob: Guilty as charged.</p>
<p>Bart: Uh huh. Anyway, I was wondering if you could sing the entire score of the HMS Pinnafore.</p>
<p>Bob: Very well Bart. I shall send you to heaven before I send you to hell. (Grabs Bart and seats him. Bob sings the entire score to the HMS Pinnafore, which takes awhile of course. When he finishes he receives flowers and Bart gives him a standing ovation. Bob draws his sword (Which has now transformed into a saber.0_o)</p>
<p>Bob: And now for the final curtain. (Just as Bob is about to strike the boat hits the shore and Bob losses his balance and falls against the railing. g*n cocking sounds are heard, the Springfield police are there.)</p>
<p>Wiggum: Hold it right there Sideshow Bob. You're under arrest.</p>
<p>Bob: By Lucifer's beard!</p>
<p>Wiggum: Uh yeah, it's a good thing you drifted by this brothel.</p>
<p>*Transition to later that day.*</p>
<p>Bart: I knew I had to buy some time so I asked him to sing the score from the HMS Pinnafore.</p>
<p>Homer: Oooh, a fiendishly clever intricacy. (In other words he said it was a great plan.)</p>
<p>Bart: (Looks over at cops.) Take him away boys.</p>
<p>Wiggum: Hey, I'm the chief here. Bake him away toys.</p>
<p>Lou: What you say chief?</p>
<p>Wiggum: Do what the kid said.</p>
<p>*Transition to outside the old Simpson home*</p>
<p>Marge: It's so good to be home again. (Grandpa or should I say &quot;Grandma&quot; runs up to the car.)</p>
<p>Grandpa: Look what happened without my pills!!</p>
<p>Marge: Huh!?! Bart run upstairs and get Grandpa's medicine! (Jasper walks over to Grandpa.)</p>
<p>Jasper: Not so fast. I want to court this fair young lady.(Grandpa blushes)</p>
<p>Grandpa: There's something you should know about me.</p>
<p>Jasper: I've got (Sounds like, &quot;steel lady tickets.&quot;)</p>
<p>Grandpa: I'm all yours! (Kisses Jasper.)</p>
<p>Fade to black.</p>
