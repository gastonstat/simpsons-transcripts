<p> - Everyone </p>
<p> - [ALL SINGING]</p>
<p> - ANNOUNCER: was napping.</p>
<p> - - Ahmed Adoody.</p>
<p> - MARGE: Wait, there's - My people.</p>
<p> - come down to the Stu </p>
<p> [GRUNTS]</p>
<p> Steamed ham.</p>
<p> The cosmic ballet goes on.</p>
<p> - Gigantism.</p>
<p> - King of the world!</p>
<p> Oh, this is the best gift of all, Homer.</p>
<p> - It is?</p>
<p> - What's his name?</p>
<p> Number Eight.</p>
<p> Uh, I mean, Santa's Little Helper.</p>
<p> Why does Homer talk like Walter Matthau?</p>
<p> [CELLO PLAYING]</p>
<p> Hey, Martin Princess.</p>
<p> If you like that cello so much, why don't you marry it?</p>
<p> - No heckling.</p>
<p> - Way to quash 'em, sir.</p>
<p> Hey, Skinner, if you like Chalmers so much, why don't you marry him?</p>
<p> Well, as the superintendent, he's married to all the principals.</p>
<p> Thank you.</p>
<p> You've made the anniversary of my wife's death even more depressing.</p>
<p> Who likes happy songs?</p>
<p> [CHEERING]</p>
<p> Well, for those of you who didn't cheer, here's a very sad song about the world today.</p>
<p> She loves me.</p>
<p> She loves me not.</p>
<p> Oh, why do I always use flowers with two petals?</p>
<p> [MELANCHOLY SAXOPHONE MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
<p> Simpson, pull the fire alarm.</p>
<p> You want me to embarrass my sister in front of the whole school?</p>
<p> No.</p>
<p> I dared you.</p>
<p> Don't do it, Bart.</p>
<p> Please.</p>
<p> I love you.</p>
<p> I'm not doing it.</p>
<p> I'm refusing a dare.</p>
<p> You just signed your death warrant, Simpson.</p>
<p> And we're the witnesses.</p>
<p> All we need is a notary.</p>
<p> - ALL [CHANTING]: Notary.</p>
<p> Notary.</p>
<p> - We'll see.</p>
<p> Oh, it's that kid who refused a dare.</p>
<p> His life is ruined.</p>
<p> I'm turning my back on you.</p>
<p> Hi, Bart.</p>
<p> Simpson, I'd like to see you in my office.</p>
<p> Your parents are waiting.</p>
<p> KIDS: Whoa.</p>
<p> [SINGSONGY]: Bart's got a dad.</p>
<p> Bart's got a dad.</p>
<p> I do not.</p>
<p> Bart, I just want to say I'm so proud of you.</p>
<p> Dad, do you think I did the right thing?</p>
<p> Of course, absolutely.</p>
<p> You did the worst thing any boy can do.</p>
<p> It's worse than wetting your pants while on Santa's lap, and I've been on both sides of that one.</p>
<p> I'm sorry.</p>
<p> Bart, you have to take a dare.</p>
<p> - B-B-But what if it's?</p>
<p> - Any dare.</p>
<p> GRAMPA, Dad says I have to take a dare.</p>
<p> I had Homer on a dare, and as horrible as that worked out, I'd do that again.</p>
<p> Why did someone dare you to have Homer?</p>
<p> It was after the w*r; we needed babies.</p>
<p> Bart, I have a secret.</p>
<p> I've never been happier to be your mother.</p>
<p> You're a good boy.</p>
<p> Mom, please.</p>
<p> Somebody might hear you.</p>
<p> [BOTH GRUNTING]</p>
<p> [KIDS LAUGHING]</p>
<p> Oh, look at him!</p>
<p> [SQUEALS]</p>
<p> Ha-ha.</p>
<p> Bart's mom wears a seat belt.</p>
<p> [LAUGHTER]</p>
<p> Let them laugh, Bart.</p>
<p> This is wonderful.</p>
<p> Every laugh turns into one more smoochie-poo from Mom.</p>
<p> [SMOOCHING]</p>
<p> Cut it out.</p>
<p> [BOAT HORN BLOWS]</p>
<p> Three cheers for the mama's boys.</p>
<p> Sorry to do this on Mother's Day!</p>
<p> [SPLASHING]</p>
<p> So, Simpson, word on the street is you're looking for a dare.</p>
<p> Yeah, fine.</p>
<p> I need to get this monkey off my back.</p>
<p> Hey, how about that for a dare?</p>
<p> Putting a monkey on his back.</p>
<p> And after we're done, then what?</p>
<p> We have a monkey that's our permanent responsibility.</p>
<p> Yeah, think ahead, dingus.</p>
<p> Simpson, I dare you to jump into the reservoir from Dead Boy's Ledge.</p>
<p> We'll be watching from Haw-Haw Heights.</p>
<p> Simpson, is that your kid?</p>
<p> Oh, my God.</p>
<p> I've got to stop him!</p>
<p> I dare you not to.</p>
<p> Oh, uh, oh.</p>
<p> It was a joke, idiot.</p>
<p> Get your kid.</p>
<p> [LAUGHS]</p>
<p> [SHRIEKS]</p>
<p> Bart!</p>
<p> Do I really have to do this?</p>
<p> JIMBO: I dare you.</p>
<p> [ECHOING]: Dare you.</p>
<p> Dare you.</p>
<p> Dare you.</p>
<p> I love Echo Canyon.</p>
<p> Oh, this place sure has a lot of names.</p>
<p> Cowabunga!</p>
<p> [SCREAMS]</p>
<p> We've done all we could.</p>
<p> Run!</p>
<p> b*at it!</p>
<p> - [BEEPING]</p>
<p> - He'll be fine.</p>
<p> - [CHIMES]</p>
<p> - And my burrito's ready.</p>
<p> Mmm.</p>
<p> Your boy should wake up soon.</p>
<p> Mmm.</p>
<p> All right.</p>
<p> This time, he's really done it.</p>
<p> We're gonna have to do something.</p>
<p> Change schools.</p>
<p> Move.</p>
<p> Whatever it takes.</p>
<p> Mom?</p>
<p> - Sweetie, are you okay?</p>
<p> - I am.</p>
<p> Then why would you do such a stupid, stupid thing?</p>
<p> Marge, Marge.</p>
<p> As someone who's fallen off a cliff multiple times, the best thing we can do is teach him how to fall off cliffs.</p>
<p> I just want to know, Bart.</p>
<p> I had hope and now I don't.</p>
<p> Why?</p>
<p> Please, O Lord.</p>
<p> Let him think of an awesome lie.</p>
<p> Well, when I was in the other world What other world?</p>
<p> Hmm, hmm I'm not sure.</p>
<p> But it was joyful, clouds, harps, Abe Lincoln.</p>
<p> Oh, my God, Marge!</p>
<p> I think our son went to heaven.</p>
<p> Were there any other presidents?</p>
<p> - No.</p>
<p> - It was heaven.</p>
<p> What else, boy?</p>
<p> I have a message for you, Mom.</p>
<p> - From who?</p>
<p> - Jesus.</p>
<p> Don't say that if it's not true.</p>
<p> You have to believe him, Marge.</p>
<p> It's a deathbed confession.</p>
<p> He's not on his deathbed.</p>
<p> The guy in the bed before him died.</p>
<p> Mom.</p>
<p> Jesus said to tell you, &quot;Things will get better. &quot; </p>
<p> Oh, I really want to believe that.</p>
<p> If you saw Jesus, did you see anything else?</p>
<p> I saw your dad, Grandpa Bouvier.</p>
<p> Tell me something he said that only I would know.</p>
<p> - He said - HOMER: Hmm?</p>
<p> he thinks Homer is an idiot.</p>
<p> [MARGE GASPS, HOMER GROANS]</p>
<p> Oh, my God, I can hear his voice through you.</p>
<p> [CRYING]: Excuse me a minute.</p>
<p> Good work, boy.</p>
<p> You got us off the hook in the short term, which is all that ever matters.</p>
<p> [GRUNTS]</p>
<p> - Tell me more about heaven, son.</p>
<p> - Jesus rides a rainbow horse.</p>
<p> Fascinating.</p>
<p> Is the horse rainbow-colored?</p>
<p> Or does it walk on a rainbow?</p>
<p> Uh rainbows come out its butt.</p>
<p> [GASPS]</p>
<p> Let me ponder that with joy.</p>
<p> Mmm.</p>
<p> Tell me more, son.</p>
<p> Well, there's no cracks on the sidewalks.</p>
<p> And saying you brushed your teeth makes it true.</p>
<p> You can go to baseball games with all the dead players.</p>
<p> And you always catch a home run.</p>
<p> And the angels talk to each other like this: </p>
<p> [TRILLS LIPS]</p>
<p> Does this, uh, Jesus have any tattoos or distinguishing marks?</p>
<p> No, but he really thinks the sermons are too long.</p>
<p> Boys, we're gonna have a talk with the Reverend.</p>
<p> LISA: Bart.</p>
<p> I've held my tongue, because I appreciate you not ruining my song.</p>
<p> Can't ruin what already sucks.</p>
<p> Burn.</p>
<p> [SIGHS]</p>
<p> All right.</p>
<p> I'm just gonna say it.</p>
<p> I don't think you really saw Jesus.</p>
<p> You know, the Lord warned me there'd be disbelievers.</p>
<p> Begone!</p>
<p> I don't know why you're doing this, but beware, little lies lead to big lies.</p>
<p> - And big lies get punished.</p>
<p> - [DOORBELL RINGS]</p>
<p> [GRAVELLY VOICE]: Ooh!</p>
<p> That's the Devil ringing that bell.</p>
<p> Are you gonna answer?</p>
<p> Hey, don't think you can scare the boy who died and went to heaven.</p>
<p> - [DOORBELL RINGS]</p>
<p> - [GRAVELLY VOICE]: Get the door.</p>
<p> Hey, cut it out.</p>
<p> [NORMAL VOICE]: Oh, no, it's stuck.</p>
<p> Hello, Bart.</p>
<p> We are Christian movie producers.</p>
<p> So you give all your profits back to the church?</p>
<p> Uh [COUGHS]</p>
<p> You uh Could you, uh, uh Could you get your dad?</p>
<p> Homer, we're the best in the business.</p>
<p> Our films average 98% on Rotten Communion Wafers.</p>
<p> Now, we'd like to tell your son's story.</p>
<p> You want to make a movie out of what happened to Bart?</p>
<p> Well, absolutely.</p>
<p> Unless it's not true.</p>
<p> HOMER: Okay, I could admit the boy totally lied or I could make a movie inspired by true events.</p>
<p> [GIGGLES]</p>
<p> Brother Homer, why do you hesitate?</p>
<p> I hesitate because I am stunned that you doubt the Word of God!</p>
<p> - [GASPING]</p>
<p> - Whoa.</p>
<p> Then we have a deal.</p>
<p> Not so fast.</p>
<p> Like most of America, I think I know the movie business.</p>
<p> Please.</p>
<p> What would you like?</p>
<p> I want input on the script.</p>
<p> I want two seats to the premiere.</p>
<p> And my wife needs a seat as well.</p>
<p> And I'm not thanking the Georgia Film Commission, no matter what.</p>
<p> We will need to pray on this, Brother Homer.</p>
<p> Of course.</p>
<p> So will we.</p>
<p> Kneel down, boy.</p>
<p> What for?</p>
<p> Because we're going to pray like we often do.</p>
<p> Heavenly God, who art in heaven, holler out your name.</p>
<p> Thy Kingdom come.</p>
<p> I'm almost done.</p>
<p> Ooh.</p>
<p> Can this square join your circle?</p>
<p> Absotively-posilutely.</p>
<p> In that same spirit, I'm glad to hear it.</p>
<p> - Oh, hi-diddly-do.</p>
<p> - A-dum-dum-diddly.</p>
<p> - Diddly-doodly, brother.</p>
<p> - Diddly-doodly-diddly-dice.</p>
<p> - Nice to diddly meet you.</p>
<p> - Brotherino.</p>
<p> I heard movie meetings were horrible, but I had no idea.</p>
<p> Well, perhaps you could write the screenplay with Brother Homer.</p>
<p> Um, eh, I don't think so.</p>
<p> Wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p> I'm being filled with the spirit of Jesus.</p>
<p> Oh, yeah?</p>
<p> What's he saying?</p>
<p> He says he wants Dad and Mr.</p>
<p> Flanders to work together day after day in a tiny room, preferably holding hands.</p>
<p> Why, you No booze, sodas, or chocolate milk.</p>
<p> And the only snacks are celery sticks.</p>
<p> Celery sticks.</p>
<p> - [GROANS]</p>
<p> - Not done yet.</p>
<p> Dad, Jesus wants you to take Flanders bowling.</p>
<p> - [ANGRY GROAN]</p>
<p> - Tie his shoes for him.</p>
<p> - What for?</p>
<p> - And kiss his ball.</p>
<p> - Why, you - This is the Word of the Lord.</p>
<p> With that kind of attention, I could roll a 73.</p>
<p> [GROANING]: Oh What are you guys doing?</p>
<p> What's it look like?</p>
<p> We're working.</p>
<p> [ANNOYED GRUNT]</p>
<p> Maybe we should take a break.</p>
<p> Good idea.</p>
<p> Okay, come on.</p>
<p> Lenny, you've pitched &quot;That's what she said&quot; 30 times already.</p>
<p> I highly doubt that's the Word of God.</p>
<p> - Try something else.</p>
<p> - That's what she said.</p>
<p> [LAUGHS]</p>
<p> That's great!</p>
<p> That's going in.</p>
<p> Mine.</p>
<p> Mine.</p>
<p> Mine.</p>
<p> Mine.</p>
<p> Lenny and me.</p>
<p> Mine.</p>
<p> Mostly mine.</p>

<p> I was thinking it when Barney said it.</p>
<p> Mine.</p>
<p> Reading for Marge Emily Deschanel.</p>
<p> Oh, yeah.</p>
<p> Uh, first, I have a question for you.</p>
<p> On Bones, did you ever have any bones with meat left on them, and if so, where are those bones?</p>
<p> Maybe she should just read the part.</p>
<p> [AS MARGE]: Homie, because of everything that's happened, I think we need to take a break.</p>
<p> [CRYING]: No!</p>
<p> Marge, no!</p>
<p> A break means forever.</p>
<p> I'll change.</p>
<p> I will.</p>
<p> No, Homer, she's just acting the part.</p>
<p> Oh.</p>
<p> Oh, of course, of course, yes.</p>
<p> As a help to me, when you're acting, could you hold up one hand so I'll know?</p>
<p> Oh, o-okay.</p>
<p> - Thank you.</p>
<p> - [AS MARGE]: Homie.</p>
<p> Yes, Marge.</p>
<p> You have a question?</p>
<p> Ugh.</p>
<p> She's acting!</p>
<p> Right, right, right.</p>
<p> She's acting.</p>
<p> When you're acting, could you raise one arm and swing your foot in a circle and keep winking?</p>
<p> [AS MARGE]: Listen, Homie.</p>
<p> Marge, what are you doing?!</p>
<p> You're acting really weird.</p>
<p> Is he okay?</p>
<p> You thought I was okay when you married me.</p>
<p> [HUFFS]</p>

<p> Gal Gadot reading for Lisa.</p>
<p> - You've got the part!</p>
<p> - Wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p> I know you were great in Fast and Furious, but what else have you been in?</p>
<p> Uh did you see Wonder Woman?</p>
<p> Whenever I see the DC logo, I immediately fall asleep.</p>
<p> Homer, she's got the part.</p>
<p> Okay, you get this and I get Gene Hackman for me.</p>
<p> Huh.</p>
<p> He already said no.</p>
<p> Then you have to help me kidnap him.</p>
<p> GAL: Excuse me.</p>
<p> So, do you want to put me on tape or?</p>
<p> Hey!</p>
<p> Can we use your magic lasso to kidnap Gene Hackman?</p>
<p> No.</p>
<p> Barney is here to read for Noah.</p>
<p> There's no Noah in this movie.</p>
<p> All right, but you better tell the camels.</p>

<p> Mom, do you really believe Bart's story?</p>
<p> Lisa, do you know how I've gotten to this point in life?</p>
<p> Two things blind faith and a little wine.</p>
<p> Can you get me the wine that I keep in Mommy's knitting basket?</p>
<p> I know where you keep it.</p>
<p> There was no knitting in there.</p>
<p> [GULPS]</p>
<p> Ah!</p>
<p> Jesus said to tell you, &quot;Things will get better. &quot; And cut.</p>
<p> I wish you and I had a relationship like that.</p>
<p> Why, you little They wish they had a relationship like us!</p>
<p> Uh, there is nothing a director can do on set that's wrong.</p>
<p> Take five, everybody.</p>
<p> What do you want?</p>
<p> I told you, lies lead to punishment, especially when you film them.</p>
<p> What are you talking about?</p>
<p> If you really saw Grandpa Bouvier, which finger was he missing?</p>
<p> I believe he was wearing a beekeeping outfit when I saw him.</p>
<p> [CHUCKLES]</p>
<p> Trick question.</p>
<p> He's missing a leg.</p>
<p> BART: Okay.</p>
<p> So maybe I fudged a few things.</p>
<p> It's not the original lie that gets people.</p>
<p> It's the cover-up.</p>
<p> It's gonna get worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.</p>
<p> Dad, I'm starting to feel weird.</p>
<p> I'm not your Dad.</p>
<p> I'm the actor playing him.</p>
<p> You need all that padding to play Homer?</p>
<p> Yes, and I'm fat to begin with.</p>
<p> Okay, this one's for China.</p>
<p> This one's for Australia.</p>
<p> And this one's for the youth market.</p>
<p> - Dad?</p>
<p> - This is all because of you.</p>
<p> I have never been so excited.</p>
<p> Now what do you want to say?</p>
<p> Um, is there anything you want to tell anyone?</p>
<p> Any inaccuracies or blatant lies?</p>
<p> [QUIETLY]: The scene we said is New York is actually downtown Calgary, and vice versa.</p>
<p> [SIGHS]</p>
<p> [GROANING]</p>
<p> No, no.</p>
<p> I'm going to heaven!</p>
<p> [HEAVENLY CHORUS SINGS]</p>
<p> [SCRAPING]</p>
<p> Hello, Bart.</p>
<p> Didn't they give you a real leg in heaven?</p>
<p> I lost it in a bet.</p>
<p> A bet that my grandson was a good boy.</p>
<p> Save me, Jesus!</p>
<p> I'm trying very hard to forgive you.</p>
<p> It is very tough.</p>
<p> [WHIMPERS]</p>
<p> What are you gonna do to me?</p>
<p> Bart, God is love.</p>
<p> [HEAVENLY CHORUS SINGS]</p>
<p> [GRUNTING]</p>
<p> [BART GRUNTS]</p>
<p> And here's Marge with the actress who played her.</p>
<p> Oh, in real life we don't get along.</p>
<p> [REPORTERS CLAMORING]</p>
<p> Who are you worshipping?</p>
<p> Are you telling the truth?</p>
<p> He will not be taking any questions unless they're submitted in writing on an index card with some bacon on it.</p>
<p> Turkey bacon does not count.</p>
<p> Tell the people what you have witnessed, Bartholomew.</p>
<p> And if they doubt you, viciously attack their character.</p>
<p> Yes, Jesus.</p>
<p> Bart, you're my hero.</p>
<p> Now, who wants a hamburger?</p>
<p> I would never say any of those things.</p>
<p> Now sing, Bart.</p>
<p> - Sing because I cannot.</p>
<p> - [LISA GROANS]</p>
<p> One more chance It is my destiny To start my road To Christianity I always knew he had a mission Thank God we called off the mortician One more chance ALL: He's alive, someone quick call Channel 5 One more chance.</p>
<p> Eh.</p>
<p> Not enough Bart.</p>
<p> Oh, someone pinch me.</p>
<p> Thank you.</p>
<p> Thank you for this Christian Oscar.</p>
<p> And I'd like to thank the Academy of Arts and Anti-Sciences.</p>
<p> [KNOCKING]</p>
<p> Are you guys awake?</p>
<p> Mm.</p>
<p> What's the matter, sweetie?</p>
<p> Mom, I lied about everything.</p>
<p> Oh, my God!</p>
<p> Don't worry, Marge.</p>
<p> It's just a little movie.</p>
<p> Nobody will see it.</p>
<p> Mr.</p>
<p> Flanders just called.</p>
<p> The movie's on pace to make a hundred million dollars.</p>
<p> It crushed all the good movies that came out this week.</p>
<p> Take that, Paul Thomas Anderson.</p>
<p> Oh, my God.</p>
<p> Our movie's a hit and a lie.</p>
<p> Oh, all hit movies are lies, Marge.</p>
<p> Did you see Argo?</p>
<p> None of that happened.</p>
<p> And I have strong doubts about The Incredibles.</p>
<p> Well, we have to tell people the truth.</p>
<p> Of course, of course.</p>
<p> Could we do it after the Golden Globes?</p>
<p> MARGE, LISA AND BART: No!</p>
<p> But that's the one with TV people and movie people in the same room.</p>
<p> We said no!</p>
<p> [PROTESTERS CLAMORING]</p>
<p> FLANDERS: First off, we will donate every penny of our profits to charity.</p>
<p> Keeping only enough money to cover changing our lives in a major way.</p>
<p> - Hey, what is this?</p>
<p> - [OVERLAPPING CHATTER]</p>
<p> Fine, fine, fine, all of it.</p>
<p> Okay, look, I just want to say, I'm just a man trying to raise his son.</p>
<p> I make mistakes.</p>
<p> Sometimes they're little, sometimes they're big.</p>
<p> Blame me, but don't blame the boy for being a boy.</p>
<p> [SNIFFS]</p>
<p> Oh.</p>
<p> And let me just ask this.</p>
<p> Is it possible any other religious beliefs are founded on myths?</p>
<p> This interview is over.</p>
<p> God created the world in seven days.</p>
<p> See you later.</p>
<p> In what some are calling the worst scandal in the history of religion, Bart Simpson lied when he claimed he had talked to Jesus.</p>
<p> But maybe part of the fault lies with us for desperately wanting a miracle in these troubled times.</p>
<p> Times which we bring into your homes at 5:00, 6:00 and 11:00.</p>
<p> Here's a hobo lost in a hurricane.</p>
<p> Um, I had a hat!</p>
<p> Hey, Bart.</p>
<p> I brought you some ice cream.</p>
<p> BART: Up here.</p>
<p> The only friend I have is the Frisbee on the roof.</p>
<p> [WIND WHISTLING]</p>
<p> Hmm.</p>
<p> Well, you'll always have me.</p>
<p> - [SHINGLES CREAKING]</p>
<p> - Careful.</p>
<p> Dad didn't nail these in too well.</p>
<p> You think God'll forgive me?</p>
<p> Don't tell anyone I said that.</p>
<p> Well, if there is a God, from what I know, said God will forgive you if you truly have remorse in your heart.</p>
<p> Well, thanks, Lis.</p>
<p> Don't tell anyone I asked you that.</p>
<p> I did it 'cause you're the smartest person I know.</p>
<p> And don't tell anybody I said that.</p>
<p> I won't!</p>
<p> [BOTH SCREAMING]</p>
<p> [SIGHS]</p>
<p> Dad must have raked the leaves today.</p>
<p> Now that's a miracle.</p>
<p> I made it.</p>
<p> Gal Gadot?!</p>
<p> They like me so much, I get to visit.</p>
<p> I made it, too, boy, and Jesus really wants to meet you.</p>
<p> Go on in!</p>
<p> Where are you going?</p>
<p> This place is so boring.</p>
<p> FLANDERS: Time for another game of &quot;Mother, May I?&quot; </p>
<p> [GROANING]: Oh!</p>
<p> Please send me back to Earth.</p>
<p> Yes, yes.</p>
<p> You can be a turtle or a pharmaceutical CEO.</p>
<p> Turtle, please.</p>
<p> Hmm.</p>
