							<p>Stop fighting with your sister!</p>
<p>She took my glue!</p>
<p>It's not yours! This is family glue!</p>
<p>Stop it! This is Thanksgiving!</p>
<p>So glue friendly, or I'll take your glue away!</p>
<p>This isn't about glue.</p>
<p>He only wants the glue because I'm using it.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? Prove it!</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>Hey, man, I don't want your stupid glue.</p>
<p>Here comes our friend, Bullwinkle J. Moose.</p>
<p>Bullwinkle's antler's sprung a leak.</p>
<p>Bullwinkle got a taste of his own medicine.</p>
<p>He certainly did, Bill.</p>
<p>Wait, what did--?</p>
<p>Did that make sense?</p>
<p>Not really, Bill.</p>
<p>Now I know how the Pilgrims felt.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Who the hell is that?</p>
<p>Bullwinkle.</p>
<p>Who's that?</p>
<p>Underdog. Don't you know anything?</p>
<p>They should use cartoons made in the last 50 years.</p>
<p>This is a tradition.</p>
<p>If you build a balloon for every cartoon character... you'll turn the parade into a farce.</p>
<p>Maggie! I'm about to unveil my centerpiece.</p>
<p>It's a tribute to the women who made our country great.</p>
<p>See, there's Georgia O'Keeffe, Susan B. Anthony... and this is Marjory Stoneman Douglas.</p>
<p>She worked her whole life to preserve the Florida Everglades.</p>
<p>Would you like to contribute something to it?</p>
<p>Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>Honey, you're in the way.</p>
<p>Can't I help?</p>
<p>Well, okay. Can you do the cranberry sauce?</p>
<p>Yeah! Where is it?</p>
<p>The can is in the cupboard.</p>
<p>Here?</p>
<p>No, the other shelf.</p>
<p>Got it. Now what?</p>
<p>Open the can.</p>
<p>Where's the can opener?</p>
<p>It's in the second drawer from the right. No, no, the other one.</p>
<p>Oh, I got you.</p>
<p>It's broken, Mom. Mom, it's broken.</p>
<p>Mom, it's broken Mom, it's broken</p>
<p>I don't think that it's broken. Here, let me try.</p>
<p>Here you go.</p>
<p>Cranberry sauce à la Bart.</p>
<p>Just stick it in the refrigerator when you're done, Bart. Bart?</p>
<p>Those silver-and-blue guys are the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
<p>They're Daddy's favorite team.</p>
<p>He wants them to lose by less than five points.</p>
<p>Kogen's got Wolodarsky open way down field. Oh, what a hit!</p>
<p>Yeah, he's out cold, Gil.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>They'll feed him dinner through a tube.</p>
<p>Hope they can fit a turkey in there.</p>
<p>Homer, you should pick up Grandpa.</p>
<p>Halftime, Marge.</p>
<p>Here comes the cavalry.</p>
<p>You promised to be nice to my sisters.</p>
<p>I know, I will.</p>
<p>You brought food?</p>
<p>Just a few things. Swedish meatballs.</p>
<p>And my trout almondine.</p>
<p>You knew I was cooking a turkey.</p>
<p>Which is fine.</p>
<p>More power to you.</p>
<p>Some people find your turkey a little dry.</p>
<p>Now they'll have an option.</p>
<p>Hi, Patty. Hi, Selma.</p>
<p>It's good to see you. Gotta pick up my old man! Bye!</p>
<p>So insincere.</p>
<p>How does she put up with him?</p>
<p>And now, get set for our fabulous halftime show... featuring the young go-getters of Hurray for Everything!</p>
<p>I love those kids! They got such a great attitude!</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, Hurray for Everything... invites you to join them in a salute to the greatest hemisphere... the Western hemisphere! The dancing-est hemisphere!</p>
<p>Before we sit down to our delicious turkey purée... I have happy news.</p>
<p>These people have relatives who wish they could be here: Antonowski, Conroy, Falcone, Martin, Thorsen, and Walsh.</p>
<p>Oh, and Mrs. Spencer, you too.</p>
<p>Oh, I knew they wouldn't forget me.</p>
<p>Dad, let's get out of here.</p>
<p>What's your hurry?</p>
<p>This place is depressing.</p>
<p>Hey, I live here!</p>
<p>Well, I'm sure it's a blast once you get used to it.</p>
<p>Mom, you made it! How are you?!</p>
<p>I have laryngitis and it hurts to talk, so I'll just say one thing: You never do anything right.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>You're super!</p>
<p>In the Silverdome, now ablaze with flashbulbs... as Hurray for Everything leaves!</p>
<p>A stadium's too big for flash pictures to work, but nobody cares!</p>
<p>That's no way to lay a fire!</p>
<p>This will roar any time now.</p>
<p>A caveman could start it.</p>
<p>Dinner! Dinnertime, everybody!</p>
<p>The hell with this.</p>
<p>Okay, Lisa, we're ready for your centerpiece.</p>
<p>Lisa, my goodness. That's very impressive.</p>
<p>Holy moly! That's the biggest one of those I ever saw!</p>
<p>I always said she was gifted.</p>
<p>Definitely from our side. Right, Mom?</p>
<p>Leave me be.</p>
<p>How long did that take you?</p>
<p>I couldn't tell you. It was a labor of love.</p>
<p>It's my homage to some heroes... who may not have fought any wars, but who--</p>
<p>Speaking of heroes, here's mine: Tom Turkey!</p>
<p>Yikes! What is that?</p>
<p>It's the centerpiece.</p>
<p>It's taking up real estate.</p>
<p>Stop it!</p>
<p>Move it, toots!</p>
<p>Mom!</p>
<p>I'm sure there's room for both.</p>
<p>Let me....</p>
<p>Bart, you're wrecking it! Let go! I worked forever on this!</p>
<p>Hey, that got her going!</p>
<p>Bitchen!</p>
<p>Bart! You don't even care! You don't even care!</p>
<p>All right, that's it! Go to your room now!</p>
<p>I'll take some white meat to go, and send up the pie.</p>
<p>I said now!</p>
<p>Mom, do I have to?</p>
<p>Yes, you do! I hope you're happy, Bart!</p>
<p>You've ruined Thanksgiving!</p>
<p>I didn't ruin Thanksgiving, she did. I always get blamed.</p>
<p>And Lord, we're thankful for nuclear power... the cleanest, safest energy source... except for solar, which is a pipe dream.</p>
<p>Thank you for the occasional moments of love our family's experienced.</p>
<p>Not today. You saw what happened!</p>
<p>Lord, be honest! Are we the most pathetic family in the universe?</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>Worst prayer yet.</p>

<p>Why don't I go talk to the children?</p>
<p>Don't worry, Marge will fix everything.</p>
<p>Honey, your food is getting cold.</p>
<p>That's all right.</p>
<p>I'm sorry about what happened.</p>
<p>I poured my heart into that centerpiece!</p>
<p>Things like that always happen in this family!</p>
<p>I've noticed that.</p>
<p>When you feel like coming down, we'll be there.</p>
<p>You can come down to dinner when you're ready to apologize.</p>
<p>And it's going to be a real apology in front of everybody.</p>
<p>Apologize? For what? Clearing the table? Having a sense of humor?</p>
<p>They think they can starve an apology out of me?</p>
<p>Uh-oh. I mean, good!</p>
<p>Hey, what are you doing?! No! Drop that drumstick!</p>
<p>Bad dog! Bad Santa's Helper.</p>
<p>Come on, give me that. Give me that! Don't! Okay, out you go!</p>
<p>Boy, come here. You're a good dog.</p>
<p>We don't need them to get a Thanksgiving dinner.</p>
<p>Wow! Swanky!</p>
<p>Smithers, every year you outstrip yourself in succulence.</p>
<p>Thank you, sir. Would you like some yams?</p>
<p>No, I couldn't eat another bite. Dispose of all this.</p>
<p>I did save room for your special pumpkin pie.</p>
<p>It's cooling on the windowsill.</p>
<p>Stay here, boy.</p>
<p>Mr. Burns? Base command.</p>
<p>The intruder is a young male, age 9 to 11.</p>
<p>Release the hounds.</p>
<p>I saw the best meals of my generation destroyed</p>
<p>By the madness of my brother</p>
<p>My soul carved in slices by spiky-haired demons</p>
<p>Don't worry. We'll get some grub. Even if we have to pay for it.</p>
<p>Cool! The wrong side of the tracks.</p>
<p>Twelve bucks! Hey, I can bleed.</p>
<p>You've gotta be 18. Let's see some I.D.</p>
<p>Here you go, doll face.</p>
<p>Okay, Homer. Just relax.</p>
<p>At the risk of losing my voice... let me just say one more thing: I'm sorry I came.</p>
<p>When's that boy gonna apologize?</p>
<p>He's stubborn.</p>
<p>Homer was never stubborn. He always folded instantly.</p>
<p>As if he had no will of his own.</p>
<p>Isn't that true, Homer?</p>
<p>Yes, Dad.</p>
<p>Twelve bucks and a free cookie. What a country.</p>
<p>Cute little guy.</p>
<p>He's coming around.</p>
<p>You look a little pale, son.</p>
<p>We better get you some food.</p>
<p>Here we are.</p>
<p>All right! Twelve big ones and free grub!</p>
<p>Viva skid row! Hey, it's that anchor dude from Channel 6.</p>
<p>He's doing one of those be-thankful stories.</p>
<p>We have lots of names for these people: Bums, b*at, losers, scums of the earth.</p>
<p>We'd like to sweep them into the gutter or to some other out-of-the-way place.</p>
<p>Oh, we have our reasons: They're depressing.</p>
<p>They're crazy. They smell bad.</p>
<p>Hey, listen, man.</p>
<p>I'm going somewhere.</p>
<p>So every year on one lone, conscience-salving day... we toss these people a bone. A turkey bone.</p>
<p>That's supposed to make it all better.</p>
<p>You won't find the freeloader or Charlie Chaplin's little tramp here.</p>
<p>Pompous, blow-dried, college boy!</p>
<p>His girlfriend does the weather.</p>
<p>You don't say.</p>
<p>Lisa wants to read us a poem she's written.</p>
<p>Sounds interesting.</p>
<p>&quot;Howl of the Unappreciated&quot; by Lisa Simpson.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw the best meals--&quot;</p>
<p>It's Bart!</p>
<p>What show is this?</p>
<p>How long have you been on the streets?</p>
<p>Five years.</p>
<p>Your family may be watching.</p>
<p>Anything you'd like to say?</p>
<p>Ha-ha! I didn't apologize!</p>
<p>Oh, no! My sweet, little Bart.</p>
<p>Give me the number for 911!</p>
<p>Thanks for your help. This reporter smells another Emmy.</p>
<p>We're rooting for you. Got someplace to sleep tonight, Bart?</p>
<p>Yeah, there's this family I hang out with.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty sweet.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess it is.</p>
<p>See you at Christmas.</p>
<p>Guys, unless you feel weird about taking money... from a kid, I thought....</p>
<p>I wouldn't feel weird.</p>
<p>I'm comfortable with it.</p>
<p>Forget the report? He's down at the Rescue Mission!</p>
<p>He's long gone.</p>
<p>Can you think of a reason why he ran away?</p>
<p>Well, we did kind of yell at him and sent him to his room... and forced him to apologize to his sister.</p>
<p>I said he ruined Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>Best Thanksgiving ever, eh, boy?</p>
<p>Goodbye. I'm sure Bart will be back.</p>
<p>I'd say something comforting, but you know, my voice.</p>
<p>Let's go! If I'm not back at the home by 9... they declare me dead and collect my insurance.</p>
<p>This is a terrible thing that's happened.</p>
<p>But we can't blame ourselves.</p>
<p>We can!</p>
<p>Children need discipline. Ask any advice columnist.</p>
<p>Marge, are we ever gonna see him again?</p>
<p>Should I or shouldn't I?</p>
<p>Hey, everybody, I'm home.</p>
<p>Bart? You're home!</p>
<p>Oh, my special little guy! We were so worried!</p>
<p>Boy, we were afraid we'd lost you!</p>
<p>Welcome back, Bart. I'm sorry we had such a terrible fight.</p>
<p>Isn't there something you'd like to say to her?</p>
<p>Okay, I'm sorry too.</p>
<p>No, no, no! That won't do at all!</p>
<p>Get down on your knees and beg for forgiveness.</p>
<p>Yeah, beg me, Bart. Beg me!</p>
<p>Lisa, I beg of you, please forgive me.</p>
<p>Now we can blame him for everything!</p>
<p>It's your fault I'm bald!</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>It's your fault I'm old!</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>It's your fault I can't talk!</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>It's your fault America has lost its way.</p>
<p>It's all your fault.</p>
<p>I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!</p>
<p>I'm sorry all right. Sorry I came back here!</p>
<p>Whoa! My whiffle balls, my water rockets!</p>
<p>Jackpot! A sellout crowd at the Super Bowl... Simpson down by six with two seconds left.</p>
<p>He's got Simpson in the open.</p>
<p>Touchdown, Simpson!</p>
<p>The boy nobody wanted just won the Super Bowl!</p>
<p>Dear Log, my brother is still missing... and maybe it's my fault. I failed to take his abuse with humor.</p>
<p>I miss him so much already that I don't know....</p>
<p>Hey, Lisa! It's me, Bart!</p>
<p>Bart? Where are you?</p>
<p>I'm on the roof.</p>
<p>What are you doing? Everybody's worried.</p>
<p>Did they cry?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Bull's-eye!</p>
<p>Why did you burn my centerpiece?</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Because you hate me or because you're bad?</p>
<p>I don't know. I don't know why I enjoyed it... or why I'll do it again!</p>
<p>Just tell me you're sorry.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>The only reason to apologize is if you look... inside yourself and find a spot you wish wasn't there... because you feel bad you hurt my feelings.</p>
<p>Leave me alone.</p>
<p>Just look!</p>
<p>Okay, okay. Looking for the spot.</p>
<p>Still checking. This is stupid. I won't find anything.</p>
<p>Just because I wrecked something she worked hard at and made her--</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Lisa.</p>
<p>Apology accepted.</p>
<p>You know, Marge, we're great parents.</p>
<p>O Lord, we thank thee... for giving us one more crack at togetherness.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
