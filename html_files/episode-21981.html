<p>Hello, I'm Kent Brockman, and this is Eye on Springfield.</p>
<p>Tonight, Springfield's answer to the Benedictine monks: The rapping rabbis.</p>
<p>Don 't eat pork Not even with a fork.</p>
<p>Can 't touch this.</p>
<p>Marge, are we Jewish?</p>
<p>No, Homer.</p>
<p>But first, we all stink.</p>
<p>We all... Hey!</p>
<p>According to a survey ranking Springfield as the least popular city in America.</p>
<p>In science, dead last.</p>
<p>I'm telling you people, the Earth revolves around the sun.</p>
<p>Burn him!</p>
<p>What a story.</p>
<p>You've stolen my soul!</p>
<p>In culture, dead last.</p>
<p>Eleanor, we've got to do something about this depression. So I propose...</p>
<p>Oh, that's right. I'm crippled.</p>
<p>This is terrible. People will start to avoid Springfield.</p>
<p>But what can I do? I'm just... one man.</p>
<p>I think we should call a town meeting.</p>
<p>If we don't do something soon, we won't get any tourists.</p>
<p>No tourists? I'll be ruined.</p>
<p>Maps to movie stars' homes!</p>
<p>Excuse me, are you Drew Barrymore?</p>
<p>What? Get out of here. I'm hung-over.</p>
<p>Sorry, Miss Barrymore.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Are there any suggestions for how to attract more tourism?</p>
<p>The easiest way to be popular is to leech off the popularity of others.</p>
<p>So we propose changing our name from Springfield to Seinfeld.</p>
<p>I may be just a boy, but I have an idea.</p>
<p>If I may, I'd like to show you a few slides.</p>
<p>Springfield as it appears from space.</p>
<p>Somewhere in this windy valley is the Lost Dutchman's Mine.</p>
<p>Young man, that appears to be a picture of your rear end.</p>
<p>So long, suckers.</p>
<p>This is the last time I use an escape plan devised by Milhouse.</p>
<p>Sorry, Bart.</p>
<p>I'm Marge Simpson, and I have an idea.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Marge is gonna say something.</p>
<p>Now, I know you haven't liked some of my past suggestions.</p>
<p>Like switching to the metric system.</p>
<p>The metric system is the tool of the devil!</p>
<p>My car gets 40 rods to the hogshead, and that's the way I likes it!</p>
<p>The old person's remarks will be stricken.</p>
<p>Who said that?</p>
<p>But my new idea is different.</p>
<p>I think we should hold a film festival and give out prizes.</p>
<p>Could we make movies and enter them?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>At last, an excuse to wear makeup.</p>
<p>All in favor of Marge Simpson's film-festival idea?</p>
<p>Film festival! Film festival!</p>
<p>You like my idea? Actually, I have several others.</p>
<p>Don 't push your luck! Don 't push your luck!</p>
<p>And action.</p>
<p>Hello, I'm Bart Simpson.</p>
<p>In the past, I've brought you such classic films as Homer in the Shower... and Homer on the Toilet.</p>
<p>And now I give you The Eternal Struggle.</p>
<p>Relaxed fit, my Aunt Fanny. Stupid Dockers.</p>
<p>Oh, the belt is buckled.</p>
<p>Now, Maude, in our movie, you lay baby Moses in the basket... then put it among the reeds, okay?</p>
<p>Lights, camera... act-diddily-dotilly-doodilly action Jackson.</p>
<p>Help me!</p>
<p>Flanders to God Flanders to God.</p>
<p>Get off your cloud and save my Todd.</p>
<p>Thanks, God.</p>
<p>Okely-dokely.</p>
<p>What you doing, Ma?</p>
<p>Looking for a film critic to judge our festival.</p>
<p>Did you know there are over 600 critics on TV... and Leonard Maltin is the best-looking of them all?</p>
<p>Welcome to Coming Attractions. I'm your host, Jay Sherman. Thank you.</p>
<p>Tonight we review an aging Charles Bronson in Death Wish IX.</p>
<p>I wish I was dead.</p>
<p>But first we have a special guest, Rainier Wolfcastle... star of the reprehensible McBain movies.</p>
<p>Jay, my new film is a mix of action und comedy.</p>
<p>It's called McBain: Let's Get Silly.</p>
<p>Did you ever notice how men always leave the toilet seat up?</p>
<p>That's the joke.</p>
<p>You suck, McBain!</p>
<p>Now my Woody Allen impression.</p>
<p>I'm a neurotic nerd who likes to sleep with little girls.</p>
<p>Hey, that really sucked!</p>
<p>The film is just me in front of a brick wall for an hour and a half.</p>
<p>It cost $80 million.</p>
<p>How do you sleep at night?</p>
<p>On top of a pile of money with many beautiful ladies.</p>
<p>Just asking.</p>
<p>I like him. He's smart, he's sensitive.</p>
<p>He's not obsessed with his physical appearance.</p>
<p>My ears are burning.</p>
<p>I wasn't talking about you, Dad.</p>
<p>No, my ears are really burning. I wanted to see inside, so I lit a Q-Tip.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Sherman, on behalf of the people of Springfield... I would like to invite you to judge our film festival.</p>
<p>You can stay with us and enjoy the sights and sounds of the country.</p>
<p>Marge, is this a pimple or a boil?</p>
<p>Just a minute, Homer.</p>
<p>Look what you made me write.</p>
<p>Anyway, we think you'll really enjoy our quiet little town.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Marge Simpson.</p>
<p>Do I really wanna leave Manhattan?</p>
<p>Sherman, I just realized you insulted me. Now you will die.</p>
<p>Hey, nudnik, your shoe's untied.</p>
<p>From here, they appear to be tied. But I will go in for a closer look.</p>
<p>Taxi. To the airport!</p>
<p>On closer inspection, these are Loafers.</p>
<p>Attention, the flight from New York has arrived.</p>
<p>Hey, I'm landing here.</p>
<p>It's supposed to say Jay's name, not yours.</p>
<p>Oh, you're right.</p>
<p>There you...</p>
<p>Just a second. Oh, that should...</p>
<p>Hello, I'm Marge Simpson, and this is my husband, Homer.</p>
<p>Oh, nice to meet you, Marge. I saw your hair from the plane.</p>
<p>And you must be the man who didn't know if he had a pimple or a boil.</p>
<p>It was a gummy bear.</p>
<p>Coming up next, The Flintstones Meet the Jetsons.</p>
<p>I smell another cheap cartoon crossover.</p>
<p>Bart Simpson, meet Jay Sherman the critic.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Hey, man, I really love your show.</p>
<p>I think all kids should watch it.</p>
<p>I suddenly feel so dirty.</p>
<p>I don't know what's happening. It seems our profits have dropped 37 percent.</p>
<p>We have a bad image, sir.</p>
<p>Research shows people see you as something of an ogre.</p>
<p>I ought to club them and eat their bones.</p>
<p>Maybe this film festival could help us.</p>
<p>A film biography might let them get to know the real you.</p>
<p>Virtuous, heroic, nubile.</p>
<p>You left out &quot;pleasant.&quot;</p>
<p>But I like that film-biography idea.</p>
<p>A slick Hollywood picture to gloss over my evil rise to power... like Bugsy or Working Girl.</p>
<p>Get me Steven Spielberg.</p>
<p>He's unavailable.</p>
<p>Get his nonunion Mexican equivalent.</p>
<p>Listen, Señor Spielbergo... I want you to do for me what Spielberg did for Oskar Schindler.</p>
<p>Listen, Spielbergo, Schindler and I are like peas in a pod.</p>
<p>We're both factory owners. We both made shells for the n*zi.</p>
<p>But mine worked, damn it. Now, go out there and win me that festival!</p>
<p>Homer, the guest should get the last pork chop.</p>
<p>But I'm still hungry.</p>
<p>Mr. Sherman, I understand you have two Pulitzer Prizes.</p>
<p>Well, it's not like I carry them around with me.</p>
<p>It's so hot in here.</p>
<p>Oh, look, here's my People's Choice Award. Five Golden Globes...</p>
<p>Where's my Emmy?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content"><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle transcripts-topic-in-post" style="display:inline-block" data-full-width-responsive="true" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3808023418243141" data-ad-slot="1728561479"></ins>
<p><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div></p>
<p>Yeah, well, I won... the belching contest at work.</p>
<p>Very nice, Homer.</p>
<p>Wow, how many Pulitzer Prize winners can do that?</p>
<p>Just me and Eudora Welty.</p>
<p>I invited my sisters over.</p>
<p>Sisters. Allow me.</p>
<p>So then I said to Woody Allen, &quot;Well, Camus can do, but Sartre is 'smartre.'&quot;</p>
<p>So original.</p>
<p>How droll.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, Scooby-Doo can doo-doo... but Jimmy Carter is smarter.</p>
<p>Okay, Sherman, you're a movie expert.</p>
<p>So tell us, who's gay?</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know. Harvey Fierstein.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Who else?</p>
<p>MacGyver's gay.</p>
<p>You badmouthed MacGyver, didn't you?</p>
<p>What you doing, Marge?</p>
<p>Making the jury list for the film festival.</p>
<p>Mayor Quimby, Krusty, Jay.</p>
<p>Marge, do you respect my intelligence?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Why did it take you so long to say yes?</p>
<p>No reason.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Are you humoring me?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. That's bad!</p>
<p>Look, I know I'm not witty like that critic guy... but does he know all the words to the Oscar Mayer song?</p>
<p>Oh, I wish I were an Oscar Mayer wiener.</p>
<p>That is what I'd truly like to be 'Cause if I were an Oscar Mayer wiener.</p>
<p>Everyone would be in love with me.</p>
<p>That's it, Marge. He knows the whole hot-dog song.</p>
<p>Go ahead, sleep with him. I'll just take a lock of your hair to remember you by.</p>
<p>It's just you and me now, lock of hair.</p>
<p>You don't have to do this.</p>
<p>You think I'm stupid.</p>
<p>I don't think you're stupid.</p>
<p>Prove it. Put me on that film-jury-festival thing.</p>
<p>Fine. You're on the jury.</p>
<p>Sir, the actors are here to audition for the part of you.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Next.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Next.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Next.</p>
<p>Oh, it's hopeless. I'll have to play myself.</p>
<p>I thought they were playing The Rocky Horror Picture Show tonight.</p>
<p>Our first film is by lndian director Apu Nahasapeemapetilon.</p>
<p>Bright Lights, Beef Jerky.</p>
<p>Help! Help! Police!</p>
<p>Hey, I got problems of my own right now. Oh, boy.</p>
<p>This is gonna get worse before it gets better.</p>
<p>Next, we have Moe the bartender in Moe Better Booze.</p>
<p>Money gets you one more round Drink it down, you stupid clown.</p>
<p>Money gets you one more round You're out on your ass.</p>
<p>My back!</p>
<p>Hans Moleman Productions presents... Man Getting Hit by Football.</p>
<p>This contest is over. Give that man the $ 10,000!</p>
<p>This isn't America 's Funniest Home Videos.</p>
<p>But the ball, his groin. It works on so many levels.</p>
<p>Roll it again.</p>
<p>Next, they're gonna show my movie.</p>
<p>You made a movie?</p>
<p>I made a movie?</p>
<p>No wonder I was on the cover of Entertainment Weekly.</p>
<p>My name is Barney Gumble. I'm 40, I'm single, and I drink.</p>
<p>There's a line in Othello about a drinker.</p>
<p>Now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast.</p>
<p>That pretty well covers it.</p>
<p>It's brilliant. Savagely honest. Tender. He has the soul of a poet.</p>
<p>You're very kind.</p>
<p>Excuse me. Did something crawl down your throat and die?</p>
<p>It didn't die.</p>
<p>My name is Barney, and I'm an alcoholic.</p>
<p>Mr. Gumble, this is a Girl Scout meeting.</p>
<p>Is it? Or is it that you girls can't admit you have a problem?</p>
<p>Don 't cry for me. I'm already dead.</p>
<p>I think we have a winner.</p>
<p>What'd I miss?</p>
<p>Homer, please pay attention.</p>
<p>There's just one more movie.</p>
<p>Simple villagers, I promise you... I will close plants in America and bring work here.</p>
<p>We did 20 takes, and that was the best one.</p>
<p>Remember, Elliott, I'll be right here.</p>
<p>Pure egotism.</p>
<p>Self-indulgent tripe.</p>
<p>I don't care what they say. I'm going to win this festival.</p>
<p>Drink up, Judah Ben-Hur.</p>
<p>You truly are the king of kings.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Smithers, are they booing me?</p>
<p>No. They're saying, &quot;Boo-urns, Boo-urns.&quot;</p>
<p>Are you saying, &quot;Boo,&quot; or, &quot;Boo-urns&quot;?</p>
<p>I was saying, &quot;Boo-urns.&quot;</p>
<p>All right, it's time to vote for the grand prize.</p>
<p>I vote for Barney Gumble's sensitive yet unfortunately titled film, Pukahantas.</p>
<p>Second!</p>
<p>Well, I vote for Burns' movie.</p>
<p>Me too. Now let's get going. I got a date with Eudora Welty.</p>
<p>Coming, Eudora!</p>
<p>Excellent. Bribing those two judges has paid off.</p>
<p>Like the Miss Teen America pageant.</p>
<p>How can you vote for Burns' movie?</p>
<p>Let's just say it moved me to a bigger house!</p>
<p>I said the quiet part loud and the loud part quiet. Oh, dear.</p>
<p>Two to two. Well, Homer, it all comes down to you.</p>
<p>Football in the Groin! Football in the Groin!</p>
<p>We're not gonna resolve this deadlock anytime soon.</p>
<p>Why don't we all take a five-minute break. It'll clear our heads.</p>
<p>Good idea, Marge. My mind is going a mile a minute.</p>
<p>I knew this would happen. I put you on the jury... and you vote for the stupidest film.</p>
<p>I have a right to be on that jury... even though I'm sleeping with the head of the festival.</p>
<p>How many times have I heard Rex Reed say that?</p>
<p>Great. Now you're gonna make fun of me.</p>
<p>No, Homer. I won't make fun.</p>
<p>But I will suggest there may be better things in life... than seeing a man get hit in the groin with a football.</p>
<p>Well, Homer?</p>
<p>Marge, I've got some serious thinking to do.</p>
<p>Barney's movie had heart.</p>
<p>But Football in the Groin had a football in the groin.</p>
<p>Don 't cry for me. I'm already dead.</p>
<p>Wow, I'll never drink another beer.</p>
<p>Beer here.</p>
<p>I'll take 10.</p>
<p>And now to announce the winners.</p>
<p>The award for outstanding animated short goes to... Itchy and Scratchy for their film Four Funerals and a Wedding.</p>
<p>And now the winner of the grand prize.</p>
<p>Barney Gumble!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Homie, you voted for the right movie. I'm glad you were on the jury.</p>
<p>You know something, Marge? It's not that tough being a film cricket.</p>
<p>I've learned I have a gift to share with the world.</p>
<p>From now on, there'll be a new Barnard Gumble. Hardworking, clean and sober.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Barney. And enjoy your grand prize... a lifetime supply of Duff Beer.</p>
<p>Just hook it to my veins!</p>
<p>Goodbye, Mr. Sherman. If I ever play Carnegie Hall, I'll give you a call.</p>
<p>And if you ever want to visit my show...</p>
<p>We're not gonna be doing that.</p>
<p>I hope you tell your New York friends... that people in small towns aren't quite as dumb as they think.</p>
<p>Marge, look. This has spring snakes inside... but the suckers will think it's beer nuts.</p>
<p>Beer nuts.</p>
<p>Well, it was a lovely festival. The best movie won... and Mr. Burns found there are some awards that can't be bought.</p>
<p>And the Oscar goes to...</p>
<p>I've got to win this one. I bribed everyone in Hollywood.</p>
<p>...George C. Scott in Man Getting Hit by Football.</p>
<p>My groin.</p>
