- Each year, one graduate receives the prestigious  </p>
<p>Golden Baton Award for the most impressive future conductor.   </p>
<p>But this year, we have two worthy recipients.   </p>
<p>- [AUDIENCE GASPING]<br />
- Two?   </p>
<p>That's right.   </p>
<p>Gustavo Dudamel and local wunderkind, Mr. Dewey Largo.   </p>
<p>[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]   </p>
<p>I'm sure you will each achieve tremendous renown.   </p>
<p>No, wait.   </p>
<p>I believe that one of you will.   </p>
<p>And the other will fail and have a horrible life as a public school music teacher.   </p>

<p>You're having that dream again?   </p>
<p>Oh, it's so cruel that my only triumph has become my recurring nightmare.   </p>
<p>Oh, darling, you're cursed with the memory of an elephant.   </p>
<p>And the wrinkles to match.   </p>
<p>Can't you just wake me with a slice of melon and a drop of affection?   </p>
<p>Whatever you say, Lord Grumpy of the Morning Breath.   </p>

<p>Now, Petal, don't forget to call the dog walker.   </p>
<p>Tell him to come early.   </p>
<p>And easy on the leash.   </p>
<p>Oh, it's on my list.   </p>
<p>Also, don't forget to call someone about the water bill.   </p>
<p>I suspect a sputtering spigot.   </p>
<p>You know, you are home all day.   </p>
<p>Hence my annoyance.   </p>

<p>That is so generous.    </p>
<p>Yes, yes, there is an upside to having a broken spirit.    </p>
<p>Mr. Kleskow said my articulation  was the best he's ever heard.    </p>
<p>He said I sounded like a young Cannonball Adderley.    </p>
