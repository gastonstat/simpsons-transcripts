<p>(whirs softly)</p>
<p>May I talk to you in private, please?</p>
<p>Admit it: the only reason you're here is to support me until I lose interest and quit.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not going anywhere, so you can quit.</p>
<p>Maybe I don't want to quit.</p>
<p>Do you realize what a big deal it is to be a space colonist?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>That's why I want to do it!</p>
<p>I think you don't like that I'm just as good at Mars as you.</p>
<p>Maybe even better.</p>
<p>Ha! Hardly.</p>
<p>All you are is a... a stay-at-hab space wife!</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Well, it looks like the ego has landed.</p>
<p>You're the last person I would ever want to go to Mars with.</p>
<p>In ten years.</p>
<p>That's too bad, because I'm going with you.</p>
<p>In ten years.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: On Mars, that would be a door slam!</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like Lisa has no respect for me.</p>
<p>I know, I know.</p>
<p>I'm finally good at something and she has to make it into a competition.</p>
<p>That must be really hard for you.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry you have to go through this.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Mom's always trying to hold me back!</p>
<p>I know, I know.</p>
<p>I can't be her little girl forever.</p>
<p>That must be really hard for you.</p>
<p>It is!</p>
<p>I'm so sorry you have to go through this.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>That listening-to-women junk you taught me really works.</p>
<p>The trick is in the nodding.</p>
<p>Dad, after seeing Mom and Lisa go at it, I'm glad our relationship is about physical abuse, not psychological.</p>
<p>Me, too, boy.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>This press conference was originally scheduled to introduce our ten Mars mission finalists.</p>
<p>However, our rivals at Space Colony One, a division of Pepperidge Farms, just announced that their Mars rocket is nearing completion.</p>
<p>We made a solemn promise to Fig Glutens that they would be the first cookie on Mars.</p>
<p>Therefore, we have moved up our launch date from 2026 to...</p>
<p>Thursday.</p>
<p>(gasping)</p>
<p>Thursday?</p>
<p><em>This</em> Thursday?</p>
<p>Are you all ready to be a part of history?</p>
<p>I wanted to be someone who's bravely going to Mars eventually.</p>
<p>I haven't used my Open Table dining points!</p>
<p>I'm still very much an alcoholic.</p>
<p>Uh, I-I guess we should leave, too.</p>
<p>I knew it!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>This has all been an elaborate charade.</p>
<p>You never had the guts to go to Mars.</p>
<p>Oh, I have the guts.</p>
<p>I once went to a rock concert by myself in the rain.</p>
<p>It was Loverboy.</p>
<p>Then let's go. To Mars.</p>
<p>Yeah, let's go!</p>
<p>To Mars.</p>
<p>Hmph. Hmph.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, mankind's first residents of Mars, powered by Simmer-Time Dinner Sauces.</p>
<p>Dinner time is Simmer-Time. For sauce.</p>
<p>(cheering)</p>
<p>They're leaving in a week?</p>
<p>Mom's my only good parent.</p>
<p>And Lisa's my only good kid!</p>
<p>Why won't they admit that neither of them actually wants to go to Mars?</p>
<p>I'm not giving up yet.</p>
<p>There's got to be a limit to their stubbornness, right?</p>
<p><strong>Flight director</strong>: T-minus one minute to launch.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: D'oh!</p>
<p>Here we go! I guess.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>We're doing this, apparently.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I doubted you, Mom.</p>
<p>There's no one I would rather go to Mars with.</p>
<p>I love you, sweetie.</p>
<p>I love you, too.</p>
<p>I don't want to go!</p>
<p>This is the stupidest idea we ever had!</p>
<p>Abort launch!</p>
<p>That's a negative.</p>
<p>I think you're forgetting the motto of Blue Bronco:</p>
<p>&quot;Let's do this thing.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Flight director</strong>: Twelve...</p>
<p><em>eleven...</em></p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: <em>This is not happening.</em></p>
<p>Do you know how to run the dishwasher?</p>
<p>Of course not!</p>
<p>Maybe we can use paper plates!</p>
<p>Where the hell do we get those?</p>
<p>Mom, no!</p>
<p>Marge, no!</p>
<p><strong>Flight director</strong>: ...three... two... one...</p>
<p>Ignition!</p>
<p>It's not a real rocket.</p>
<p>It's the outside of a real rocket.</p>
<p>We did plan to build a real rocket.</p>
<p>And that's one thing they can never take away from us.</p>
<p>That plan is our legacy.</p>
<p>Then why did you move up the launch if you knew it was fake?</p>
<p>To inspire the next generation.</p>
<p>And to provide a distraction while we drove away.</p>
<p>Then why are you still here?</p>
<p>Our car wouldn't start.</p>
<p>Mom, doesn't it frighten you that we almost went to Mars out of sheer stubbornness?</p>
<p>That's what a mother-daughter relationship is, sweetie.</p>
<p>A series of near-fatal emotional standoffs.</p>
<p>Okay, but it doesn't have to be that way.</p>
<p>Surely we can learn from this.</p>
<p>One day, we'll figure it out.</p>
<p>On this planet or another.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>(chickens clucking)</p>
<p>It's my life!</p>
<p>If I want to leave Mars and move to Venus, you can't stop me!</p>
<p>(annoyed grunt)</p>
<p>Mom's always trying to hold me back.</p>
<p>I know, I know.</p>
<p>I can't be her little girl forever.</p>
<p>That must be really hard for you.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>Nod-Bot is so sorry you have to go through this.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Barry</strong>: <em>Well, that's one for the win column.</em></p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: <em>I can't wait to find out what we're gonna do next.</em></p>
<p><strong>Barry</strong>: <em>We should fix racism.</em></p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: <em>Racism is bad for business.</em></p>
<p><strong>Barry</strong>: <em>And that is racism's fatal flaw.</em></p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: <em>I'm thinking of an app that would use the best algorithms in the world.</em></p>
<p><strong>Barry</strong>: <em>Algorithms like that would be great for this idea I've been back-burnering.</p>
<p>It's an ad-supported restaurant.</p>
<p>You get free food, but you have to watch ads.</p>
<p>If you want a hamburger, you watch five ads.</p>
<p>Tater Tots are, like, three ads.</p>
<p>Have you tried these things?</em></p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: <em>I've heard about them, actually, I didn't actually...</em></p>
<p><strong>Barry</strong>: <em>They're good. They're really good.</em></p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: <em>I love everything you just said, but what if it was a barbershop?</em></p>
<p><strong>Barry</strong>: <em>Might be a good idea... if you're interested in changing the world!</em></p>
<p>Shh!</p>
