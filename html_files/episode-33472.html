<p> - Mmm.</p>
<p> Jam.</p>
<p> - [PRINTER BEEPING]</p>
<p> [YAWNS, LAUGHS]</p>
<p> [FOOTSTEP SPLASHES]</p>
<p> Okay, okay.</p>
<p> The only explanation is I'm still asleep, dreaming that the house is flooded.</p>
<p> What does it mean?</p>
<p> What does it mean?</p>
<p> It probably means you're under a lot of stress because this is not a dream and the house is flooded.</p>
<p> - D'oh!</p>
<p> - Cowabunga!</p>
<p> [MARGE HUMMING]</p>
<p> [GASPS]</p>
<p> MARGE: Oh, my God.</p>
<p> This is horrible!</p>
<p> Although, I do like the sofa better where the water's carrying it.</p>
<p> How did this happen?</p>
<p> Homie, I don't like where the painting is.</p>
<p> Maybe you're upset about something else.</p>
<p> Are you hungry?</p>
<p> Why don't you make some pork chops?</p>
<p> Fine.</p>
<p> Now can you hang the painting?</p>
<p> Always with the painting.</p>
<p> MARGE: Perfect.</p>
<p> Wait, no, no, it's not.</p>
<p> Try again.</p>
<p> Mm.</p>
<p> No, split the difference.</p>
<p> See?</p>
<p> When you listen to me, we make a great team.</p>
<p> It's almost like I can hear the ocean.</p>
<p> I guess we're both at fault.</p>
<p> In a way, that's refreshing.</p>
<p> Do you want me to apologize anyway?</p>
<p> - I'd be happy to.</p>
<p> - Aw, no, thanks, sweetie.</p>
<p> HOMER: Hmm.</p>
<p> Well, either way, I'm sorry.</p>
<p> Okay, now, when we try to sell the house, no one mention the water.</p>
<p> Just tell me you paid the insurance.</p>
<p> You mean that bill that's floating right there?</p>
<p> [LAUGHS]</p>
<p> It's not due till tomorrow, so relax.</p>
<p> My origami project.</p>
<p> Don't worry, sweetie.</p>
<p> We'll have a funeral for it.</p>
<p> GIL: All right.</p>
<p> I-I'll just pull up your policy.</p>
<p> Alt-Control-F Aw, damn it!</p>
<p> Kate!</p>
<p> Kate, can you get in here?</p>
<p> It's a different generation that knows how to work these things.</p>
<p> - Enjoy.</p>
<p> - Eh, the kids, huh?</p>
<p> They just know how to do it.</p>
<p> Now let's see here.</p>
<p> [MURMURS QUIETLY]</p>
<p> You're in luck!</p>
<p> The policy I sold you covers the full replacement value of your house.</p>
<p> [HOMER WHOOPS]</p>
<p> We also pay for six months temporary housing.</p>
<p> Now the bad news: your policy is the only one I've sold.</p>
<p> It just cost the company a bundle, and I'm gonna lose my job.</p>
<p> Gee, sorry, ol' Gil.</p>
<p> That's okay, I got options: unemployment, su1c1de.</p>
<p> When one door closes, a coffin opens.</p>
<p> Eh, what am I saying?</p>
<p> I don't make coffin money.</p>
<p> But now I got something to work towards!</p>
<p> That's right.</p>
<p> Kate, can you tell me how to charge a cell phone?</p>
<p> Whoa, whoa, whoa, so wall holes make things charge?</p>
<p> [LAUGHS]</p>
<p> What's next?</p>
<p> There are some nice Airbnb options on the Westside.</p>
<p> Ooh.</p>
<p> Huh?</p>
<p> Huh?</p>
<p> Mm, I'd feel kind of weird sleeping in the bedroom of someone I know.</p>
<p> Everything okay with the room?</p>
<p> [SHOUTS]</p>
<p> You're not supposed to be back from your vacation for three weeks.</p>
<p> It's not a vacation.</p>
<p> My dad is doing seasonal fruit picking.</p>
<p> Come on, Milhouse.</p>
<p> I need you on my shoulders to reach the high apples.</p>
<p> And I don't want to be in a room where guys walked around with their dinguses out.</p>
<p> No!</p>
<p> No, don't imagine that!</p>
<p> So, son, uh, word on the street is you've come into some money.</p>
<p> Yeah?</p>
<p> I was wondering, you know, uh just hear me out I've always considered you a friend, and Oh, no.</p>
<p> No, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p> This is the most precious kind of money there is: unearned, and it's mine.</p>
<p> And you're not getting at it just because you need a bigger TV or a room with a window or An operation.</p>
<p> You need an operation?</p>
<p> What's the matter?</p>
<p> If it's all the same, it's embarrassing, and I'd rather not discuss it publicly.</p>
<p> Really?</p>
<p> What could it be?</p>
<p> Look, it's important to me and pricey.</p>
<p> What could it be?</p>
<p> &quot;Pane in the ass&quot;?</p>
<p> [BUZZING]</p>
<p> [IMITATES BUZZER]</p>
<p> Hands off!</p>
<p> I need professional help!</p>
<p> Not to worry.</p>
<p> This is the United States.</p>
<p> We have the third best health care system in North America.</p>
<p> Hi, Medicare!</p>
<p> I mean, hi, every-money.</p>
<p> Can I speak with the doctor alone?</p>
<p> Of course.</p>
<p> Oh, wait, I'm the doctor.</p>
<p> That's why I wear the heart listening tube.</p>
<p> Ba-boom, ba-boom.</p>
<p> That never gets old.</p>
<p> What's taking Grampa so long in there?</p>
<p> It's crazy that medical costs are so high here.</p>
<p> In Denmark to pick a country at random health care is free.</p>
<p> Free?</p>
<p> Honey, nothing is free but Splendas.</p>
<p> In Denmark, they make everyone pay high taxes.</p>
<p> Even rich people.</p>
<p> Yes, and they get free health care.</p>
<p> It's called socialism.</p>
<p> Socialism?</p>
<p> But all my radio loudmouths tell me to hate that.</p>
<p> That doc can't do nothing for me.</p>
<p> You know, if Grampa was in Denmark and he had an accident, he'd get medical care for free!</p>
<p> I can't go to Denmark by myself.</p>
<p> I get lost in the middle of a sentence, and that was the best pie I ever had.</p>
<p> Wait a minute.</p>
<p> What if we used our insurance money to take a family trip to Denmark?</p>
<p> Why would we want to go to Denmark?</p>
<p> It is the happiest country on Earth, in poll after poll.</p>
<p> I got your poll right here.</p>
<p> Hey, you're right.</p>
<p> Homer, you've got the vacation coming.</p>
<p> We've got the money.</p>
<p> It's settled.</p>
<p> We're going to Denmark, and Grampa will get fixed.</p>
<p> Well, Homer, looks like Marge is the boss in your house.</p>
<p> Well, I say we don't go!</p>
<p> But we need to go.</p>
<p> I'm desperate!</p>
<p> Fine, we'll go.</p>
<p> [LAUGHS]</p>
<p> That woman's got you right under her thumb.</p>
<p> DANISH MAN: None of these were chosen as the name of our airline.</p>
<p> Danish Air.</p>
<p> Excuse me, sir, the &quot;no smoking&quot; sign has been illuminated.</p>
<p> [ELECTRONIC CHIMING]</p>
<p> Sorry.</p>
<p> The flight attendants are so sweet.</p>
<p> We will be landing in Copenhagen shortly.</p>
<p> If you have been designing and building furniture during the flight, please apply your final coat of varnish now.</p>
<p> Hey, I got things done, too.</p>
<p> GRAMPA: What the?!</p>
<p> SOREN: Denmark, the jewel of the Baltic.</p>
<p> First-class schools, sleek furniture design, energy independence, and brooding TV dramas about teenagers getting k*ll.</p>
<p> Thank you so much for renting my apartment.</p>
<p> It's so efficient.</p>
<p> Please allow me to give you a tour of Copenhagen.</p>
<p> Wonderful.</p>
<p> But first, a nap.</p>
<p> No, Homer.</p>
<p> You slept on the plane.</p>
<p> You slept through customs.</p>
<p> You slept on the bus.</p>
<p> How can you sleep now?</p>
<p> Don't you hear Copenhagen calling?</p>
<p> Take a message.</p>
<p> The people here are so openly affectionate.</p>
<p> Why don't we all hold hands?</p>
<p> Are we supposed to interlock fingers or not?</p>
<p> Cramp!</p>
<p> Cramp!</p>
<p> Dad's hands are covered with jam.</p>
<p> - I can't get it off!</p>
<p> - Grampa's hands are too rough.</p>
<p> - Lisa's hands are too soft.</p>
<p> - Just keep holding.</p>
<p> Oh, don't worry, the government will pay you to learn this social k*ll.</p>
<p> Uh, Homer, you are holding your own hand.</p>
<p> They're fighting over a Danish.</p>
<p> SOREN: Created in 1913, The Little Mermaid is a world-famous icon of Denmark.</p>
<p> No, The Little Mermaid was created by Disney, right before he created Spider-Man and Star Wars.</p>
<p> This is the real little mermaid.</p>
<p> And she was a very tragic figure.</p>
<p> - What about her buddy, the crab?</p>
<p> - There was no crab!</p>
<p> He was the only funny thing in it.</p>
<p> Got that right.</p>
<p> Oh, my God, it's wonderful.</p>
<p> More people biking than driving cars.</p>
<p> Yes, it's rush hour, so people are taking the bicycle superhighways home.</p>
<p> Uh, how crowded are your bicycle superhighways?</p>
<p> [CHUCKLES]: Well We don't have any.</p>
<p> But how many people ride bikes in your town?</p>
<p> The paperboy, till Dad hit him.</p>
<p> Sadly, the one headline he couldn't deliver.</p>
<p> Wait a minute, wait a minute, stop the car!</p>
<p> [HOMER AND BART LAUGH]</p>
<p> What?</p>
<p> It's Danish for &quot;speed check. &quot; </p>
<p> - Fart kontrol.</p>
<p> - [HOMER AND BART LAUGHING]</p>
<p> [BLOWS RASPBERRIES]</p>
<p> [GIGGLES]</p>
<p> I apologize for my husband.</p>
<p> In our language, that sign means something else.</p>
<p> Yes, I know.</p>
<p> I'm speaking to you in your language.</p>
<p> &quot;Non-Danes do not qualify for the free health care.</p>
<p> &quot;But if you injure yourself in Denmark, a Danish hospital will treat you for free.</p>
<p> &quot; [CHUCKLES]</p>
<p> I can't believe the government puts this out.</p>
<p> For free!</p>
<p> [HOMER AND GRAMPA LAUGH]</p>
<p> Excuse me, you dropped this.</p>
<p> Lisa, this is Prince Christian, second in line to the throne.</p>
<p> I play the tenor sax.</p>
<p> Oh, no, here it comes.</p>
<p> The fantasy about becoming a princess that no girl can resist.</p>
<p> [TRUMPETS PLAYING FANFARE]</p>
<p> [DRAMATIC SOUNDTRACK MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
<p> Bart, get out of my fantasy!</p>
<p> Ah, geez, I saved your life.</p>
<p> How about a &quot;you're welcome&quot;?</p>
<p> Can you imagine how exciting it would be to live in this city?</p>
<p> Ooh, Mom, we could try it for a semester.</p>
<p> Do you know how long I've wanted to live in a Celsius country?</p>
<p> There's boobs on the billboards!</p>
<p> And we're here in the world's most perfect amusement park.</p>
<p> [FIREWORKS WHISTLING, POPPING]</p>
<p> [BOTH GASP]</p>
<p> [CHOIR SINGING IN DANISH]</p>
<p> Their national anthem is so beautiful, and they don't get to w*r until the second verse.</p>
<p> And it's in a range you can actually sing.</p>
<p> There is a lovely land With spreading shady beech-trees Near salty eastern shore Near salty eastern shore.</p>
<p> Bart and Lisa are getting along!</p>
<p> This country is calling to us.</p>
<p> Homer, can you take the daring step of doing nothing and staying here?</p>
<p> There are big reasons why we can't live here.</p>
<p> I'm okay with nuclear power, but wind power?</p>
<p> - Frankly, it sounds dangerous.</p>
<p> - Excuse me, white trash.</p>
<p> Is this the kind of country you want to live in?</p>
<p> No, sir.</p>
<p> I meant we separate our trash by colors.</p>
<p> This country is still lovely Because blue is the lake wind I can't believe you're talking about leaving Springfield.</p>
<p> That's where all my friends are.</p>
<p> Look, everyone, we came here to rip this country off, and that's what we're gonna do and then go home.</p>
<p> Fine.</p>
<p> Let's find a place that has good smorrebrod, or maybe some morbradbof or flaeskesteg.</p>
<p> Women do love this country.</p>
<p> Homer, do you think I'm handsome?</p>
<p> Well, yes.</p>
<p> I was gonna mention it.</p>
<p> - I am a Danish four.</p>
<p> - I'm an American nine.</p>
<p> [&quot;AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL&quot; PLAYING]</p>
<p> How could my family want to stay here?</p>
<p> In America, we have great TV channels, like BBC America, and a factory for cheesecakes a factory!</p>
<p> Your enthusiasm makes me want to follow you there.</p>
<p> Foreigners are no longer welcome.</p>
<p> All right, Dad, no more fooling around.</p>
<p> Time to get you in the hospital, so we can go home.</p>
<p> Hello.</p>
<p> How was your day?</p>
<p> Eh.</p>
<p> This country sure is safe.</p>
<p> Well, last week, an older tourist had a bad fall at Kronborg Castle.</p>
<p> Of course, Kronborg Castle.</p>
<p> Why didn't I think of it?</p>
<p> Probably because I never heard of it.</p>
<p> TOUR GUIDE: Dating back to the 15th century, Kronborg was immortalized as Elsinore in Shakespeare's Hamlet.</p>
<p> Isn't it beautiful?</p>
<p> Yeah, the castle's okay, but the keep is, like, meh.</p>
<p> And I'll tell you something else great about here.</p>
<p> You've been walking so much, you've lost weight.</p>
<p> [GASPS]</p>
<p> I'm down to my pre-pregnancy weight!</p>
<p> Homer, in this most beautiful spot on Earth, I have to admit to you, I really don't want to go home.</p>
<p> - I don't either.</p>
<p> - Let's stay.</p>

<p> Think about how happy we'd be here.</p>
<p> It's healthy, it's clean, it's incredibly civilized, and everything is done in moderation.</p>
<p> You're not describing a country.</p>
<p> You're describing everything that's the opposite of me.</p>
<p> Everyone here speaks perfect English.</p>
<p> Probably gonna be around in five years.</p>
<p> It's just a nice place and we like it.</p>
<p> All I ask is that you think about it.</p>
<p> Maybe she's right.</p>
<p> Maybe we should move here.</p>
<p> Tubby or not tubby, that is the question.</p>
<p> Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to gobble the wings and nachos of outrageous portions, or just eat fish and end them.</p>
<p> Ay, there's the rub brisket rub, Memphis rub.</p>
<p> Oh, the rubs I'll miss when I have shuffled off from Buffalo.</p>
<p> Mozzarella No.</p>
<p> I'm an American, and we've got to get back to America, the greatest country on Earth, 1917 to 2016.</p>
<p> This is the famous Holger Danish, our sleeping king.</p>
<p> All right, Dad, here we go.</p>
<p> There's nothing more American than a slip and fall.</p>
<p> - [GRUNTS]</p>
<p> - Whoa!</p>
<p> Hold on, son.</p>
<p> Before you push me down these stairs, I have a confession.</p>
<p> The procedure I need isn't a surgery.</p>
<p> I just need to remove an old tattoo.</p>
<p> You made us come here because of a stupid tattoo?</p>
<p> It's not just any tattoo.</p>
<p> [GASPS]</p>
<p> Mom?</p>
<p> No!</p>
<p> Mona Malloy, who used to iron my shirts.</p>
<p> Of course it's your mother.</p>
<p> I can't go to my grave with this hanging over my heart.</p>
<p> Why is it guys like us are always disappointing the women we love?</p>
<p> I would ask Mona, but she's spending eternity hating me, from her pit in hell.</p>
<p> I miss her, too.</p>
<p> Her greatest k*ll was making people miss her.</p>
<p> [SOBBING]</p>
<p> - Hello.</p>
<p> - She's talking to you.</p>
<p> Mm, I'll talk to someone my age.</p>
<p> [CHUCKLES]</p>
<p> Excuse me.</p>
<p> I felt compelled to meet you.</p>
<p> I've never met a man with empathy so deep he weeps in public.</p>
<p> Oh, yeah, I cry, I blubber.</p>
<p> Sometimes stuff comes out of my nose.</p>
<p> Well [SIGHS]</p>
<p> Danish men never reveal such emotion.</p>
<p> They're like cold, flawless gods.</p>
<p> Look, lady, I'm a married man.</p>
<p> - I'm a married man.</p>
<p> - Shh.</p>
<p> [MUFFLED]: I'm a married man.</p>
<p> Here, marriage is not such a sacred institution.</p>
<p> Danes are very free sexually.</p>
<p> Perhaps it's because we are more sensitive to each other's needs, or just because we're all so freaking hot.</p>
<p> Now let us dance our traditional dance of passion.</p>
<p> Okay.</p>
<p> - [LIVELY DANISH MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
<p> - [EXCITED SHOUTING]</p>
<p> Do you know the Danes eat more ice cream than any other people?</p>
<p> Yet their rate of heart disease is Oh, it's their number one cause of death.</p>
<p> Well, look where we got it.</p>
<p> Well, that never stopped your father.</p>
<p> I'll just text a picture of you right now, eating the ice Oh, my God.</p>
<p> [GASPS]</p>
<p> Marge.</p>
<p> Where are you going?</p>
<p> Where will I ever find another man like you?</p>
<p> Hi, we're the Kiwanis Club of Cheeseburg, Ohio.</p>
<p> [SIGHS]: Oh hio.</p>
<p> I must confess to you now, every couple that has Airbnb'd my apartment has broken up.</p>
<p> Then how did it get so many good reviews?</p>
<p> They like the big apartment cat.</p>
<p> Oh, I do like it.</p>
<p> Ooh, let me scratch your chin!</p>
<p> [PURRING]</p>
<p> He's so chubby, I just can't take it!</p>
<p> Marge, honey, I'm so sorry.</p>
<p> We shared a dance and a fish, but that's it.</p>
<p> - I understand.</p>
<p> It's fine.</p>
<p> - So you're coming home?</p>
<p> No, I'm not.</p>
<p> I want to stay.</p>
<p> I don't know for how long, but I feel so alive and free.</p>
<p> I've stopped wearing a bra.</p>
<p> [GASPS]</p>
<p> That means they're just one fabric away from the cool Scandinavian air.</p>
<p> Sorry, Homie.</p>
<p> We're not leaving.</p>
<p> Well, the kids can't just replace me.</p>
<p> He's so cozy.</p>
<p> He can sleep with Mom.</p>
<p> Can I get you a beer?</p>
<p> [PURRING]</p>
<p> [HOMER GROANS]</p>
<p> - Dad, wait.</p>
<p> - [GASPS]</p>
<p> Mom says you can take these home with you.</p>
<p> It's a bag of bras.</p>
<p> And I just learned how to unhook these.</p>
<p> Oh, my God.</p>
<p> What am I doing?</p>
<p> I should be having the time of my life in this airport security line, but it's nothing without Marge.</p>
<p> Son, I got to tell you something.</p>
<p> - You're making a huge mistake.</p>
<p> - I know.</p>
<p> I let stubbornness ruin my marriage, and all I have to show for it is an old tattoo.</p>
<p> - Go back to your woman.</p>
<p> - You mean the one in the bar?</p>
<p> First the one in the bar, then Marge.</p>
<p> No!</p>
<p> Just Marge.</p>
<p> - Marge!</p>
<p> - [GASPS]</p>
<p> You missed the flight.</p>
<p> Marge, baby, wherever you are is home.</p>
<p> I'm staying in Copenhagen.</p>
<p> I'm glad you came back, but I was kind of rethinking living here.</p>
<p> Why?</p>
<p> The toilet's in the shower.</p>
<p> The washing machine won't even hold one pair of your underpants.</p>
<p> And you see how dark it is?</p>
<p> It's 11:00 in the morning.</p>
<p> [YAWNS]</p>
<p> Well, that was a nice day.</p>
<p> I think I'm ready to go home.</p>
<p> You got it, baby.</p>
<p> We'll ditch this paradise and never come back.</p>
<p> What about the kids?</p>
<p> I heard the schools are really great here.</p>
<p> I'm out.</p>
<p> I want to stay, but no one ever listens to me.</p>
<p> So we're all united.</p>
<p> - Yay!</p>
<p> - Whoo!</p>
<p> But I can't help thinking I'm forgetting something.</p>
<p> Sir, those birds were already fed by the state.</p>
<p> You are overfeeding them, which will k*ll them.</p>
<p> [GRAMPA GRUNTS]</p>
<p> When life gives you lemons, you make lemonade.</p>
<p> ALL: Aw.</p>
<p> So how much do we owe you?</p>
<p> Nothing.</p>
<p> In Denmark, we have socialized tattooing.</p>
<p> And with that, our country is out of money.</p>
<p> Good-bye.</p>
<p> [PANTING]</p>
