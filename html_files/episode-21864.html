							<p>FADE IN:</p>
<p>Outside sh*t of the house.  Bart and Lisa are heard.</p>
<p>BART: Yeah? </p>
<p>LISA: Yeah. </p>
<p>BART: Oh, yeah!</p>
<p>LISA: Yeah!</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>INSIDE...they are pushing each other around.</p>
<p>BART: Yeah?  Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>LISA: Yeah.</p>
<p>Homer runs in a red-striped shirt.  He picks each one of them up with one hand.</p>
<p>HOMER: Hey, what's the problem here?</p>
<p>LISA: We were fighting over which one of us loves you more.</p>
<p>HOMER: You were? (sniffles).  Aw...well, go ahead. </p>
<p>He drops them to the ground.</p>
<p>BART: You love him more.</p>
<p>LISA: No, you do.</p>
<p>BART: No, I don't.</p>
<p>LISA: Yes, you do!</p>
<p>BART:  No, I don't!</p>
<p>HOMER: Look, you better get this all out of your system right now!  I don't want you embarrassing me at my boss's picnic.</p>
<p>Homer walks by a big piece of gelatin.</p>
<p>HOMER: Mmm.  Marshmallow.</p>
<p>He takes a green marshmallow out, eats it, and burps.</p>
<p>MARGE: Homer!</p>
<p>She stands in the doorway to the kitchen.</p>
<p>HOMER: I'm trying to get at least some of the unfortunate voices out of my system while I can, Marge.  I don't want to embarrass myself at the company picnic.</p>
<p>She grunts.</p>
<p>HOMER: Are you sure that's enough?  You know how the boss loves your delicious gelatin desserts.</p>
<p>MARGE: Oh, Homer, Mr. Burns just said he liked it...once.</p>
<p>HOMER: Marge, that's the only time he's ever spoken to me without using the word &quot;bonehead&quot;.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>The whole family drives in the pink car.  Every member (including Maggie) has a plate of gelatin on their lap.</p>
<p>HOMER: There it is, kids.  Stately Burns Manor.  Heaven on Earth.</p>
<p>The camera pans in on the gigantic house.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>The family walks up a hill, most of them carrying the gelatin above their head.</p>
<p>HOMER: Okay, now look, my boss is gonna be at this picnic so I want you to show your father some love and/or respect.</p>
<p>LISA: Tough choice.</p>
<p>BART: I'm picking respect.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>Inside the manor, Burns and Smithers greet visitors.</p>
<p>BURNS: Good to see you.  Glad you could make it.</p>
<p>MAN: Oh, thank you, Mr. Burns.  I'm so glad you invited us.</p>
<p>MAN'S KID: Not me.  I had to miss little league for this.</p>
<p>MAN: Quiet, Tom.</p>
<p>BURNS: Oh please please don't fight.  Just go out back and have a good time.</p>
<p>After they walk by---</p>
<p>BURNS: Fire that man, Smithers.  I don't want him or his unpleasant family to ruin my picnic.</p>
<p>SMITHERS: He'll be gone by the tug-of-war, sir.</p>
<p>BURNS: Excellent.</p>
<p>HOMER: Uh, afternoon, Mr. Burns.</p>
<p>BURNS: Ah, hello there, uh-- uh---</p>
<p>HOMER (to Smithers): Simpson, Homer.</p>
<p>SMITHERS: Here you go, sir.</p>
<p>He hands Burns a sheet.</p>
<p>BURNS: Ah!  Oh, yes.  Uh, oh, and this must be your lovely wife, Marge.</p>
<p>He looks at the paper.  It gives all the names and their role in the family.</p>
<p>BURNS: Oh, and look at little, uh, Lisa.  Why, she's growing like a weed.  And this must be...Brat.</p>
<p>BART: Bart.</p>
<p>HOMER: Don't correct the man, Brat.  Oh, boss, look what we bought -- gelatin desserts!</p>
<p>BURNS: Oh, for the love of Peter, that's all anybody brought.  Some damn fool went around telling everyone I love that slimy goop.  Well, toss it in the pile over there.</p>
<p>He points to several tables covered only in gelatin desserts.</p>
<p>BURNS: And make yourselves at home.</p>
<p>BART: Hear that, Dad?  You can lie around in your underwear and scratch yourself.</p>
<p>HOMER: Now you listen to me---!</p>
<p>BURNS: Trouble, Simpson?</p>
<p>HOMER: No (chuckles).  Just congrutaling the son on a fine joke about his old man.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<p>Burn's backyard, where a group of kids play.  On a balcony, the family gathers.</p>
<p>HOMER: Now remember, as far as anyone knows, we're a nice, normal family.</p>
<p>LISA: Hey, Bart, last one in the fountain's a rotten egg!</p>
<p>BART: Hey!</p>
<p>HOMER: D-oh!  Be normal.  Be normal.</p>
<p>He chases after them.</p>
<p>A mom and her baby comes alongside Marge.</p>
<p>MARGE: What an adorable little girl.</p>
<p>MOM: (chuckles).  Thank you.  Why don't we dump them in the nursery and get a glass of punch?</p>
<p>MARGE: Oh, I'm not much of a drinker.</p>
<p>MOM: Hey, isn't that your boy there torturing the swans?</p>
<p>Lisa hides in the fountain as Homer chases after Bart.</p>
<p>MARGE: Oh.  Maybe I will take you up on that punch.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<p>Marge and the mom enter the nursery.</p>
<p>MARGE: Gee, do you think we should leave the kids unsupervised?</p>
<p>MOM: You're right.</p>
<p>She places her baby down.</p>
<p>MOM: There.</p>
<p>She turns on the TV to a children's show.  All the children's attention is instantly captured.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>Homer runs by the fountain.</p>
<p>HOMER: Bart!  Lisa!</p>
<p>A group of swans run past him.  He mumbles as Lisa poses as a water-spitting statue.</p>
<p>HOMER: Where are you kids?  D-oh!</p>
<p>BART: Whoops!</p>
<p>HOMER: Got ya!</p>
<p>BART: Careful, Dad.  Blow a gasket, you lose your job.</p>
<p>SMITHERS: Now hear this: The father/son sackrace will begin in five minutes on the north lawn.  Participation is mandatory.  Repeat, mandatory.  That is all.</p>
<p>HOMER: You remember the rules from last year?</p>
<p>BART: Yeah, shut my mouth, and let your boss win.</p>
<p>As they win, a swan croaks at them.</p>
<p>BART: Hey!</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>A group of Moms talk.</p>
<p>MOM 2: i don't know who to love more: my son, Joshua, who's captain of the football team or my daughter, Amber, who got the lead in the school play.</p>
<p>Behind her, Marge is slightly drunk as she pours himself another glass of punch.</p>
<p>MOM 2: Usually, I use their grades as a tiebreaker, but they both got straight A's this term so what's a mother to do?</p>
<p>MARGE: Mm-hmm.  Well, I sense greatness in your family.</p>
<p>MOM: Your family?</p>
<p>MARGE: Well, it's a greatness that others can't see, but it's there.  And if it's not true greatness we have, we're at least average.</p>
<p>She sips some more.</p>
<p>MARGE: I don't want to alarm anyone but I think there's a little &quot;al-kee-hol&quot; in this punch.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>A green lawn, where fathers and son prepare for the sack race.</p>
<p>SMITHERS: Mr. Burns, are you ready?</p>
<p>BURNS: Yes.</p>
<p>SMITHERS: Are you set?</p>
<p>BURNS: Yes.</p>
<p>SMITHERS: Go, Mr. Burns.</p>
<p>Mr. Burns begins inching ahead as the crowd cheers.  Seconds laters, Smithers fires a g*n and they're all off.</p>
<p>First, Burns takes a leap and then the others follow him.  Clearly, everybody wants him to win.</p>
<p>BART: Man, this is pathetic.  I'm goin' for it!</p>
<p>He leaps past Burns.</p>
<p>HOMER: Bart!  No!  No!  No!  No!!</p>
<p>He follows Bart.</p>
<p>HOMER: Oh, no, wait.  Oh, no.  Bart, don't!  Bart, no!  Noo!</p>
<p>He leaps and lands on Bart.  He holds him down until Burns crosses the finish line.</p>
<p>BURNS: Close one this year.</p>
<p>Bart and Homer stare angrily at each other.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>Back to Marge and the ladies.  She pours herself cup and sings.</p>
<p>MARGE: Here we sit enjoying the shade.</p>
<p>LADIES: Hey, brother, pour on the wine.</p>
<p>MARGE: Drink the drink that I have made.</p>
<p>LADIES: Hey, brother, pour on the wine.</p>
<p>Bart and Homer come into view.</p>
<p>MARGE:</p>
<p>He's here at last, my one and only<br />
Goodbye, friends and don't be lonely<br />
LADIES: Hey, brother, pour on the wine.</p>
<p>Homer groans.</p>
<p>HOMER: Marge, I need you!</p>
<p>MARGE: Hey, Homie, did you try the punch?</p>
<p>Marge slips off the table and falls into Homer's arms.</p>
<p>HOMER: Snap out of it, Marge.  You've gotta come with me.  The boss is going to make a toast.</p>
<p>MARGE: Well, I'm not much of a drinker.</p>
<p>HOMER: Why, you picked the perfect time to start.  (grumbles).</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>A sh*t of the entire crowd.  A band plays  &quot;For He's a Jolly Good Fellow&quot; in the background.</p>
<p>BURNS: Musicians, cease that infernal tootling.</p>
<p>They stop.  Smithers hands Burns an index card.</p>
<p>BURNS: Thank you all...</p>
<p>He's quickly handed another card.</p>
<p>BURNS: Uh, for coming!</p>
<p>Everybody claps for several seconds.  Marge continues to clap after the crowd has quieted.</p>
<p>HOMER: Marge, knock it off.</p>
<p>MARGE: Well, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>HOMER: Marge.</p>
<p>BURNS: But now it's time to say goodbye.  Please get off my property until next year.  I suggest you don't dawdle.  The hounds will be released in ten minutes.</p>
<p>Everybody claps.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>The main hall, where everyone makes their way out of the front door.</p>
<p>FATHER: Did you have a good time, son?</p>
<p>SON: Yeah, thanks, Pop.</p>
<p>The son kisses his father as they walk by Burns.</p>
<p>BURNS: Aww, that's the kind of family unity I like to see. Smithers?</p>
<p>SMITHERS: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>BURNS: Get that man's name.  I predict big things for him down at the power plant.</p>
<p>Several inches away, Homer overhears the conversation.  He turns down to Bart.</p>
<p>HOMER: Quick, Bart, give me a kiss.</p>
<p>BART: Kiss you?  But, Dad, I'm your kid.</p>
<p>HOMER: Bart, please.  Five bucks for a kiss.</p>
<p>He shows him a dollar bill.  Bart kisses him.  Homer smiles at Burns.</p>
<p>BURNS: Ugh, I have never seen such an obvious attempt to curry my favor.</p>
<p>SMITHERS: Fabulous observation, sir.  Just fabulous.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>Outside, the Simpsons walk.  It is close to night time.</p>
<p>HOMER: Boy, I'm glad that's over.  Now we can go home and act normal again.</p>
<p>FATHER #2: What do you mean?</p>
<p>HOMER: Aw come on.  (does several fake kisses).  That cornball routine?  I love you, Daddy.  Give me a break.</p>
<p>FATHER #2: I pity you.</p>
<p>HOMER: Why?</p>
<p>LITTLE CHILD: After you.</p>
<p>He opens the car door.  His sister climbs in.</p>
<p>SISTER: Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Homer looks to his own kids, who are fighting to get into the car.</p>
<p>BART: Me first.  No, me.  Me me.</p>
<p>LISA: No, me.  No, me.  Me.  Me.</p>
<p>FATHER 2'S WIFE: Honey, you look so tired.  Would you like me to drive?</p>
<p>Back to Homer's family.</p>
<p>MARGE: Oh, Homie, I think I'm gonna be sick.</p>
<p>OTHER FAMILY: There was a farmer who had a dog and Bingo was his name Oh - B-I-N-G-O B-I-N-G-O B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name oh.</p>
<p>A ray of light shines down on the car.</p>
<p>MARGE: Homie, get in the car.</p>
<p>LISA: This is where you belong.</p>
<p>BART: Yeah, Homer.  Room for one more.</p>
<p>Homer's family has transformed into evil-looking zombies.</p>
<p>ALL: One of us!  One of us!  One of us!  One of us!</p>
<p>They all laugh as Homer drives on.  Everything around him is in flames.</p>
<p>On top, going up to Heaven, is the other family's car slowly flying up.</p>
<p>OTHER FAMILY: B-I-N-G-O.  B-I-N-G-O.  B-I-N-G-O.</p>
<p>Homer sighs.</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK</p>
<p>FADE IN</p>
<p>On the TV:</p>
<p>A film about birds.</p>
<p>ANNOUNCER: The father of the family has worked all day to find this food for his children.</p>
<p>Bart, Lisa, and Marge stare at the TV and eat as Homer walks in.</p>
<p>ANNOUNCER: Unable to feed for themselves, the baby bald eaglets are dependent on their mother, regurgitating the food which she has found.</p>
<p>Homer turns off the TV.</p>
<p>MARGE: Hom---</p>
<p>LISA: Hey!</p>
<p>HOMER: Look, everybody.  Yesterday was a real eye-opener.  We've got to do better as a family.  So tonight, we're not goind to shovel food in our mouths while we stare at the TV.  We're going to eat at the dining room table like a normal family.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>Everyone at the dining table.  Microwave dinners are in front of everyone.</p>
<p>LISA: Happy, Dad?</p>
<p>HOMER: Yes.</p>
<p>LISA: Good.  Commence shoveling.</p>
<p>They all stuff food into their mouths.</p>
<p>HOMER: No, we're going to say grace first.</p>
<p>BART: Okay.  Rub-a-dub-dub, thanks for the grub.</p>
<p>They continue stuffing.  Homer growls angrily.</p>
<p>HOMER: No!  Ignore the boy, Lord.  Now can the chatter and bow your heads.  (clears throat).  Dear Lord, thank you for this microwave bounty even though we don't deserve it.  I mean, our kids are uncontrollable hellions.  Pardon my French, but they act like savages.  Did you see them at the picnic?  Of course you did.  You're everywhere.  You're omnivirous.  O Lord, why did you smite me with this family?</p>
<p>ALL: Amen.</p>
<p>BART: Let's eat!</p>
<p>Stuffing...</p>
<p>HOMER: No, I'm not done yet!</p>
<p>MARGE: But Homer, how long are we supposed to sit here and listen to you bad mouth us to the Man Upstairs?</p>
<p>HOMER: I'm sorry, Marge, but sometimes I think we're the worst family in town.</p>
<p>MARGE: Maybe we should move to a larger community.</p>
<p>HOMER: D-oh!</p>
<p>BART: Don't have a cow, Dad.</p>
<p>LISA: The sad truth is all families are like us.</p>
<p>HOMER: You think so, huh?  Well, there's only one way to find out.  Follow me.</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK</p>
<p>FADE IN</p>
<p>A dark night.  The Simpsons crawl under a bush and stare into a window.</p>
<p>HOMER: Look at that, kids.  No fighting.  No yelling.</p>
<p>BART: No belching.</p>
<p>LISA: The dad has a shirt on.</p>
<p>MARGE: Look, napkins.</p>
<p>BART: These people are obviously freaks.</p>
<p>HOMER: Oh, you think so?  Well, let's see what's behind door number two.</p>
<p>LISA: What are they doing?</p>
<p>MARGE: They're having a conversation.  They actually enjoy talking to each other.</p>
<p>HOMER: I wish I could hear what's they're saying.</p>
<p>Inside the house...</p>
<p>BOY: Papa, I believe I heard some rustling in the bushes.</p>
<p>DAD: Hmm, I did too.  Better get the g*n.</p>
<p>Outside...</p>
<p>LISA: Where's he going?</p>
<p>HOMER: Probably to get the old man his pipe and slippers.</p>
<p>A g*n cocks.  To the right, the man fires.</p>
<p>The Simpsons run away and hide behind a brick wall.  Then they make their way to another window.</p>
<p>BART: Whoa, look at this place!  What a dump!</p>
<p>HOMER: It's worse than you think.  (chuckles).  I just trampled this poor sap's flower bed.</p>
<p>MARGE: Homer, this is our house.</p>
<p>HOMER: Ahhhh!</p>
<p>MARGE: Are you coming in, Homer?</p>
<p>HOMER: No, no.  I wanna be alone with my thought.</p>
<p>The door slams.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>Moe's bar.  A boxing match is on the TV.  MOE serves drinks.</p>
<p>BOXING ANNOUNCER: Fans are getting a bit anxious here.</p>
<p>HOMER: Another beer, Moe.</p>
<p>MOE: What's the matter, Homer?  Bloodiest fight of the year.  You're sitting there like a thirsty bump on a log. </p>
<p>Two POLICE OFFICERS walk in.</p>
<p>MOE: Eddie!</p>
<p>EDDIE: Evening, Moe.</p>
<p>MOE: Want some pretzels?</p>
<p>EDDIE: No, thanks.  We're on duty.  A couple beers would be nice, though.</p>
<p>MOE: That'd be two bucks, boys.  Just kidding.</p>
<p>He hands them the beer.</p>
<p>LOU:  Good one, Moe.  Hey listen, we're looking for a family of Peeping Toms who's been terrorizing the neighborhood.</p>
<p>He bends down to his dog.</p>
<p>LOU: Quiet, boy, let the nice people enjoy their beers.</p>
<p>The dog growls at Homer.</p>
<p>LOU: Ah, don't worry, this dog has the scent.</p>
<p>EDDIE: Hey, what's gotten into Bobo?</p>
<p>HOMER: Eh, I got some wieners in my pocket.</p>
<p>EDDIE: That figures.  Come on, you stupid dog.</p>
<p>They drag the dog out.</p>
<p>HOMER: You know, Moe, my mom once said something that really stuck with me.  She said, &quot;Homer, you're a big disappointment.&quot;  And God bless her soul, she was really on to something.</p>
<p>BARNEY, another drinker, looks over from his beer.</p>
<p>BARNEY: Don't blame yourself, Homer.  You got dealt a bad hand.  You got crummy little kids that no one can control.</p>
<p>HOMER: You can't talk that way about my kids!  Or at least two of them.</p>
<p>BARNEY: Why, you got two I haven't met?</p>
<p>HOMER: Why, you---</p>
<p>He punches Barney.</p>
<p>HOMER: Here's five you haven't met.</p>
<p>BOXING ANNOUNCER: A tremendous night.  That's gotta hurt.</p>
<p>Barney and Homer trade punches.</p>
<p>BOXING ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, this fight is over.</p>
<p>Barney clocks Homer over his head.  Homer collapses and everybody cheers.</p>
<p>BOXING ANNOUNCER: All-Star Boxing is brought to you by...Dr. Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy Center.</p>
<p>HOMER: Huh?  What?</p>
<p>A commercial plays on TV, with a husband and a wife.</p>
<p>WIFE: Honey, aren't you going to work today?</p>
<p>HUSBAND: Oh, I don't think so.</p>
<p><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content"><br />

<p><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div></p>
<p>WIFE: Honey, you have a problem and it won't get better till you admit it.</p>
<p>HUSBAND: I admit this:  You better shut your big yap.</p>
<p>WIFE: Oh, you shut up.</p>
<p>HUSBAND: No, you shut up.</p>
<p>WIFE: No, you shut up.</p>
<p>HUSBAND: Shut up.</p>
<p>WIFE: Shut up.</p>
<p>HUSBAND: Shut up!</p>
<p>CHILD (walking into room and extra-loud): Why don't you both shut up?</p>
<p>Dr. MARVIN MONROE walks onto the scene.</p>
<p>MONROE: Hi, friends.  I'm Dr. Marvin Monroe.  Does this scene look familiar?  If so, I can help.  No gimmicks.  No pills.  No fad diets.  Just family bliss or double your money back.  So call today.</p>
<p>ANNOUNCER: Dr. Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy Center.  1-800-555-HUGS.  Why don't you call right now?</p>
<p>HOMER: When will I learn?  The answer to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle. (chuckles).  They're on TV!</p>
<p>He dials a number on his phone.</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK</p>
<p>FADE IN:</p>
<p>Simpsons TV.  The introduction of Itchy and Scratchy.  Scratchy chases Itchy.  Itchy runs into a mouse hole and Scratchy sticks his head into it.  Inside, Itchy reveals a b*mb.  Scratchy screams and Itchy shoves the b*mb into his mouth.</p>
<p>It explodes and only the skeleton of Scratchy remains. </p>
<p>Homer walks in.</p>
<p>HOMER: All right.  Time for a family meeting.</p>
<p>He turns off the TV.</p>
<p>LISA: Why can't we have a a meeting when you're watching TV?</p>
<p>HOMER: Now, look, you know and I know this family needs help.  Professional help.  So I've made us an appointment with Dr. Marvin Monroe.</p>
<p>BART: The fat guy on TV?</p>
<p>LISA: You're sending us to a doctor who advertises on pro wrestling?</p>
<p>HOMER: Boxing, Lisa, boxing.  There's a world of difference.</p>
<p>MARGE: Gee, Homer, are you sure this is the right thing to do?</p>
<p>HOMER: Honey, I've given this matter a lot of study and of all the commercials I saw, his was the best.  All it costs is 250 dollars.</p>
<p>MARGE: We don't have that kind of money.</p>
<p>HOMER: Well, then, we're just going to have to dig deep.  Marge, go get the kids' college fund.</p>
<p>LISA: Hey.</p>
<p>MARGE: Oh, Homer.</p>
<p>HOMER: Oh, come on Marge.  Why scrimp now on the off chance that they'll actually get in some place?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>The Simpson family table, where the family counts coins and dollars bills.</p>
<p>MARGE: Forty eight.  Forty nine.  Fifty.  Eighty eight dollars and fifty cents.</p>
<p>HOMER: That's it?  That's the college fund we've been saving for all these years?</p>
<p>LISA: I guess I'd have needed a partial scholarship.</p>
<p>HOMER: Well, we're not licked yet.  To save this family, we're going to have to make the supreme sacrifice.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>A pawn shop.</p>
<p>LISA: No, Dad.  Please don't pawn the TV.</p>
<p>BART: Oh, come on, Dad.  Anything but that.</p>
<p>MARGE: Homer, couldn't we pawn my engagement ring instead?</p>
<p>HOMER: Now, I appreciate that, honey, but we need $150 here!</p>
<p>Homer walks up to the CASHIER.</p>
<p>CASHIER:  Afternoon, Simpson.  What can I do for ya?</p>
<p>HOMER: Would you pay 150 dollars for this lovely Motorola?</p>
<p>CASHIER: Is it cable ready?</p>
<p>HOMER: Ready as she'll ever be.</p>
<p>CASHIER: Mister, you got yourself a deal.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>Outside Dr. Monroe's center...establishing location.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>Dr. Monroe's sitting room.  Several angry patients sit.</p>
<p>MARGE: All our money, the college funds, the TV.  Homer, you're driving a stake through the hearts of those who love you.</p>
<p>Homer writes on a sign-up sheet.</p>
<p>HOMER: Hey, no pain, no gain.</p>
<p>RECEPTIONIST: Will you be paying by cash or check?</p>
<p>HOMER: Cash, of course.  I've got 250 dollars right here with me.  I'm holding it right now.  Here it is, look.  Check it out.  250 big ones.</p>
<p>BART: If you really want to impress her, show her the big, empty space where our TV used to be.</p>
<p>HOMER: Bart!</p>
<p>Out of the therapy room,. a family that looks similar to the Simpsons steps out.</p>
<p>DAD: Come on, family.  Let's go celebrate our newfound ability to express love for each other.  I'm taking you out for frosty chocolate milkshakes.</p>
<p>KIDS: Yay!</p>
<p>Homer plops the money down.</p>
<p>LISA: Ahh, there go my young-girl dreams of Vassar.</p>
<p>Monroe steps out.</p>
<p>MONROE: Hello, I'm Dr. Marvin Monroe.  No doubt you recognize me from TV.</p>
<p>LISA: We would if we had one.</p>
<p>HOMER: Lisa!</p>
<p>MONROE: No, no, Homer.  Don't stifle the youngster.  Your family must feel free to express itself.</p>
<p>They sit down in Monroe's room.</p>
<p>MONROE: That's what these pads and jumbo markers are for.  I want you to draw for me your fears, your anxieties, the roots of your happiness.  Now, take a deep, cleansing breath.</p>
<p>They all breathe in and out.</p>
<p>MONROE: And begin.</p>
<p>Homer hums as they all scribble.  Monroe watches interestingly.  Bart flips his pad, revealing a sketch of Homer.  Lisa's and Marge's also show Homer.</p>
<p>MONROE: Mm-hmm.  No surprises here.  Homer?  Homer, what have you got for us?</p>
<p>Homer continues dawdling.</p>
<p>MONROE: Homer?</p>
<p>HOMER: Whoops.  Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.</p>
<p>He shows his sketch of a plane destructing in mid air.</p>
<p>MONROE: Well, if you had been paying attention, perhaps you would have noticed that your family sees you as a rather stern authority figure, an ogre, if you will.</p>
<p>MARGE: Now, Doctor, that's not true.</p>
<p>LISA: Ogre is such a strong word.</p>
<p>BART: Right on, Doc!  Another successful diagnosis!</p>
<p>HOMER: That does it!</p>
<p>He snatches up a lamp and Monroe takes it back from him.</p>
<p>MONROE: Woah, okay.  You wanna k*ll each other.  That's good.  That's healthy.  There's nothing necessarily wrong with hostile conflict.  All I ask is that you use my patented aggression therapy mallets.</p>
<p>HOMER: Good idea!</p>
<p>BART: All right!</p>
<p>MARGE: I don't know.</p>
<p>MONROE: Okay, let's take another deep, cleansing breath.</p>
<p>They breath in and everybody begins hitting each other.  Even MAGGIE hits Homer on his back.  Finally, they all get tired.</p>
<p>HOMER: Wait a minute.  These mallet things are padded with foam rubber.  What's the point?</p>
<p>BART: They work much better without the padding, Doc.</p>
<p>He slides a rod out.</p>
<p>MONROE:  No, no, no, that's not true.</p>
<p>Bart smashes the rod into Monroe's foot.</p>
<p>MONROE: Ah!  Give me that.</p>
<p>BART: See?</p>
<p>MONROE: Yes, well, that concludes this portion of our treatment.</p>
<p>MARGE: Are we cured yet?</p>
<p>MONROE: Don't be ridiculous.  You will be cured, but it's going to require somewhat more unorthodox methods.</p>
<p>HOMER: Unortho-what?</p>
<p>MONROE: Don't worry.  I'll have plenty of time to explain while I warm up the...electric generator.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<p>A small labaratory, where the whole family is strapped to chairs.  Some of kind of electrical wiring is wrapped around them.</p>
<p>MONROE: Everyone comfy?  (chuckles).  Good.  Now, don't touch any of those buttons in front of you for a very important reason.  i.e. you are wired into the rest of your family.  You have the ability to shock them, and they have the ability to shock---</p>
<p>There is a buzz and Homer is suddenly shocked.  He screams.</p>
<p>BART: Just testing.</p>
<p>HOMER: Why, you---</p>
<p>MONROE: No, Homer, not yet.</p>
<p>HOMER: Awww.</p>
<p>MONROE: You see, this is what is known as aversion therapy.  When someone hurts you emotionally, you will hurt them physically.  And gradually you will learn not to hurt each other at all.  And won't that be wonderful, Homer?</p>
<p>HOMER: Oh, yes, Doctor.</p>
<p>He presses a button.  Bart is zapped.</p>
<p>BART: Whooa!</p>
<p>Bart presses the button.  Lisa is zapped.</p>
<p>LISA: Ahhh!</p>
<p>MARGE: Bart, how could you shock your little sister?</p>
<p>BART: My finger slipped.</p>
<p>Bart is suddenly zapped.</p>
<p>LISA: So did mine.</p>
<p>Lisa zapped.</p>
<p>LISA: Ahhh!</p>
<p>Bart zapped.</p>
<p>MARGE: Bart, Lisa, stop that.</p>
<p>She presses two buttons simultaneously and both are zapped.  The entire family continues zapping each other.</p>
<p>MONROE: No, no.  Now, wait a minute.  Wait!  Wait!  Folks, folks, if I could --- This is not the way to get healthy!  No!  You don't understand, Simpsons!</p>
<p>They show no sign of stopping.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>Outside the office, the lights begin to dim and the music from the radio stops.  The receptionist stares up.</p>
<p>MONROE (O.S.): People, please!</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>Outside the therapy center, where the bright banner turns off.  Then, in a wide sh*t, Springfield follows.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>In Burn's office.  Mr. Burns stares out upon Springfield.</p>
<p>SMITHERS: Boy, someone's really gobbling up the juice, sir.</p>
<p>BURNS: Excellent.  Excellent.  Perhaps this energy conservation fad is as dead as the dodo.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>Back in the chamber, where the Simpsons continue shocking each other and screeam in pain.</p>
<p>MONROE: No!  No!  Simpsons!</p>
<p>HOMER: Son of a ---!</p>
<p>The receptionist runs back in.</p>
<p>RECEPTIONIST: Dr. Monroe, your other patients have fled the building.</p>
<p>MONROE: Stop!  Stop!  You're damaging the equipment!</p>
<p>Monroe finally runs and pulls the plug.  Everybody has smoke coming from their hair.</p>
<p>BART: Hey, nice hair, Mom.</p>
<p>MARGE: Gee, I thought we were making real progress.</p>
<p>MONROE: No, I'm sorry, you're not!  Please, you've just got to go!</p>
<p>HOMER: Wait a minute, Doc, your TV commercial said, family bliss or double our money back.</p>
<p>MONROE: Oh but that was just--- all right.  Get the money.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<p>The main lobby, where Monroe counts bills.</p>
<p>MONROE: 20.  40. 60.  80.  1.  20.  40.  60.  80.  2.  20. 40. 60. 80. 3.  20. 40. 60. 80. 4.  20. 40. 60. 80. 500.  Ehh, just go and never tell anyone you were here!</p>
<p>HOMER: Wow, 500 smackers!</p>
<p>MARGE: Homer, how wonderful.  Our first pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>LISA: It's not the money as much as the feeling that we earned it.</p>
<p>BART: You did it, Dad!</p>
<p>MARGE: Excuse me dear, shouldn't we be heading down to the pawn shop to get our TV back?</p>
<p>HOMER: That piece of junk?  Forget it!  We're gonna get a new TV.  Twenty-one inch screen, realistic flesh tones, and a little cart so we can wheel it into the dining room on holidays.</p>
<p>BART AND LISA: Yay!</p>
<p>MARGE: Oh, Homer, we love you!</p>
<p>Marge and Homer kiss and then the whole family makes their way down the street as we---</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK</p>
