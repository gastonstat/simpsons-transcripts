<p>[Scattered Applause]</em></p>
<p>Thank you. I just wish Ben and Hoss and Little Joe... and Hop Sing and Sheriff Roy and all your favorites... could be alive today to see this wonderful turnout.</p>
<p>You know, on the series, we were always trying to k*ll the Cartwrights.</p>
<p>[Audience Boos]</p>
<p>But it looks like Father Time took care of that for us, right?</p>
<p>Am I right, folks?</p>
<p><em>[Man Coughs]</p>
<p>♪ [Theme Song]</p>
<p>Oh, this sucks.</em></p>
<p>Weren't there three Indians last year?</p>
<p>Look, Marge. They opened a new high-tech gadget store.</p>
<p>You love high-tech gadgets.</p>
<p>No, I don't.</p>
<p>Like bull, you don't. Come on.</p>
<p>Homer, please. You're hurting my arm.</p>
<p>No, I'm not.</p>
<p>Hey, Lise! Check out this space-age toothbrush.</p>
<p>[Buzzing]</p>
<p>That's an electric nostril groomer.</p>
<p>[Spits, Coughs]</p>
<p>Night vision goggles?</p>
<p>A bathroom scale from a soviet sub?</p>
<p>A suede briefcase case?</p>
<p>[Groans] Anyone who needs this kind of status symbol... must have some terrible emotional problems.</p>
<p>[Gasps] Marge, look!</p>
<p>&quot;The world's best jacket.&quot;</p>
<p>If I had this, it would show everybody.</p>
<p>Show everybody.</p>
<p>Yes, finally. I would like to return your quote, unquote &quot;Ultimate Belt.&quot;</p>
<p>I see. Do you have receipt, quote, unquote &quot;sir&quot;?</p>
<p>No, I do not have a receipt. I won it as a door prize at the <em>Star Trek</em> convention... although I find their choice of prize highly illogical... as the average Trekker has no use for a medium-sized belt.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa. A fat, sarcastic <em>Star Trek</em> fan.</p>
<p>You must be a devil with the ladies.</p>
<p>Hey, l- [Sighs] That- Oh.</p>
<p>Gee, I hate to let you down, Casanova, but, uh, no receipt, no return.</p>
<p>I'll give you four bucks for it.</p>
<p>[Sighs] Very well.</p>
<p>I must hurry back to my comic book store... where I dispense the insults rather than absorb them.</p>
<p><em>Wow!</em></p>
<p>I bet if God wore pants, he'd have a belt like that.</p>
<p>This isn't a belt. It's a tactical pants retaining system.</p>
<p>Check it out. Compass, matches... whistle, saw, panic button, squirrel snare, radon/lie detector... sphygmomanometer, and it's even got turn signals.</p>
<p>Wow, neat!</p>
<p>Uh-oh!</p>
<p>Hey, Simpson, wanna trade belts?</p>
<p>Well, not really...</p>
<p>'cause yours is just a piece of extension cord.</p>
<p>Hey, dude, he's raggin' on your cord.</p>
<p>Get him!</p>
<p>No running!</p>
<p>Time for a little evasive action.</p>
<p><em>Hey, he's turnin'left!</em></p>
<p>[Electronic Voice] Help, help, help, help, help!</p>
<p>I was hopin' it wouldn't come to this, but you guys asked for it.</p>
<p>Can't you read? Call the police!</p>
<p>Hey, Dad.</p>
<p>Looking good, Son.</p>
<p>Hey! What happened to your belt?</p>
<p>Some bullies b*at me up and took it.</p>
<p>Son, there's only one thing punks like that understand- squealing.</p>
<p>You've got to squeal to every teacher and every grown-up you can find.</p>
<p>Coming to me was a good start.</p>
<p>But then they'll just b*at me up even worse.</p>
<p>Yes, they are a clever bunch.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I'll squeal for ya... to their parents.</p>
<p><em>That's for telling me how to raise my lousy kid.</em></p>
<p>This is for the crummy life I've had to live.</p>
<p>[Groans]</p>
<p>The thing is- [Grunts]</p>
<p>Bart really loves that belt and- [Grunts]</p>
<p>Hey, something's wrong with this guy. He's not fallin' down.</p>
<p><em>[g*n Cocks]</p>
<p><strong>Moe</strong>: Fun's over, fellas!</em></p>
<p>If you're gonna b*at up my friend in my bar, there's a two-drink minimum.</p>
<p>Geez, Homer, I never seen a guy stand up to that kind of punishment.</p>
<p>I mean, you took a three-man pounding and didn't even fall down.</p>
<p>Big deal. I didn't even get my kid's belt back.</p>
<p>The only thing a loser like me is good for is taking b*at.</p>
<p>There you go. That's the spirit.</p>
<p>Homer, I seen prizefighters couldn't take a punch half as good as you.</p>
<p>You know, boxin' might be right up your alley.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Oh, please. It's the good life, Homer.</p>
<p>Some of these boxers, they eat steak and lobster and salad bar all in a single meal.</p>
<p>[Gasps] Dressing?</p>
<p>Their choice.</p>
<p>You really think I could do it?</p>
<p>Well, I don't know. Are you man enough to test every one of your limits?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And are you man enough... to throw a punch should the opportunity arise?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>And are you man enough to give me a 60% cut?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>I'll take it.</p>
<p>Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p><em>[Boxing Bell Rings]</p>
<p><strong>Moe</strong>: Now, Homer, if I'm gonna manage your boxing career...</p>
<p>I want you to have complete faith in me.</em></p>
<p>Come here. Let me show you somethin'.</p>
<p>Wow, I've never been in here before.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, when I realized we hadn't had no ladies in here since 1979...</p>
<p>I turned it into an office.</p>
<p>You used to be a boxer just like me?</p>
<p>Yup. They called me Kid Gorgeous.</p>
<p>Later on, it was Kid Presentable.</p>
<p>Then Kid Gruesome. And, finally, Kid Moe.</p>
<p>Hey, what's this?</p>
<p><em>[Liquid Sloshes]</em></p>
<p>Oh, that- that's my old spit bucket.</p>
<p>Yeah, I've been meanin' to empty that out.</p>
<p>You know Lucius Sweet? He's one of the biggest names in boxing.</p>
<p>He's exactly as rich and as famous as Don King... and he looks just like him too.</p>
<p>Yeah, he was my manager. Back when I was Gorgeous, everybody wanted a piece of me.</p>
<p>But, somehow, I just never made it to the big time.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>'Cause I got knocked out 40 times in a row.</p>
<p>That, plus politics. You know, it's all politics.</p>
<p>Lousy Democrats.</p>
<p><em>[Marge Groans]</em></p>
<p>Homer, of all the crazy ideas you've had... this one ranks somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>You're 38 years old, you don't know how to box... and you haven't gotten any exercise since grade school.</p>
<p>Before you even consider this, I insist you consult a doctor.</p>
<p>No problemo.</p>
<p>A competent doctor!</p>
<p><em>D'oh!</em></p>
<p>Well, sir, you more than meet... every one of this state's requirements to box, wrestle or be sh*t out of a cannon.</p>
<p>[Groans] That's what we get for living in a state founded by circus freaks.</p>
<p>You have an absolutely unique genetic condition known as &quot;Homer Simpson Syndrome.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, why me?</p>
<p>Don't worry. It's quite beneficial.</p>
<p>Your brain is cushioned by a layer of fluid one eighth of an inch thicker than normal.</p>
<p>It's almost as if you're wearing a football helmet inside your own head.</p>
<p>Why, I could wallop you all day with this surgical two-by-four without ever knocking you down.</p>
<p>But I have other appointments.</p>
<p>All right, Homer. Let's see the left.</p>
<p>[Grunts]</p>
<p>Okay. Let's see the right.</p>
<p>[Panting] Just a second.</p>
<p>When you're ready.</p>
<p>All right, I'm ready.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. All right.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Just a sec.</p>
<p>Okay, punching isn't your thing, but that's okay.</p>
<p>You're not that kind of fighter.</p>
<p>What you're gonna do is stand there while your opponent gets exhausted from over-punching.</p>
<p>Then I can just push him over.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>And if the ref's not looking, you can kick him a couple of times.</p>
<p>Who's gonna knock you down?</p>
<p>No one!</p>
<p>When are you gonna fight back?</p>
<p>Never!</p>
<p>What are you gonna do?</p>
<p>Nothin'!</p>
<p>That's my boy!</p>
<p>Man, you'd never get me into a ring.</p>
<p>Boxing causes brain damage.</p>
<p>Okay, you're fightin' a guy named Boxcar Bob.</p>
<p>Brawled his way up from the boxcars, did he?</p>
<p>Uh, no, not yet. He still lives at the train yard.</p>
<p>But he's a hungry young fighter.</p>
<p>In fact, he's actually fightin' for a sandwich.</p>
<p>Homer, I want you to have my lucky mitts.</p>
<p>I hope you do better with 'em than I did.</p>
<p>Gee, thanks, Moe. What's this?</p>
<p>Ah, that's the barbed wire. [Chuckles]</p>
<p>We, uh-We called that &quot;the stinger.&quot; They don't let you use that no more.</p>
<p>[Crowd Chattering]</p>
<p>No matter how much he hits you... you don't do nothin', okay?</p>

<p>Hello, Moe. Delightful to see you again.</p>
<p>Lucius! Hey, what's a glitterati like you doin' in my dump?</p>
<p>I thought you were managing the champ.</p>
<p><em>Yes, managing Drederick has been my highest priority...</em> even though he is temporarily incarcerated for pushing his mother down the stairs.</p>
<p>But with his impending release...</p>
<p>I've been strategizing for his glorious return to the shores of&quot;Fistiana.&quot;</p>
<p>Uh, what?</p>
<p>His comeback fight. You know, boxing.</p>
<p>Oh. Oh, man. Yeah, well, who's donatin' his body for that one, huh?</p>
<p>Well, word is you manage a stalwart young pugilist who cannot be knocked down.</p>
<p>Homer? You want Homer to fight Tatum?</p>
<p>Well, the fans are weary of fights that are over... before they have an opportunity to even get drunk.</p>
<p>I just need a body who can sustain verticality for three rounds.</p>
<p>Yeah, but Homer's no boxer.</p>
<p>He's- He's just a freak. Tatum will fustigate him.</p>
<p>Well, fustigation aside, Moe, you've got a choice.</p>
<p>You can either sit here in the ladies' room with your faded memories... or you can take your last sh*t at the big time.</p>

<p>Aw, cripes! Now I gotta comb this side over.</p>
<p>All right, Homer, I'm not gonna lie to you.</p>
<p>There's a good chance you can b*at Tatum.</p>
<p>But you gotta visualize how you're gonna win, okay?</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p><em>[Crowd Cheering]</em></p>
<p>A congenital heart defect has apparently felled Tatum... moments before he could step into the ring.</p>
<p>And, now, please welcome back into decent society... ladies and gentlemen, the heavyweight champion of the world...</p>

<p>Tatum is taking a short mid-round breather to converse with actor Charlie Sheen.</em></p>
<p>You know what's great there is the sea bass.</p>
<p>They do it blackened or sautéed. It's stupendous.</p>
<p>Okay, break it up! Break it up, you two.</p>

<p>Yes, Homer. I'm an angel. All us angels wear Farah slacks.</p>

<p>Absolutely, I would. [Chuckles]</p>
