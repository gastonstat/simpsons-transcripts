To Cur With Love<br />
Original Air Date on December 16, 2012</p>
<p>Ho, ho, ho!</p>
<p>Welcome to the Montgomery Burns Prize, rewarding excellence, in the field of alternative energy.</p>
<p>Local inventors are vying for a million dollar stipend donated by C. Montgomery Burns, as part of a court settlement for causing one billion dollars of environmental damage.</p>
<p>Shoo. Go have one of your enormous litters.</p>
<p>(growls, screeches)</p>
<p>First inventor, you, bus driver.</p>
<p>Give us the gist of your terrible idea.</p>
<p>Well, I've harnessed the ancient power of slavery to run the school bus of tomorrow.</p>
<p>(groans, sighs)</p>
<p>Whose boy is this?</p>
<p>I'll take him home.</p>
<p>You'll take his place.</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>I would like to present my Kwik-E-Smart perpetual energy machine.</p>
<p>Three years ago, I tripped over the cord, but the hotdogs, they kept rolling.</p>
<p>Some say they're powered by decaying nitrates, others by tiny insects beneath the hot dog skins.</p>
<p>(wry laugh)</p>
<p>Hard to believe I once turned down a job in Tampa, Florida, because I believed in this city.</p>
<p>That was 15 years ago.</p>
<p>They wouldn't take you now.</p>
<p>Is anyone here an actual scientist?</p>
<p>Uh, yes, I have, on occasion, dabbled in the scientific arts.</p>
<p>Frink Labs, a division of Allied Frink, the Good-Glavin people, are proud to present the Frinkasonic MHV.</p>
<p>And what, pray tell, is MHV?</p>
<p>Oh, yes, it's the Moyvin-Hoyvin Vehicle.</p>
<p>This non-magnetic babe magnet is powered entirely by, you guessed it, (quietly): sound waves.</p>
<p>(crowd murmuring)</p>
<p>(engine starts)</p>
<p>Ah, yes, you see?</p>
<p>Your quite appropriate oohs and ahs are propelling me forward.</p>
<p>It's wonderful.</p>
<p>(gasping, murmuring excitedly)</p>
<p>That's slightly more enthusiasm than I had anticipated.</p>
<p>For the love of God, step on the brakes!</p>
<p>The brakes are powered by silence.</p>
<p>(people yelling)</p>
<p>(Willie yelling)</p>
<p>Look out because of the zooming.</p>
<p>Why is it ejecting?</p>
<p>It's just a normal seat...!</p>
<p>(gasping, shouting)</p>
<p>(all screaming)</p>
<p>No! No!</p>
<p>I'm okay.</p>
<p>I'll just go live with my son.</p>
<p>(screaming) No! No!</p>
<p>Hurry up.</p>
<p>I want to get Grampa back here by 3:00, so we can get him and Maggie on the same nap schedule.</p>
<p>I've labeled all his boxes.</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>Well, I can't pick up something this heavy without my lifting belt.</p>
<p>(sudden shout) Ow!</p>
<p>You know you can't lift your lifting belt without wearing your belt-lifting-belt.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>I won't be able to help you pack up Grampa.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Just stay here and hold down the fort.</p>
<p>Hold down the fort?</p>
<p>With my bad back?</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>Man, that keyboard-playing cat is so cute.</p>
<p>(playing jazzy tune over tablet speaker)</p>
<p>&quot;Villageville&quot;?!</p>
<p>&quot;Build your own authentic medieval village.&quot;</p>
<p>I must have something better to do.</p>
<p>And ca-lick.</p>
<p>(fanfare plays)</p>
<p>Finally, a woodcutter that will do what I tell him.</p>
<p>(humming happily)</p>
<p>Holy moley!</p>
<p>He's already made a clearing.</p>
<p>Let's go for a glade.</p>
<p>(chopping and bell dinging repeatedly)</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>Just call me DeForest Kelley.</p>
<p>I gotta write that down and send it to Conan.</p>
<p>Oh, move this here-- tap.</p>
<p>Mill, mill.</p>
<p>Barn, silo.</p>
<p>Tavern, tavern, tavern, tavern, tavern, tavern...</p>
<p>Brothel.</p>
<p>Parsonage.</p>
<p>A Theater in the Round.</p>
<p>And... hay pile.</p>
<p>(panting)</p>
<p>&quot;And the Lord saw what He had made, and it was good.&quot;</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p><strong>Villagers (over speaker)</strong>: Ew.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's right, your Lord sticks his hand in his pants.</p>
<p>And yes, it is the same hand I tapped you with.</p>
<p>(bell dings)</p>
<p>Well, if I've learned anything, it's that you can't have too much iron ore.</p>
<p>Maybe one of your tavern wenches can do the laundry.</p>
<p>(shrieks) You're back.</p>
<p>Did you spend this whole time doing fake chores in a fake village?</p>
<p>It's real to them. (groans)</p>
<p>Um, where's Santa's Little Helper?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>The backyard?</p>
<p>The backyard?</p>
<p>But what if he got out through your half-completed tunnel to Flanders's fridge?</p>
<p>I don't see him anywhere.</p>
<p>You jackass.</p>
<p>You lost our dog!</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I forgot to feed my jackass.</p>
<p>(bellowing): Hank-hew.</p>
<p>(bellowing): You're welcome.</p>
<p>Santa's Little Helper.</p>
<p>Santa's Little Helper!</p>
<p>I love that dog, but that is one long, stupid name.</p>
<p>(both groaning)</p>
<p>(meows)</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>The animal shelter hasn't had any greyhounds turned in.</p>
<p>Just a dachshund, a chow, and a pregnant raccoon.</p>
<p>A lot of good backups.</p>
<p>How pregnant is the raccoon?</p>
<p>We don't want a raccoon.</p>
<p>Good, Marge.</p>
<p>Get their price down.</p>
<p>Dad, I just noticed something.</p>
<p>You're not upset enough about this.</p>
<p>Hey, Lisa's right.</p>
<p>You're the only one who hasn't cried about the dog.</p>
<p>Not a crier.</p>
<p>What? You cry all the time.</p>
<p>You cried when they canceled that show you hated.</p>
<p>Goofing on it made me feel wise.</p>
<p>(whimpering)</p>
<p>Where is that coming from?</p>
<p>From the kitchen.</p>
<p>(gasps) He's alive!</p>
<p>And he didn't pee on the floor.</p>
<p>For me, that's a perfect day.</p>
<p>(everyone talking at once)</p>
<p>Dad, why'd you shut our dog in a cabinet?</p>
<p>I'll answer that.</p>
<p>Your father's an idiot.</p>
<p>I believe the word is <em>idiote.</em></p>
<p>How did Santa's Little Helper get in there?</p>
<p>(gasps) I know what must have happened.</p>
<p>I'm going to get a snack, but first, should I introduce the black plague?</p>
<p>Mm... what could be the harm?</p>
<p>(man screaming over speaker)</p>
<p>Whoa, now I've got to buy a corpse wagon.</p>
<p>Well, that's how they get you.</p>
<p>Hmm... ooh, it's amazing how many things they can make taste like cheese.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, baby, I'm drinking you down to your knees.</p>
<p>(sniffing)</p>
<p>♪ Gonna drink ammonia ♪<br />
♪ 'Cause it tastes like cheese ♪<br />
♪ I wonder what will happen... ♪</p>
<p>A minstrel has composed a roundelay mocking me?</p>
<p>Torture, torture, torture.</p>
<p>(people screaming over speaker)</p>
<p>Well, it's time we showed this dog some love.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>(all speak soothingly)</p>
<p>Attaboy.</p>
<p>Hey Homer, how come you're not hugging the dog?</p>
<p>He knows I love him, and he loves me.</p>
<p>(growling)</p>
<p>That's short for &quot;Rrright you are.&quot;</p>
<p>I don't think you even like Santa's Little Helper.</p>
<p>You never take him for walks or sleep with him in your arms.</p>
<p>And I suspect you've been chewing on his treats.</p>
<p>How are they his treats if I paid for them?</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>I'll be nicer to the dude.</p>
<p>I've just never really been a dog person.</p>
<p>Really? What about Bongo?</p>
<p>Bongo?!</p>
<p>I told you never to ever talk about Bongo.</p>
<p>(sobbing)</p>
<p>Ever!</p>
<p>What just happened?</p>
<p>Who's Bongo?</p>
<p>Bongo was Homer's dog when he was a boy.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: He's still my dog!</p>
<p>We got him years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: I don't know what you just said, but it's wrong!</p>
<p>Wrong, wrong, wrong.</p>
<p>(sighs) I was working long hours <em>at the Springfield Smokestack Factory.</p>
<p>Oh, I was so tired when I got home.</p>
<p>Then little Homer would start crying and crying, but Bongo knew just what to do.</em></p>
<p>(howling, crying stops)</p>
<p>(snoring)</p>
<p>Now, my dear, we can watch <em>Mannix</em> as a couple.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, like all true stories, this one has a crappy ending.</p>
<p>You have a story with an ending?</p>
<p>Uh-huh. All my stories have endings now.</p>
<p>They're putting something in my Jell-O down at the home.</p>
<p>Anyway, Homer and that dog went together like Christmas and suicidal thoughts.</p>

<p>Aww.</p>
<p>(stammers, gasps)</p>
<p>I had no clue.</p>
<p>Then came the fateful day when Mr. Burns was lobbying for the go-ahead on his nuclear plant, <em>and he was giving away stuffed lsotoads to all the children.</em></p>
<p>Have a toy.</p>
<p>Don't thwart my ambition.</p>
<p>Look, they even talk.</p>
<p><strong>Electronic Voice</strong>: Cancer clusters are random occurrences.</p>
<p>Creepy.</p>
<p>You can have mine, Bongo.</p>
<p>Those toys are people bribes, you good-hearted little brat.</p>
<p>(growling)</p>
<p>Ugh! He bit me!</p>
<p>(growling) Get him out of here, son.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>Mr. Burns, I'm awfully sorry.</p>
<p>Oh, I'll be all right.</p>
<p>Once I hold your dying pet in my arms and feel his wagging tail go stiff.</p>
<p>Uh, sir, you are aware you're at a PR event for children.</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>Bring in the clown.</p>
<p>Hey-hey!</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>So, Lady Godiva gets a haircut, right, and...</p>
<p>Kids?</p>
<p>Uh, no problem.</p>
<p>I'll just cut to my clean material.</p>
<p>(muttering)</p>
<p>Farmer's daughter, no.</p>
<p>A man from Nantucket, no.</p>
<p>Bring out the monkey!</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>Next time I'm getting a smaller monkey.</p>
<p>Ow! Gow! Ooh!</p>
<p>Oh! Gah! All right!</p>
<p>So Mr. Burns wanted to k*ll Homer's dog.</p>
<p>Homer had no idea.</p>
<p>He was so innocent and chubby.</p>
<p>Course now, he's just stupid and fat.</p>
<p>Focus.</p>
<p>Huh? Oh, right.</p>
<p>Little Homer didn't know it, <em>but Burns had unleashed the local dogcatcher to bring Bongo in.</em></p>
<p>(sirens wailing)</p>
<p>♪ Little Homer had a dog ♪<br />
♪ And Bongo was his name-o ♪<br />
♪ B-O-On-On-Go ♪<br />
♪ B-O-On-On-Go... ♪</p>
<p>(tires screech)</p>
<p>Get in quick.</p>
<p><em>This was before the day of safety seats and coming to a complete stop to let your child get in.</em></p>
<p>When God closes a door, he opens a g*n shop.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>How could you know what Herman said?</p>
<p>You were driving away.</p>
<p>He wrote a memoir.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Anyway...</p>
<p>(siren blaring)</p>
<p>Son, I've got an idea.</p>
<p>A hole next to the seat to hold my cup?</p>
<p>That's a stupid idea.</p>
<p>Holding cups are what thighs are for.</p>
<p>Now hang on tight.</p>
<p>(sniffing, panting, barking)</p>
<p>(inhales) Mmm!</p>
<p>Smell them sausages, Lou.</p>
<p>Are you sure the Big Brother Program couldn't find me anybody else?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you were my last pick, too, okay?</p>
<p>Tipping, aah!</p>
<p>(barking)</p>
<p>Oh, I'm a washout as a dogcatcher.</p>
<p>What do I do now?</p>
<p>Well, my dream is to be police chief.</p>
<p>Oh, no, you can't 'cause, um, that's my dream.</p>
<p>I'm gonna be chief of police.</p>
<p>Well, then I'll be a spokesman for my people, like Ralph Abernathy.</p>
<p>Ralph, I like that name.</p>
<p>Man, this story is filling in a lot of gaps.</p>
<p>But I want to know about Dad and his broken heart.</p>
<p>Your father lost a lot in his life-- his hair, his mother, more games of Monopoly than any man ought.</p>
<p>He'd go to jail and stay there 'cause he loves the easy life, but I think losing that dog was the toughest blow of all.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Where are we going, Daddy?</p>
<p>Remember our old neighbor, Miss Viola?</p>
<p>Well, she moved to the country, where there was no limit on how many pets one single lady could own.</p>
<p>Miss Viola?</p>
<p>Isn't she cuckoo?</p>
<p>Now, son, a lot of people are cuckoo till you need something from them.</p>
<p><em>I knew that Bongo would have a good home there and Burns would never find him.</em></p>
<p>Gosh, Miss Viola, I want you and your husband to know how much I appreciate this.</p>
<p>(both groan, then goat bleats)</p>
<p>Well, let's get this dog in.</p>
<p>(whimpers) Come on.</p>
<p>Son, uh, why don't you give him your sweatshirt so he'll remember you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>How long till we come back and get him?</p>
<p><em>I had to tell my boy we were giving away his dog for good.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure if a six-year-old could even understand the concept.</em></p>
<p>What? No.</p>
<p>No! No!</p>
<p>Bongo!</p>
<p>(wailing)</p>
<p><em>Turns out, he caught on pretty quick.</em></p>
<p>Your father was devastated.</p>
<p>(crying)</p>
<p>(scoffs) Women and their crying.</p>
<p>(sobbing): Finish the damn story.</p>
<p>I've got a hockey game tonight.</p>
<p><em>When I finally got back to the house...</em></p>
<p>Simpson, release your hound.</p>
<p>He's already gone where you'll never get him.</p>
<p>I'm a powerful man, Simpson.</p>
<p>I can walk into McDonalds, order soup, and they'll make it.</p>
<p>Go on. Get.</p>
<p>I got a bug zapper, and I ain't afraid to use it.</p>
<p>Is that sugar water I smell?</p>
<p>(electrical zapping)</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>Well, I'm afraid I already told my dogs they could tear yours apart.</p>
<p>Don't make me look into those pitiless black eyes and say, &quot;Daddy didn't bring you a friend-friend to rip-rip!&quot;</p>
<p>Where's Bongo?</p>
<p>Is he still at the crazy lady's...</p>
<p>Back to sleep, son.</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>(groans, snores)</p>
<p>Oh, listen, I can think of something you'd enjoy more than k*ll a dog.</p>
<p>Dropping a horse on a church?</p>
<p>No! Breaking a man's spirit.</p>
<p>Mine.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I could always drop a horse on a church afterward.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p><em>I had to take care of his hounds for a year.</p>
<p>I tried to wear a bite-proof suit, but those satanic Snoopys always found their way in.</em></p>
<p>(growling, groaning)</p>
<p>I'm not done with you.</p>
<p>I insist you never wear shoes or a proper necktie again.</p>
<p>Just house slippers and the most humiliating tie there is: bolo.</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p><em>But the hardest part was that my son was so angry with me.</em></p>
<p>How was school today?</p>
<p>Ketchup, please.</p>
<p>You're probably wondering how I got rabies.</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>I'm not hungry anymore.</p>
<p><em>Our relationship never recovered, and no amount of ignoring the problem could ever fix it.</em></p>
<p>(sobbing)</p>
<p>Grampa, why is the saddest story you ever told the only one that's ever made sense?</p>
<p>(scoffs) Doesn't make sense to me.</p>
<p>I happen to remember it just a little differently.</p>
<p>Well, tell us your version.</p>
<p>Now granted, I was just a kid, but I say...</p>
<p><em>Grampa always hated Bongo and loved money so he sold Bongo to a wicked farm witch just so he could hang out with a bunch of rich dogs and kidnapped Santa so I'd never get the toy I actually wanted.</em></p>
<p>And then... then wha... and then what happened... was...</p>
<p>(stammers)</p>
<p>Gee, my story doesn't make much sense except the Santa part.</p>
<p>Yeah, but at least it was short.</p>
<p>Wait. Wait.</p>
<p>There's one part of the story even Grampa didn't know about.</p>
<p>A few months later, I went to rescue Bongo.</p>
<p>(coughing)</p>
<p>Hendrix, come here, boy.</p>
<p>(barking)</p>
<p><em>But there was one thing I wasn't prepared for.</p>
<p>Bongo was... happy without me.</p>
<p>He had become her dog.</em></p>
<p>Oh, Homie.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>Well, that's just the way dogs are.</p>
<p>The most disloyal, unfaithful creatures God ever made.</p>
<p>Homer, maybe you should take a look at this.</p>
<p>A Christmas card I got from Miss Viola years later.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: He still had my sweatshirt.</p>
<p>Bongo didn't forget you.</p>
<p>Unlike those gerbils of yours we gave away.</p>
<p>Oh, they were fickle as hell.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, Dad.</p>
<p>I owe you an apology.</p>
<p>You saved Bongo.</p>
<p>I never understood that till now.</p>
<p>(sobbing): All these years I thought you loved that dog more than me.</p>
<p>(sobbing): Why would you think that?</p>
<p>Just because I put you in a home where they feed you dog food?</p>
<p>Aw, give me a hug, son.</p>
<p>Okay, but I'm a little out of practice.</p>
<p>Hold your arms like you're carrying a wedding cake.</p>
<p>What flavor?</p>
<p>It doesn't matter.</p>
<p>If it doesn't matter, then I call Snickers.</p>
<p>That's not a flavor.</p>
<p>Everything's a flavor in the kitchens of today.</p>
<p>Just hug already.</p>
<p>Homie? Huh?</p>
<p>(snoring)</p>
<p>Come on, boy, time to go to bed.</p>
<p>My dog.</p>
<p>All right, Homer, it's your moment.</p>
<p>But he's mine tomorrow.</p>
<p>(both snoring)</p>
<p>♪ Me and my Arrow ♪<br />
♪ Straighter than narrow ♪<br />
♪ Wherever we go... ♪</p>
<p>More cheese, sir?</p>
<p>No. Any word from Karl Rove?</p>
<p>Sir, despite what he's been telling you, it's over.</p>
<p>Romney lost.</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>I guess it's time I explain to these good people the upcoming fiscal cliff.</p>
<p>Think of the economy as a car and the rich man as the driver.</p>
<p>If you don't give the driver all the money, he'll drive you over a cliff.</p>
<p>It's just common sense.</p>
<p>Furthermore, rich people feel things more deeply than the common man.</p>
<p>(screaming, sobbing)</p>
<p>And we've got to change our approach to immigration.</p>
<p>I have a progressive proposal to let into this country 200 grimy lrishmen a year.</p>
<p>I've got lots of potatoes that need peeling and stables to be mucked out.</p>
<p>Sir, the insta-polls are in.</p>
<p>You're just digging yourself deeper.</p>
<p>Well, then let me just say this.</p>
<p>Marco Rubio... (speaking Spanish)</p>
<p>I'm afraid you just made things even worse.</p>
<p>How? Why?</p>
<p>You just said Marco Rubio is a pink handkerchief.</p>
<p>This public service announcement is over.</p>
<p><strong>Burns</strong>: <em>Execute the cameraman.</em></p>
<p>Shh!</p>
