							<p>Hey, Homer, did I wake you?</p>
<p>I'm up! I'm up!</p>
<p>I wanted to tell you about a new BBQ joint.</p>
<p>Oh, BBQ!</p>
<p>It's called Greasy Joe's Bottomless BBQ Pit.</p>
<p>I can still taste the sauce. And get this: -It's all-you-can-eat!</p>
<p>This is like some beautiful dream!</p>
<p>And one and two and three and reach... and five and six and--</p>
<p>Marge, I've got five words to say to you.</p>
<p>Greasy Joe's Bottomless BBQ Pit.</p>
<p>You promised you'd only have six servings of pork a week.</p>
<p>I'm only human. Now look, here's what we're gonna do: We'll take the kids to your sisters' Saturday night.</p>
<p>Then we'll eat till they kick us out!</p>
<p>Saturday night? I'm not sure they're available.</p>
<p>I'll take that bet.</p>
<p>Hello, Marge.</p>
<p>Saturday, we're going to Stanley Peterson's wedding.</p>
<p>Although he's going at her like they're already married.</p>
<p>Hey, alley cats. Save it for the honeymoon!</p>
<p>Well, if you have other plans....</p>
<p>It's no problem.</p>
<p>We'll leave before they toss the bouquet.</p>
<p>&quot;F.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;L.&quot; No, I'm sorry. That's a &quot;C, &quot; isn't it?</p>
<p>If that was a car, you'd be dead now.</p>
<p>But driving is my livelihood.</p>
<p>Take it like a man.</p>
<p>Friends, relatives, work-related acquaintances... we are gathered here to join Stanley and Martha in holy matrimony.</p>
<p>Martha, my dear, I remember the first day that I met you.</p>
<p>Hello, Selma.</p>
<p>Hello, Stanley.</p>
<p>Is this seat taken?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Hey, b*at it!</p>
<p>Had I not chosen that seat, Martha, my love... who knows what woman I might have ended up with?</p>
<p>Poor Brandy. Aunt Selma?</p>
<p>Will you ever get married?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Why? You know somebody?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I'm sure you'd resent my pity, so I'll hope you're... one of the statistically small number of single 40-year-olds... who find their fair prince.</p>
<p>Patty! Selma! We're home!</p>
<p>I'll tell you one thing, Greasy Joe is sorry he ever met me!</p>
<p>Marge, I need to speak with you.</p>
<p>Oh, and that sauce, Barney! I could have drunk a bowl of it!</p>
<p>No, that's just my sister-in-law.</p>
<p>I'll get right to it. I'm getting older and uglier.</p>
<p>Please, Marge, help me find a man before it's too late.</p>
<p>Well, I'll try.</p>
<p>Do you remember when you made us go to the Bowler's Hall of Fame... so you could see that car shaped like a giant bowling pin?</p>
<p>Remember? Who could forget?</p>
<p>Then you'll also remember you owe me a favor... to be called up whenever and for whatever reason I desire.</p>
<p>But that was just an idle promise.</p>
<p>Not to me!</p>
<p>I want you to find Selma a husband.</p>
<p>Find a husband?!</p>
<p>Wait, which one's Selma?</p>
<p>She's the one who likes Police Academy movies... and walking in the park on autumn days.</p>
<p>I thought she was the one who didn't like to be touched.</p>
<p>Patty chose celibacy but Selma simply had it thrust upon her.</p>
<p>But Marge--</p>
<p>Homer, you will find her a man!</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And not just any man!</p>
<p>He should be honest and caring and well-off and handsome!</p>
<p>Why should she have a better husband than you?</p>
<p>Sodium tetrasulfate is caustic and can remove your skin.</p>
<p>Say when.</p>
<p>When!</p>
<p>What's this for?</p>
<p>It's used in making rayons, film and as a preservative in fast foods.</p>
<p>It's also a potent herbicide.</p>
<p>What's a herbicide?</p>
<p>It k*ll grass.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Must find man.</p>
<p>Must find man.</p>
<p>Must find man.</p>
<p>Boy, a good man really is hard to find!</p>
<p>According to my sources, you are simultaneously planning... to drop your pencils at 2: 15. Do so and you will be suspended.</p>
<p>Who squealed?</p>
<p>You can't get anything past him.</p>
<p>He knows everything.</p>
<p>Vandalism fans, hold on to your hats.</p>
<p>He'll never get away with it.</p>
<p>He just goes too far.</p>
<p>One seafood burrito, Apu.</p>
<p>The time has come for money to change hands.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>Say what they will about our cafeteria... I still think they're the best Tater Tots money can buy.</p>
<p>Wait a minute... that smells like sodium tetrasulfate... bonding with chlorophyll.</p>
<p>Sweet Lord, it is!</p>
<p>Simpson!</p>
<p>Surely you knew that by writing &quot;Bart&quot; in 40-foot letters... you would be caught.</p>
<p>Maybe it was another Bart.</p>
<p>There are none!</p>
<p>The sheer contempt makes me wish I could use the board of education.</p>
<p>Call your father.</p>
<p>Is Homer there?</p>
<p>Homer who?</p>
<p>Homer Sexual.</p>
<p>Wait one second, let me check.</p>
<p>Homer Sexual!</p>
<p>Come on, one of you guys has got to be Homer Sexual!</p>
<p>Don't look at me!</p>
<p>You little punk! If I get ahold of you...</p>
<p>...I'll rip your face off!</p>
<p>You'll do what, young man?</p>
<p>What? Wait. Who is this?</p>
<p>The question is, who's this and where is Homer?</p>
<p>Sorry, Principal Skinner. It's a bad connection, I think.</p>
<p>For you. I think Bart's in trouble again.</p>
<p>What now?</p>
<p>The v*ctim is the grass... on groundskeeper Willie's award-winning play field.</p>
<p>If it's okay with you... I'd like to punish Bart through backbreaking physical labor.</p>
<p>Re-sodding the field manually, seed by seed.</p>
<p>But enough about Bart. Tell me, are you married?</p>
<p>Only to my job.</p>
<p>But if you weren't, you'd tend to go for a girl?</p>
<p>These pants come off at night just like everybody else's.</p>
<p>Why all the questions?</p>
<p>Oh, no reason.</p>
<p>I was just wondering if... you'd like to come over to my house for dinner.</p>
<p>A payback for all the things Bart has done!</p>
<p>Well, a home-cooked meal would be a nice change of pace.</p>
<p>I'd be delighted!</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Good evening and welcome to our home.</p>
<p>I only hope we can put our differences aside for the next few hours.</p>
<p>Just get inside already.</p>
<p>He's here.</p>
<p>What are you waiting for? Go shake your moneymaker.</p>
<p>I'm too nervous. You do it.</p>
<p>No, you do it.</p>
<p>No, you do it.</p>
<p>I had a discomforting thought on the way here.</p>
<p>This dinner wouldn't be a plan to set me up with some... unmarried relation, would it? Because I can--</p>
<p>Be still, my foolish heart.</p>
<p>Here we go. Boy meets beast.</p>
<p>Allow me to introduce you to my wife's lovely...</p>
<p>...and available sister, Selma.</p>
<p>Hey, tubs, I'm Patty!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Patty.</p>
<p>D'oh! Wrong one.</p>
<p>So, Patty, tell me, tell me more about your trip to Egypt.</p>
<p>Nothing more to tell, really.</p>
<p>The Nile smells and the horseflies are huge.</p>
<p>Marvelous. Just marvelous.</p>
<p>Well, Selma hated Egypt too. A camel spit on her.</p>
<p>They can be difficult. Patty... the Parents Advisory Board asked that I see Space Mutants Part V.</p>
<p>Would you be interested in joining me?</p>
<p>I don't--</p>
<p>She'd be delighted!</p>
<p>I'll cancel.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We already had plans.</p>
<p>Your first date in 25 years is more important than playing cards.</p>
<p>I tried to repel him, really.</p>
<p>Pack of Lady Laramies.</p>
<p>It could easily have been me. Very easily.</p>
<p>Laramie Hi-Tars, hard pack.</p>
<p>Here you go. Smoke them in good health. Any lottery tickets with that?</p>
<p>No. All right, five.</p>
<p>Stupid Principal Skinner. You gotta be kidding me.</p>
<p>Save your strength, lad. There's a whole field for you to re-sod yet.</p>
<p>Bart, you wouldn't know what sort of candy your aunt likes, would you?</p>
<p>Cherry cordials, sir.</p>
<p>Oh, very good.</p>
<p>Now then, regarding your punishment, have you learned your lesson?</p>
<p>Have I ever. The thought of doing wrong makes my stomach turn.</p>
<p>Well, you're free to go.</p>
<p>Willie, you can take it from here. Adiós.</p>
<p>You haven't seen the last of Willie!</p>
<p>I don't see why this is necessary.</p>
<p>You don't want to show up for your big date looking like Yosemite Sam.</p>
<p>How do I look?</p>
<p>Achingly beautiful.</p>
<p>Cherry cordials. I hope you like them.</p>
<p>They're okay. Let's get this over with.</p>
<p>Let's start with the Springfield Revolving Restaurant.</p>
<p>Food tastes better when you're revolving.</p>
<p>This evening has been disappointing.</p>
<p>Indeed. Terrible.</p>
<p>Hey! Can we get some service over here?</p>
<p>I keep asking for water.</p>
<p>Is everything all right?</p>
<p>Little Jimmy Pearson.</p>
<p>Class of '71, right?</p>
<p>Principal Skinner.</p>
<p>Get this woman a glass of water! And tuck in your shirt.</p>
<p>Nearly 30 and still working as a busboy!</p>
<p>Standardized testing never lies.</p>
<p>I'm not surprised. She's always the lucky one.</p>
<p>Two minutes younger. Skin like a china doll. Bosoms till Tuesday.</p>
<p>Don't worry. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Right, Homer?</p>
<p>Oh, yes. Plenty of fish. We just don't have any bait.</p>
<p>Don't be stupid!</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>

<p>Oh, come on, love, loosen up.</p>
<p>I can't forget what happened to that poor dingo. What could've done it?</p>
<p>It was probably just a wallaby. Now come on.</p>
<p>Well, okay.</p>
<p>Hello, Dolly.</p>
<p>Oh, that was the worst movie I've ever seen.</p>
<p>Not as bad as the service at the revolving restaurant.</p>
<p>Isn't it nice we hate the same things?</p>
<p>So, see me again tomorrow?</p>
<p>That's my microwave cookery class.</p>
<p>Then the day after that.</p>
<p>Oh, gee, tae kwon do.</p>
<p>The day after that?</p>
<p>You're touching me.</p>
<p>Kiss me, Patty. I don't have cooties.</p>
<p>Thursday, I'm going food shopping. You can come if you like.</p>
<p>Until then.</p>
<p>I want every detail. Or is your tongue too tired?</p>
<p>The movie was awful and he didn't get anything.</p>
<p>Now good night.</p>
<p>One kiss. But I don't want you bragging to your friends.</p>
<p>Oh, I wish I could make a P.A. announcement to the whole world.</p>
<p>Attention! Seymour Skinner is in love!</p>
<p>That's cool.</p>
<p>Skinner's gonna k*ll you!</p>
<p>Skinner? He works for me now.</p>
<p>Simpson?</p>
<p>What is that there?</p>
<p>Patty.</p>
<p>I hate to pull you away from your exercise... but I wanted you to be first to know.</p>
<p>I plan to ask your aunt to marry me.</p>
<p>Your funeral.</p>
<p>Homer, lighten up. You're making happy hour bitterly ironic.</p>
<p>I gotta find a date for my big, fat, snotty sister-in-law, Selma.</p>
<p>I'm intrigued. What does she look like?</p>
<p>Like my wife's ugly sister.</p>
<p>Wheel her in, Homer. I'm not picky.</p>
<p>The rule of thumb is 2 years' salary.</p>
<p>I can't afford that!</p>
<p>I'll take it.</p>
<p>My sister's not going out with Barney Gumble!</p>
<p>She's no prize pig herself, you know!</p>
<p>Bart, come cheer up your Aunt Selma.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What did you learn in school?</p>
<p>Principal Skinner's gonna ask Patty to marry him.</p>
<p>Thanks, kid. You made my day.</p>
<p>But nothing! She's a heifer, plain and simple--</p>
<p>There's the little prom queen now.</p>
<p>Can the sweet talk! You're right. It's time to end my girlish dreams... and grab hold of the next train out of the station.</p>
<p>Is that Selma? Ring-a-ding-ding!</p>
<p>Oh, shut up.</p>
<p>Why are you all dolled up?</p>
<p>It takes a ripe piece of cheese to catch the mouse.</p>
<p>It's time to give away my love like cheap wine.</p>
<p>Take it to the hoop, Selma.</p>
<p>Hey! Look what I brought!</p>
<p>Schnapps?</p>
<p>I'll take that.</p>
<p>You seem preoccupied, my little pudding cup.</p>
<p>My sister's on a date with a big, fat rummy.</p>
<p>There's something up here that will pick up your spirits.</p>
<p>&quot;Marry me, Patty&quot;?</p>
<p>Jeezum Crow! Look at the size of that rock!</p>
<p>The second most precious jewel here.</p>
<p>Patty, will you marry me?</p>
<p>I don't know. I mean--</p>
<p>Just say whatever's in your heart.</p>
<p>It's not that I don't love you.</p>
<p>You love me!</p>
<p>Yes. Yes, but--</p>
<p>But?</p>
<p>But I'm a twin, and as such I have a--</p>
<p>Special tie to your sister!</p>
<p>Any man I could marry would have to--</p>
<p>Understand that you couldn't leave Selma.</p>
<p>Yes. So I know you appreciate why you can never....</p>
<p>See you again?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It's kind of a Catch-22.</p>
<p>Farewell, my Patty-cake.</p>
<p>Good night, sweet principal.</p>
<p>Oh, Springfield Elementary, I will have you back again!</p>
<p>After all, tomorrow is another school day!</p>
<p>And then when I got out of the service....</p>
<p>Well, the next few years are a blur.</p>
<p>Where's Skinner?</p>
<p>We decided we loved each other enough never to see each other again.</p>
<p>I hope I can find a man like that.</p>
<p>Are you throwing away happiness for me?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Now let's go get some pancakes.</p>
<p>Listen, Barney....</p>
<p>She broke my heart, Moe.</p>
<p>Don't worry, Barney. Time heals all wounds.</p>
<p>What do you know? You're right.</p>
<p>And look, a whole pitcher to myself.</p>
<p>I told you you'd be back!</p>
