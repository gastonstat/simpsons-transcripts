<p>(YAWNS)  </p>
<p>If I wanted to be bored on a Saturday, I would have signed up for that management training program at work.  </p>
<p>At least there I know where the good toilets are.  </p>
<p>Wait, what training program?   </p>
<p>Oh, it's some dumb career development thing at the plant, so you can become a manager and have more responsibility. (LAUGHS)   </p>
<p>Who needs that trap?   </p>
<p>But we could really use more money.   </p>
<p>You've had the same entry-level job your whole career.   </p>
<p>Hey, don't knock entry level, Marge.   </p>
<p>At least I don't have to wear long-sleeve shirts, go to webinars and supervise a bunch of entry-level losers, with their short-sleeve shirts.   </p>
<p>Homer, I can't be the only one in this family who wants more for us.   </p>
<p>(GASPS) I want more.   </p>
<p>I just don't want to do anything to earn it.   </p>
<p>For once in your life, would it k*ll you to show a little ambition?   </p>
<p>- (HUFFS)<br />
- (HUFFS)   </p>
<p>Ah, ambition is indeed a timeless source of conflict.   </p>
<p>(GASPS) A lost senior.   </p>
<p>(ENUNCIATING): Where is your family?   </p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I just curated an exhibit about a Roman family torn asunder by the hunger for more.   </p>
<p>The life of Obeseus the Wide.   </p>
<p>Ooh, maybe an historical allegory could help us work out our issues.   </p>
<p>Once again, bickering in public gets us free therapy from strangers.   </p>
<p>Bickering most tragic.   </p>
<p>For ambition was the force that built the Roman empire and that which tore it apart.   </p>
<p><em>Obeseus was born to a poor farmer</em>   </p>
<p><em>with much land, but no ox to plow it.</em>   </p>
<p><em>So he improvised.</em>   </p>
<p><em>Life on the farm was cruel.</em>   </p>
<p><em>But it chiseled young Obeseus into quite</em>   </p>
<p><em>the Italian beefcake.</em>   </p>
<p>Good news, plow son.   </p>
<p>We finally got enough money to buy us an ox.   </p>
<p>Woo-hoo! How'd you do that, father?   </p>
<p>I sold you into slavery.   </p>
<p>- Arrivederci, sucker.<br />

<p>Gentlemen, today you have the honor of being hacked to death on the field of battle.   </p>
<p>Us? But we're not gladiators.   </p>

<p>No, father, look how the crowd loves him.   </p>
<p>That hunky rube could put a lot of togas in the seats.   </p>
<p>Majora, you have quite the mind for the family business.    </p>
<p>The man-ox will live to fight another day.    </p>

<p>They got to start cutting you guys into smaller pieces.    </p>
<p>Let us make a sacred pact before the gods.    </p>
<p>If one of us ever gets free, he'll do everything he can to free the rest of us.    </p>
<p>To freedom.    </p>
<p>ALL: To freedom!    </p>
<p>Yeah, to freedom. (CHUCKLES)    </p>
<p>Eh, you chunks are no fun.    </p>
<p>Well, if it isn't the champion of Rome himself.    </p>
<p>(GASPS) Lady Majora.    </p>
<p>What are you doing here?    </p>
<p>I have to keep an eye on my father's investments.    </p>

<p>(GROWLS, LAUGHS)    </p>
<p>Mm-hmm.    </p>
<p>(SING-SONGY): Swish and slash and spin and kick and slice that belly and hello, guts.    </p>
<p>It would appear that one of you lowly gladiators has impregnated my daughter.    </p>
<p>Tell me who laid with her, and the rest of you will be spared the lash.    </p>

- D'oh!    </p>
<p>(CHUCKLING): I-I mean, great.    </p>

<p>Aw, slaves? You shouldn't ha...    </p>

<p><em>CURATOR: Majora then understood:</em>    </p>

<p>Why do we even bother asking anymore?    </p>
<p>He's never gonna free us.    </p>
<p>This has been building up for a while:    </p>
<p>You give slave owners a bad name.    </p>
<p>(GASPS) What?    </p>
<p>- (SIGHS) What a giant jerk.<br />
- Ugh, he's the worst.    </p>
<p>Dad, Bartigula's out of control.    </p>
<p>Look what he's doing to Ptolemaic book guy.    </p>
<p>- Ow.<br />
- Why are you flaying yourself?    </p>
<p>- Ow!<br />
- Why are you flaying yourself?    </p>
<p>An interesting paradox.    </p>
<p>For does free will truly exist or... Ow!    </p>
<p>Growing up rich and spoiled has turned your son into a monster.    </p>
<p>It's not my fault.    </p>
<p>I never spend any time with him.    </p>

My daughter's not a son.    </p>

<p>Just gonna take a bath in warm donkey milk and go to sleep.    </p>
<p>I can't believe the emperor didn't even come to my party.    </p>
<p>He wouldn't even be emperor if not for you.    </p>
<p>Yeah, well, what do you want me to do about it... k*ll the emperor?    </p>
<p>Well, if that's what you want.    </p>
<p>You can even use the present I got you.    </p>

<p>We started at the bottom and now we're one rung from the top.    </p>

<p>Will you never be satisfied?    </p>
<p>Pardon me, senator.    </p>
<p>I'm sorry you find my ambition so distasteful.    </p>

- The emperor is dead!    </p>
<p>Who will nominate his successor?    </p>
<p>Friends, Romans, countrymen.    </p>
<p>That's me.    </p>
<p>We deserve an emperor who can boldly lead us into the future.    </p>
<p>My son, Bartigula.    </p>
<p>Wha?!    </p>
<p>He was born rich, so he got to be good at business.    </p>
<p>(CHANTING): Bartigula!    </p>
<p>Bartigula! Bartigula!    </p>
<p>Bartigula!    </p>
<p><em>CURATOR: And so began the reign of Bartigula the Jerk.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Eager to expand the empire, he declared w*r</em>    </p>
<p><em>on Neptune, god of the sea.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Despite some early victories,</em>    </p>
<p><em>thousands drowned.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Bartigula blamed the troubles of Rome</em>    </p>
<p><em>on foreign invaders.</em>    </p>
<p>So he built a large and expensive wall to keep them out.    </p>
<p>Awk, who needs ya?    </p>
<p>Ya carthage-sacking aqueduct guzzlers.    </p>
<p><em>CURATOR: And finally, to silence his critics,</em>    </p>
<p><em>Bartigula dissolved the senate.</em>    </p>
<p>Aah!    </p>
<p><em>CURATOR: The young emperor had gone mad with power.</em>    </p>
<p><em>And syphilis.</em>    </p>
<p>Listen up, Rome-wads.    </p>
<p>The empire's in crisis, the economy's in the crapatorium, and Neptune's kicking our butts, somehow.    </p>
<p>I now realize...    </p>
<p>I can no longer be your emperor.    </p>
<p>Oh. Phew.    </p>
<p>Because I am now your god!    </p>
<p>(CROWD CLAMORING)    </p>
<p>That's it. I'm taking a stand.    </p>
<p>(GRUNTING)    </p>
<p>My son isn't a god.    </p>
<p>He's just an entitled little psycho.    </p>
<p>Society must come to its senses and overthrow this madman!    </p>
<p>- Uh... Uh...<br />
- Hmm. I don't know.    </p>
<p>Blasphemy! Seize him!    </p>
<p>For your heresy, father, I sentence you to be eaten by the lions.    </p>
<p>(GASPS)    </p>
<p>Hmm. We're gonna need more lions.    </p>
<p>Why are we here?    </p>
<p>They said I could bring a couple of belongings.    </p>
<p>Hey, this is where we made our freedom pact, remember?    </p>
<p>The one you refused to honor for    years.    </p>
<p>(SIGHS) Not freeing you guys was the first worst thing I ever did, but I hereby decree you to be emancipated.    </p>
<p>Now face the dawn as free men.    </p>
<p>- We're in a jail cell, you dope.<br />
- (WHINES)    </p>
<p>Father, we have to get you out of the city.    </p>
<p>Hurry, and you can still escape.    </p>
<p>No, I'm not going to run.    </p>
<p>Because you physically can't?    </p>
<p>Yes, mostly, but also because we have to stop Bartigula and save the republic.    </p>
<p>Are you fellas with me?    </p>
<p>Uh... No.    </p>
<p>(GROANS)    </p>
<p>Oh.    </p>
<p><em>CURATOR: Though he had lost everything,</em>    </p>
<p><em>Obeseus still had the heart of a warrior.</em>    </p>
<p>(LAUGHING)    </p>

<p>- (LAUGHTER)<br />
- Oh, yeah.    </p>
<p>All hail the living god.    </p>
<p>We who are about to die    </p>
<p>salute you.    </p>
<p>- Oh!<br />
- (CROWD LAUGHING)    </p>
<p>(GROANS)    </p>
<p>You dare show me your moon flaps?    </p>
<p>I will teach this old fool who is the true Gluteus Maximus.    </p>
<p>Bartigula, no!    </p>
<p><em>CURATOR: There, in front of all Rome,</em>    </p>
<p><em>father and son engaged in bloody battle.</em>    </p>
<p>(WHIMPERS)    </p>

<p>Why, you littleus...    </p>
<p>(BOTH GRUNTING)    </p>
<p><em>No!</em>    </p>
<p>(PANTING) My life is over.    </p>
<p>I failed Rome, was a less-than-perfect father.    </p>
<p>Worst of all, I really screwed over my friends.    </p>
<p>May the... Gods... forgive me.    </p>
<p>(GRUNTS)    </p>
<p>I poisoned everything I loved with my boundless ambition.    </p>
<p>My family is no more.    </p>
<p>(SIGHS)    </p>
<p>Mom, what about me?    </p>
<p>We never really... clicked.    </p>
<p><em>CURATOR: With that, the match was lit</em>    </p>
<p><em>that would burn Rome to the ground...</em>    </p>
<p>    years later.    </p>
<p>Haw-haw!    </p>
<p>Who knew history could be so sad?    </p>
<p>The moral of that story is clear:    </p>
<p>Marge is wrong and ambition is terrible.    </p>
<p>No, no, no.<br />
The lesson is that the unchecked lust for money and power can bring a once-great nation to ruin.    </p>
<p>Does anyone think it was weird that dad k*ll me?    </p>
<p>Don't blame me. Blame your mother.    </p>
<p>I just wanted you to go to one lousy training seminar.    </p>
<p>Did you not even listen to the old guy's story about...    </p>

- (CURATOR GROANS)    </p>
<p>When will humanity ever learn...to stop letting stupid people into museums?    </p>
<p>- (OVERLAPPING CHATTER)<br />
- They're missing the whole point.    </p>
<p>If Rome had kept worshipping us, everything would have been fine.    </p>
<p>Get over it, Dad.    </p>
<p>You always get so worked up whenever you watch the mortals.    </p>
<p>Can we change the channel?    </p>
<p>This show sucks now.    </p>
<p>Yeah, it's totally gone off the rails since season     .    </p>
<p>I know, but I want to see how it ends.    </p>
<p>Definitely feels like they're wrapping it up.    </p>
<p>Any day now.    </p>
