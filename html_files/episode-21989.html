							<p><em>The Simpsons</em></p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Ick, my mouth tastes like an ashtray.</p>
<p>Smithers, wait your turn. There's plenty of hot water for all.</p>
<p>Sir, you weren't sh*t.</p>
<p>It was all a dream.</p>
<p>That's right. The year is 1965.</p>
<p>And you and I are undercover detectives on the hot-rod circuit.</p>
<p>Now let's burn rubber, baby!</p>
<p><em>Speedway Squad! In color.</p>
<p>Wait. That was all a dream.</em></p>
<p>Aw! Hey, then maybe I haven't become a hideous, drunken wreck.</p>
<p>And- Oh.</p>
<p>Dozens of people are g*n down each day in Springfield... but until now none of them was important.</p>
<p>I'm Kent Brockman. At 3:00 p. m. Friday, local autocrat C. Montgomery Burns... was sh*t, following a tense confrontation at town hall.</p>
<p>Burns was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>He was then transferred to a better hospital, where doctors upgraded his condition to alive.</p>
<p>Now let's talk to Police Chief Wiggum.</p>
<p>Oh. Oh, hiya, Ken.</p>
<p>Uh, right now we are questioning two witnesses... who were in the vicinity at the time.</p>
<p>Did you see this guy? Was he anywhere near the parking lot when Burns got sh*t?</p>
<p>Oh, it's no use. They ain't talkin'.</p>
<p>Everyone in Springfield had a reason to sh**t Mr. Burns.</p>
<p>Even us.</p>
<p><em>Bart, he broke your dog's legs.</p>
<p>Grampa, he destroyed your home.</p>
<p>And, Dad, well, you kinda went berserk when he couldn't remember your name.</em></p>
<p>Berserk is right!</p>
<p>May I have some iced tea, please?</p>
<p>Aren't we forgetting someone, sister suspect?</p>
<p>Yeah, I was just getting to me.</p>
<p>Because of Mr. Burns, they canceled my jazz program... and my friend Tito Puente got fired.</p>
<p>But I could never sh**t someone.</p>
<p>Could so.</p>
<p>Could not. Could not.</p>
<p>Could so. Could so.</p>
<p><em>Kids, kids, kids. As far as Daddy's concerned, you're both potential m*rder.</em></p>
<p>The police already have a suspect. It's Mr. Smithers.</p>
<p>Oh, I bet he's the one. Yeah, Smingers did it.</p>
<p>Case closed. Now, where's my hat? I'm going to the outhouse.</p>
<p>We don't have an outhouse.</p>
<p>My toolshed! Oh, Dad!</p>
<p>Oh! Could I have sh*t Mr. Burns in a drunken rage?</p>
<p>No, no, not me. I know in my heart I-</p>
<p>A g*n.</p>
<p>And it's been recently fired. Wait.</p>
<p>I remember leaving the town meeting.</p>
<p><em>I must have run into Mr. Burns outside and-</em></p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Mr. Burns. What have I done?</p>
<p>Hey, Homer, us hotheads here is gonna go tear down Burns's sun-blockin' machine.</p>
<p>You wanna come with?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I've had it up to here with these damn rickets.</p>
<p>Pull, Duchess, pull!</p>
<p>Um, uh, what town did we just crush?</p>
<p>Shelbyville.</p>
<p>Oh, this guilt is driving me mad.</p>
<p>I've got to tell someone.</p>
<p>Father, I'm not a Catholic, but-</p>
<p>Well, I tried to march in the St. Patrick's Day parade.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've got a rather large sin to confess.</p>
<p>I'm the one who- who sh*t Mr. Burns.</p>
<p>That's all I needed to hear. Boy, this thing works great.</p>
<p>The man became consumed by greed. He'd steal from anyone.</p>
<p>This isn't a rival company you're battling with. It's a school.</p>
<p>People won't stand for it.</p>
<p>Pish-posh.</p>
<p>It will be like taking candy from a baby.</p>
<p><em>Say, that sounds like a &quot;larf. &quot;</em></p>
<p>And when he tried to steal our sunlight... he crossed that line between everyday villainy and cartoonish super-villainy.</p>
<p>Bah! He was a rank amateur... compared to Dr. Colossus.</p>
<p>Ow! Oh! When is my lawyer coming?</p>
<p><em>Uh, Dave Shutton, Springfield Daily Shopper.</em></p>
<p>Who are you? Where you going?</p>
<p>Oh, do your research, Shutton. Uh, Kent Brockman, Channel Six News.</p>
<p>How does it feel to be accused of the attempted m*rder of your boss and mentor?</p>
<p>Kent, I- I feel about as low as Madonna... when she found out she missed Tailhook.</p>
<p>I'm gonna say ouch for Madonna.</p>
<p>Hey, that's my Madonna gag. That guy stole my gag.</p>
<p><em>And you stole it from last Friday's episode of Pardon My Zinger.</em></p>
<p>Stole, made up-what's the difference?</p>
<p>Mr. Smithers must have seen that program too.</p>
<p>He never misses it. Hmm.</p>
<p>At the town meeting, he mentioned that he watched Comedy Central.</p>
<p>I made sure to note that, as it seemed quite unusual.</p>
<p>Ye gods! To the police station, Krusty!</p>
<p>I am Melvin Van Horn, and this is my associate, Hershel Krustofski.</p>
<p>Hey, hey.</p>
<p>Officers, you have arrested an innocent man.</p>
<p>Really? Oh, geez. All right, Colossus, you're free to go.</p>
<p>But stay away from Death Mountain.</p>
<p>But all my stuff is there.</p>
<p>I was referring to Waylon Smithers.</p>
<p>Mr. Burns was sh*t Friday at 3:00 p. m...</p>
<p><em>the very time that Smithers was at home watching Pardon My Zinger.</em></p>
<p>So, you see, he couldn't have done it.</p>
<p>Yes, you're right. I remember now.</p>
<p>I- I watched that entire show.</p>
<p>In fact, I left the town meeting early so I could get home in time.</p>
<p>Oh, I gotta run, or I'll miss the opening rank-out.</p>
<p><em>You better get out of my way, please.</em></p>
<p>Slow down. The sidewalk's for regular walkin', not for fancy walkin'.</p>
<p><em>Get outta my way. I'm in a hurry.</em></p>
<p>You simmer down, I'll let you go.</p>
<p>So, instead of wounding an evil old man...</p>
<p>I may have k*ll an innocent old man.</p>
<p>That's much worse.</p>
<p>About 50,000 volts worse, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Sizzle!</p>
<p>Wait a minute. If a second old geezer got sh*t, how come nobody reported it?</p>
<p>Uh, hi. Um, could we take a look at your leg?</p>
<p>Yeah, it's real spruce. You like it?</p>
<p>Thank God.</p>
<p>Sir, I- I only hope you can forgive me for sh**ting your wooden leg.</p>
<p>You sh*t who in the what now?</p>
<p>Okay, Smithers, you're free to go. And, you, one question.</p>
<p>Do you know who sh*t Mr. Burns?</p>
<p>'Cause we are really up the creek on this one.</p>
<p>And with the prime suspect cleared and found completely innocent... we must now ask ourselves: Who could be as bloodthirsty as Waylon Smithers?</p>
<p>I guess it's never the most likely suspect.</p>
<p>Actually, Mom, in 95% of cases, it is.</p>
<p>The rest of the time it's usually some deranged lunatic who did it for no reason.</p>
<p>Hey, I had a damn good reason.</p>
<p>He could never remember my name.</p>
<p>Who the devil are you?</p>
<p>It's Homer Simpson! My name is Homer Simpson!</p>
<p>Well, I don't think anyone in this family is capable of attempted m*rder.</p>
<p>Uh-uh-uh. You never know what you're capable of.</p>
<p>I never thought I could sh**t down a German plane... but last year I proved myself wrong.</p>
<p>Nancy Drew says that all you need to solve a mystery... is an inquisitive temperament and two good friends.</p>
<p>And I've got an inquisitive temperament. Maybe I could help solve this.</p>
<p>I think you're a little young... to be investigating an attempted m*rder.</p>
<p>Why don't you try to solve the mystery of who put that mud in the freezer?</p>
<p>Who wants chocolate ice cream?</p>
<p>Me! Me! Me, me!</p>
<p>Okay, boys, we've got a clue- the b*llet they took out of Burns.</p>
<p>Now, let's discuss the, um, &quot;mo-tive.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Mr. Burns is the richest man in town. Maybe it's about money.</em></p>
<p>That's some good thinking, Lou.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks, Chief.</p>
<p>Hey, I said that. My name is Lisa Simpson.</p>
<p>And I made a chart of all the suspects in the Burns case.</p>
<p>Look. Mr. Burns hurt all these people financially.</p>
<p><em>Nightclub owner, Moe Syzslak.</p>
<p>His bar was closed because of Burns's negligence.</p>
<p>Liquor connoisseur, Barney Gumble.</p>
<p>When Moe's closed, Barney lost his only means of support- sucking coins out of the love tester machine.</em></p>
<p>That's a real good way to get sick.</p>
<p><em>Dedicated educator Principal Seymour Skinner.</p>
<p>His school lost millions when Burns pirated its oil well.</p>
<p>And grounds tender, Groundskeeper Willie, he lost his job... and his dream of owning a fine crystal slop bucket.</em></p>
<p>Hey, what about that jazz teacher that got laid off?</p>
<p>You know, uh, Mr. Samba, Senor Mambo. What was it?</p>
<p>Tito Puente?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, he did vow revenge.</p>
<p>But I can't see him doing something illegal.</p>
<p>He's in show business. He's a celebrity.</p>
<p>Let's roll, boys.</p>
<p>Revenge? Of course. But why wound his body with b*ll*ts... when I could set his soul afire with a slanderous mambo?</p>
<p>Listen, if you will, to my revenge.</p>
<p><em>Uno, dos, tres.</em></p>
<p>Wounds won't last long But an insulting song.</p>
<p>Burns will always carry with him <em>So I settle my score on the salsa floor.</p>
<p>With this vengeful Latin rhythm</em></p>
<p>Burns <em>Con el corazón de perro</em></p>
<p>Senor Burns <em>El diablo con dinero</em></p>
<p>It may not surprise you.</p>
<p>But all of us despise you <em>Please die.</p>
<p>And fry in hell.</p>
<p>You rotten</em></p>
<p>Rich old wretch <em>Adios viejo</em></p>
<p>Oh, olé.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Okay, okay, I believe you're innocent.</p>
<p>Gee, I hope all of the suspects are this much fun.</p>
<p><em>Hmm.</em></p>
<p>Now- Now let-</p>
<p>Let me- Let me think.</p>
<p>Now I did-</p>
<p>I did go to the town meeting with the intention of ambushing Mr. Burns.</p>
<p>When it adjourned, I rushed to the lavatory... to apply my camouflage makeup.</p>
<p>Blast! I took mother's makeup kit by mistake.</p>
<p>Oh, uh, excuse me, ma'am.</p>
<p>Superintendent Chalmers.</p>
<p><em>Oh, my God.</em></p>
<p>So, Superintendent Chalmers can vouch for your whereabouts?</p>
<p>Oh, yes. But anything else he tells you is a filthy lie.</p>
<p>I'm telling you, I could nay have sh*t Burns.</p>
<p>This is your last warning about that.</p>
<p>It's impossible for me to fire a p*stol.</p>
<p>If you'll check my medical records... you'll see I have a crippling arthritis in me index fingers.</p>
<p>Look at 'em! Oh, I got it from Space lnvaders in 1977.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, that was a pretty addictive video game.</p>
<p>Video game?</p>
<p>Do you hold a grudge against Montgomery Burns?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>All right, maybe I did, but I didn't sh**t him.</p>
<p>Checks out. Okay, sir, you're free to go.</p>
<p>Good, 'cause I got a hot date tonight.</p>
<p>A date.</p>
<p>Dinner with friends.</p>
<p>Dinner alone.</p>
<p>Watching TV alone.</p>
<p>All right! I'm gonna sit at home and ogle the ladies... in the Victoria Secret Catalog.</p>

<p>Now would you unhook this already, please?</p>
<p>I don't deserve this kind of shabby treatment.</p>
<p>Grampa, I found your cigar box dug up in the backyard, but the g*n wasn't there.</p>
<p>Have you seen it?</p>
<p>You accuse me of everything around here.</p>
<p>&quot;Who put slippers in the dishwasher?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who threw a cane at the TV?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who fell into the china hutch?&quot;</p>
<p>I was just asking if you'd seen it.</p>
<p>There's no need to be a prickly pear.</p>
<p>Oh, you're the bee's knees, baby.</p>
<p>I missed you bad.</p>
<p>Were you talking to me, Grampa?</p>
<p>Um, yes.</p>
<p>Eww!</p>
<p>We're still not close. Boy, this is gonna be an all-night brain-buster.</p>
<p>Well, better drink some coffee.</p>
<p>We're out of coffee. Well, I'll just drink this warm cream.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>I'm not following you.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Look at Burns's suit! Yeesh!</p>
<p>What? Oh! Oh.</p>
<p>I had an idea, Chief.</p>
<p>Why don't we check out that suit Burns was wearing when he got sh*t?</p>
<p>Did you have the same backwards-talking dream with the flaming cards?</p>
<p>I'll drive.</p>
<p>Eureka!</p>
<p>Ooh, nice eyelash. Yours?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We need to find out who it belonged to. We want a D.N.A. test.</p>
<p>Ooh, ooh, hey, ooh, oh. That takes eight to 10 weeks.</p>
<p>Did I say weeks? 'Cause I meant seconds.</p>
<p>What do you got, the whole town's D.N.A. on file?</p>
<p>Yuh-huh. If you've ever handled a penny, the government's got your D.N.A.</p>
<p>Why do you think they keep them in circulation? The scan's finished.</p>
<p>Now it's gonna narrow it down to the family bloodline.</p>
<p>Homer Simpson!</p>
<p>Bingo.</p>
<p>The g*n has a name-o.</p>
<p>Chief! Chief!</p>
<p>Hey, Chief Wiggum, what are you doing? What's going on?</p>
<p>I'm sorry, kid. We got Simpson D.N.A. on Burns's clothing... and your father was identified by the old man himself.</p>
<p>D.N.A. Positive I.D.</p>
<p>D.N.A. Positive I.D.</p>
<p>Those won't hold up in any court. Run, Dad!</p>
<p>Hey, ho!</p>
<p>Look what I found under Mr. Simpson's car seat.</p>
<p>I swear, I've never seen that g*n before.</p>
<p>They why are your fingerprints all over it, sir?</p>
<p>This b*llet matches the one we took out of Burns.</p>
<p>Homer Simpson, you're under arrest for attempted m*rder.</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Yeah, that's what they all say.</p>
<p>They all say, &quot;D'oh.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeah, we need two cups of coffee... and two orders of bite-sized breakfast pancakes, with extra dipping sauce.</p>
<p>Please pull up to the service window, please.</p>
<p>The wagon's too tall. Oh, I don't wanna have to get out.</p>
<p>I'll just drive up on the curb.</p>
<p>Blughh.</p>
<p><em>Almost got it.</p>
<p>Drop the food, Chief!</em></p>
<p>Dang fools. Drive-through's not for a-parkin'.</p>
<p>Diane, I'm going to take my break now.</p>
<p>Hi, everybody!</p>
<p>Ho... mer Simp... son.</p>
<p>Okay, that was a little strange.</p>
<p>Um, tell me, how you feeling today?</p>
<p>Homer... Simpson. Homer.</p>
<p>D'oh, Simpson.</p>
<p>Hmm, that seems to be all you can say.</p>
<p>When you were in that coma, did you feel your brain getting damaged?</p>
<p>The police have such a strong case against Homer.</p>
<p>Mr. Burns said he did it. They have Homer's D.N.A.</p>
<p>They have Simpson D.N.A. It could have come from any of us.</p>
<p>Except you, since you're a Bouvier.</p>
<p>No, no, no, when I took your father's name...</p>
<p>I took everything that came with it, including D.N.A.</p>
<p>Okay, Mom. Anyway, my point is... the evidence isn't as concrete as it seems.</p>
<p>Like those fingerprints. They could have gotten on the g*n some other way.</p>
<p>Are you sure you don't want me to hold one of your ice-cream cones?</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>You chose fruit. You live with fruit.</p>
<p>D'oh! You- Oh! No. No. No.</p>
<p>Eww! Why is this on the floor?</p>
<p>And we don't even know whose g*n that was.</p>
<p>Maybe somebody planted it there to frame Dad.</p>
<p>No. We can't start thinking that way about our own family members.</p>
<p>Suspicion could tear us apart.</p>
<p>That's right. We all gotta stick together... if we're gonna have any hope of bringing that awful Homer to justice.</p>
<p>Here is a photo of the fugitive from our files.</p>
<p>And now Waylon Smithers, who's been a real good sport about that wrongful arrest thing- has a statement that he would like to make.</p>
<p>Waylon.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>As Montgomery Burns's closest friend, I'm certain there is nothing he would want more... than swift, brutal revenge against Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am offering a $50,000 reward for his capture.</p>
<p>Dead or alive.</p>
<p>Holy cow! Me first! Me first!</p>
<p><em>Homer Simpson?</em></p>
<p>So, you finally learned my name, eh?</p>
<p>Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>I've got no time for your demented parlor games.</p>
<p>You won't be telling anyone else that Homer Simpson sh*t you.</p>
<p>The scene of the crime. There must be something here that can clear Dad.</p>
<p>Clue. Clue.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>Oh, Mr. Pigeon, I'd kiss you if you weren't swimming with disease.</p>
<p>So, the D.N.A. was right.</p>
<p>It must have been- Oh, Dad!</p>
<p>Attention, all units.</p>
<p>Homer Simpson has been sighted. Proceed at once to Marvin Monroe Memorial Hospital.</p>
<p>Be careful when we capture him.</p>
<p>We cannot claim the reward unless we have 51% of the carcass.</p>
<p>Stop! Don't sh**t my dad!</p>
<p>He's innocent. He wouldn't hurt a fly.</p>
<p>Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>Stop telling them it was me!</p>
<p>I'll k*ll you for saying it was me!</p>
<p>Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of this?</p>
<p>Smithers, who is this beast that's shaking me?</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Say it, Burns! Say I never sh*t you... before.</p>
<p>sh*t? By you?</p>
<p>I'm afraid not, my primitive friend.</p>
<p>Your kind has neither the cranial capacity... nor the opposable digits to operate a firearm.</p>
<p>The one who sh*t me was-</p>
<p>M-Maggie Simpson!</p>
<p>With the sun-blocker in place and the town aghast, I was on top of the world.</p>
<p><em>So, I wanted to kick up my heels and indulge my sweet tooth.</em></p>
<p>I feel like celebrating.</p>
<p>Oh, it's you. What are you so happy about? I see.</p>
<p><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p>That's the one. Smithers had thwarted my earlier attempt to take candy from a baby.</p>
<p>But with him out of the picture, I was free to wallow in my own crapulence.</p>
<p>I think you'd better drop it.</p>
<p><em>But the old axiom was misleading.</p>
<p>Taking the candy proved exceedingly difficult.</em></p>
<p>I said drop it!</p>
<p><em>Stricken, I lurched forth in search of aid.</p>
<p>But finding only slack-jawed gawkers...</p>
<p>I gave up and collapsed on the sundial.</em></p>
<p>Then with your last ounce of strength... you pointed to &quot;W&quot; and &quot;S.&quot;</p>
<p>Or, from your point of view, &quot;M&quot; and &quot;S.&quot;</p>
<p>Maggie Simpson.</p>
<p>What? No!</p>
<p>With my last ounce of strength, I sucked out my gold fillings and swallowed them.</p>
<p>Those paramedics have sticky fingers.</p>
<p>Well, I'm just relieved that Homer's safe and that you've recovered... and we can all get back to normal.</p>
<p>If Maggie could talk, I'm sure she'd apologize for sh**ting you.</p>
<p>I'm afraid that's insufficient. Officer, arrest the baby.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, Pops.</p>
<p>No jury in the world's gonna convict a baby.</p>
<p>Hmm, maybe Texas.</p>
<p>Besides, she didn't mean it. It was an accident.</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
