<p>A truck broke down, and the cops are taking their sweet time clearing it up.  </p>
<p>[LAUGHING] He thinks my tummy is a mountain.  </p>
<p>Lou, Lou, quick, take a selfie.  </p>
<p>It's not a selfie if I take it.  </p>
<p>He's kissing me.   </p>
<p>Take a selfie! Take a selfie!   </p>
<p>Oh, man, my phone's dead.   </p>
<p>Milhouse, what am I missing in the group text?   </p>
<p>It's awesome.   </p>
<p>You're never gonna get caught up.   </p>

<p><em>MARC MARON: Wow. That's incredible, Krusty.</em>   </p>
<p>I mean, really, I'm blown away.   </p>
<p>Yeah, well, it's true.<br />
It's absolutely true.   </p>
<p>I have a phobia... of pies.   </p>
<p>That's so crazy because, I mean, we've all seen you get hit in the face with pies on your show.   </p>
<p>No, no, no, those are cakes decorated as pies.   </p>
<p>Oh, right, so that's how you make yourself feel safe.   </p>
<p>It's not the crust; it's the fillings.   </p>
<p>Krusty, I got to ask you about something, and-and I don't want you to get defensive, but it's something you've never talked about.   </p>
<p>Can you tell me about <em>The Sands of Space?</em>   </p>
<p>Oh, no. That's off-limits, soul patch!   </p>
<p>We could talk about the exploding milkshakes in your Laffy Meals.   </p>
<p>Did they ever find those kids' noses?   </p>
<p>Okay, okay, I'll tell you about <em>The Sands of Space,</em> the movie that almost consumed my soul.   </p>
<p>[ELECTRIC CAN OPENER WHIRRING]   </p>
<p>- [CATS MEWLING]<br />
- Yeah, yeah, keep talking.   </p>
<p>I'm just feeding the cats.   </p>
<p>[LOUDLY]: It all began back in the golden age of Hollywood,   </p>
<p><em>the late     s, when high concept was king.</em>   </p>
<p><em>You'd mix two kooky words together in the title,</em>   </p>
<p><em>put a rap song at the end that explains the plot,</em>   </p>
<p><em>and bam... you're on the cover</em> <em>of</em> Premiere<em> magazine.</em>   </p>
<p><em>I had starred in the hit action buddy comedy</em>   </p>
<p>Good Cop, Dog Cop,   </p>
<p><em>where I played a m*rder police officer</em>   </p>
<p><em>who is reincarnated as his partner's pet Saint Bernard.</em>   </p>
<p>Five smashed squad cars,     exploded helicopters, and the mayor's wife has fleas.   </p>
<p>Turn in your badge and your collar.   </p>
<p>You're suspended for a month!   </p>
<p>For me, that's like seven months.   </p>
<p>Dog Cop!   </p>
<p>[GRUNTING]   </p>
<p><em>KRUSTY: Suddenly, everyone in town</em>   </p>
<p><em>was dying to be in the Krusty business,</em>   </p>
<p><em>and I was dipping shrimp with all the big talents</em>   </p>
<p><em>I once longed to see fail.</em>   </p>
<p><em>And, of course, what the studio wanted most was a sequel.</em>   </p>
<p>Okay, Krusty, we've got   </p>
<p><em>Good Cop, Dog Cop  : Golden Revolver</em> all lined up.   </p>
<p>We, uh... who-who did the...   </p>
<p>The two Terrys, they just turned in a great script.   </p>
<p>Savage Sam Borgberg is all set to direct.   </p>
<p>So when do we start?   </p>
<p>I get it. You think I'm just some hack, out to churn out lazy sequels for a quick buck.   </p>
<p>Yes.   </p>
<p>This is my next movie.   </p>
<p><em>The Sands of Space?</em>   </p>
<p>Krusty, are you kidding me?   </p>
<p>This is the most famously un-filmable book in history.   </p>
<p>It made Kubrick a recluse. It-it drove Coppola to wine.   </p>
<p>The four Jeffs tried to write a script, but even they couldn't crack it.   </p>
<p>When I bought this at an adult bookstore by mistake, it changed my life.   </p>
<p>&quot;There's a light that shines from star to star, from soul to soul, connecting everyone in the universe.&quot;   </p>
<p>Wow.   </p>
<p>It's not landing for me that the hero doesn't refuse the quest before he accepts the quest.   </p>
<p>Is that landing for you?   </p>
<p>Look, I'm not drinking out of one more toilet until you green-light this movie.   </p>
<p>And I'm not playing a dog, either. [GRUNTS]   </p>
<p>All right, we got a comic who wants to make a hippie-dippie science-fiction vanity project.   </p>
<p>Here's what we do: we humor him, and we make it dirt cheap.   </p>
<p>We could sh**t it in Mexico for nothing.   </p>
<p>We hire a has-been to direct it and never-wases to do everything else.    </p>
<p>After it b*mb, that clown will come scooting his butt back here to make all the<em> Dog Cop</em> movies we want. Two more.    </p>
<p><em>KRUSTY: The Sands of Space was a go,</em>    </p>
<p><em>and the studio hired the least-qualified crew</em>    </p>
<p><em>they could find, including a young couple</em>    </p>
<p><em>whose love was just starting to bloom.</em>    </p>
<p><em>She was full of optimism,</em>    </p>
<p><em>and he was slightly less fat than he was going to be.</em>    </p>
<p>What could be cooler?    </p>
<p>You and me working on a movie together all summer long as production assistants.    </p>
<p>It's so romantic.    </p>
<p>We'll be like Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton if they had to get coffee for everybody.    </p>

<p>[BLOWS NOSE]    </p>
<p>Sir, I've worked in moving pictures since they were called &quot;stillies.&quot;    </p>
<p>I once sh*t a two-hour picture in    minutes.    </p>
<p>And so I say to you, in the words of Miss Lillian Gish, go crap in your hat.    </p>
<p>And now, if you'll excuse me, I am going to mysteriously drown in the ocean.    </p>
<p>As you may have heard, there's been an amicable parting of ways with that moron director. We wish him well.    </p>
<p>Clearly, there's only one artist close enough to this film    </p>
<p>- To direct it: me.<br />
- [ALL GASP]    </p>
<p>I know what you're thinking... have I taken on too much by starring and directing a movie that I was also tricked into cofinancing?    </p>
<p>No, because this story must be told.    </p>
<p>This is so exciting.    </p>
<p>Krusty's got the passion and vision to make this movie great.    </p>
<p><em>[SOBBING]</em>    </p>
<p><em>I have no idea how to make a movie.</em>    </p>
<p><em>I know nothing.</em>    </p>
<p><em>All these people are screwed.</em>    </p>
<p><em>And the crew gift is just a T-shirt.</em>    </p>
<p>Right, right, I-I get it.    </p>
<p>In the tradition of every actor ever, you thought you could direct.<br />
- Directing seemed so easy.    </p>
<p>You just hold your hands like this, then bing, bang, boom,    </p>
<p>Annie Leibovitz is taking your portrait in a bathtub full of milk.    </p>
<p>[LAUGHS] Yeah, talk about pressure, though.    </p>

<p>- feathers or scales?<br />
- I don't know, how about scales?    </p>
<p>Oh, well, there goes the whole costume budget.    </p>
<p>Uh, for the crew lunch, the grips want their hot dogs boiled, but the gaffers want them grilled.    </p>
<p>Either way, I don't got no hot dogs, so, uh, which is it?    </p>
<p>Do you want the space ship doors to open like, &quot;Zzztt-zzztt,&quot; &quot;ppswishh&quot; or &quot;wahh-wahh&quot;?    </p>
<p>Judd Nelson won't come out of his trailer.    </p>

<p>Wow, it's crazy, man, right?    </p>
<p>How narcissism and insecurity go hand in hand?    </p>
<p>I mean, you couldn't function because your assistant had a boyfriend.    </p>
<p>Where does that jealousy come from?    </p>
<p>How would I know? I fired my shrink after I found out she was seeing other patients. Anyway...    </p>

<p>Perfect. Let's get one more for safety.    </p>
<p>I'm telling you, your crazy boss is out to get me.    </p>
<p>No, he's not. Krusty loves our relationship.    </p>
<p>Every day, he says it would be a shame if something happened to you, then laughs and laughs.    </p>
<p>Then why are they sending me out to the middle of the desert to find a lizard for a new scene about a space lizard?    </p>
<p>Hmm, that does sound a little dangerous.    </p>
<p>No, I'm sure it's super safe.    </p>

<p>Yeah, get up, fat-ass.    </p>

<p>Oh, geez, I'm sorry, everyone.    </p>
<p>We don't have the cash to ransom that kid, but I think I know what he'd want: a special thanks in the closing credits right before which kind of film stock we used.    </p>
<p>Back to work.    </p>
<p>No. This crew looks after its own.    </p>
<p>We're gonna save Homer, and I don't care how much golden time they have to pay us.    </p>

<p>You're a good man, Krusty.    </p>
<p>Only when I'm with you, which is why I never want to see you again.    </p>
<p>I want that, too.    </p>
<p>I've done a lot of interviews, man, but wow.    </p>
<p>I-I am so glad that Byron Allen canceled.    </p>
<p>And after that, my movie career was kaput.    </p>

<p>We were just kids.    </p>
<p>What was it like?    </p>
<p>Well, working on that movie set turned out to be a lot like our marriage.    </p>
