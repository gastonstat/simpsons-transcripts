							<p>Milhouse, watch me make a loser lose it.</p>
<p>Oh, customers, how I hate them.</p>
<p><em>Excuse me. I just heard that before spider-man was a movie,</em> It was a comic book-- is that possible?</p>
<p>What the...? suffering steve ditko!</p>
<p>How can you not know that spider-man first appeared in 1962's classic <em>Amazing fantasy 15?!</em></p>
<p>Ooh, 12 cents!</p>
<p>I'll take eight.</p>
<p>What the...? You idiot! Mint condition copies are, like, $40,000 each!</p>
<p>Must lie down On pile of unsold hulk hands.</p>
<p>Hulk smash.</p>
<p>Huh? What's this?</p>
<p>&quot;everyman&quot;? He's not a hero from marvel, dc, Image or wildstorm.</p>
<p>&quot;it was a typical day For delivery man avery mann until...&quot;</p>
<p>Help! Bank robbers! Shut your yap.</p>
<p>Time for this average man to disappear.</p>
<p>Look at that fat guy-- b*at' it like an egg.</p>
<p>Yeah, he's scramblinin&quot; like an egg.</p>
<p>Egg. Egg.</p>
<p>Laugh while you can.</p>
<p>Everyman absorbs the powers of every superhero Whose comic book he touches.</p>
<p>Power-absorption power... Absorb!</p>
<p>It's just a flyin' fatso-- keep robbin'.</p>
<p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. put me in sing-sing! It's safer!</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Plastic man powers-- absorb!</p>
<p>Going somewhere?</p>
<p>Everyman will stop every crime every time.</p>
<p>And I... Am... Everyman.</p>
<p>Put my comic down.</p>
<p>You made this?! Shut up.</p>
<p>No one is interested in the critical judgment of a worthless child...</p>
<p>Actually, I like it.</p>
<p>You what now? <em>Everyman is awesome.</em></p>
<p>Reading it, I escaped from my troubles.</p>
<p>Now they're back in spades.</p>
<p>Have you shown this to anyone?</p>
<p>No. If copies got out, It would be ridiculed by the online community--</p>
<p>Sonofsonofspock, thedorkknight, and k*ll.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid of them. They're just lame-o's like yourself.</p>
<p>Two of them are me.</p>
<p>Very well. I... Shall... Self-publish.</p>
<p>How many issues have you written?</p>
<p>Oh, uh, just 335, including the controversial number 289, Featuring the death of marmaduke.</p>
<p>Comic book guy's been writing these for years.</p>
<p>Who knew a troubled person could be creative?</p>
<p>Yeah, still waters run deep.</p>
<p>I'm so rich.</p>
<p>All right, what's our next big summer franchise? Come on.</p>
<p>You want an original idea?</p>
<p>Yes. Let your imaginations run free.</p>
<p>Something that's never been a movie before, But feels like it has.</p>
<p>Extension cords. Mixed nuts.</p>
<p>Car keys.</p>
<p>Eh, we've already made everything That could possibly be a movie into a great movie.</p>
<p>There's nothin' left.</p>
<p>Dad, can we go?</p>
<p>I've watched all the dvds in the bentley.</p>
<p>Jonah, what's that in your hand?</p>
<p>Oh, big surprise that you don't know what this is.</p>
<p><em>It's only everyman, the coolest comic book ever.</em></p>
<p>What are his powers? All of them.</p>
<p>That's it. <em>Our next big summer movie will be everyman.</em></p>
<p>Uh, marv? Ginormous pictures bought the rights <em>To everyman three weeks ago.</em></p>
<p>Damn it!</p>
<p>We at ginormous pictures are incredible fans <em>And think everyman would make a fantastic movie.</em></p>
<p>Oh really? The way you thought &quot;stratego&quot; would make a good movie?</p>
<p>You'd expect us to believe That a red scout would date a blue general?</p>
<p>Hey, don't blame us-- brett ratner had final cut.</p>
<p>I'm well aware of who had what cut.</p>
<p>Let me get to the point: It is not money I am after, or women-- I know that is impossible.</p>
<p>What I want is to pick the actor who will play everyman.</p>
<p>No can do.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>But we never give... Thank you.</p>
<p>They'll laugh us out of hollywood. Thank you. fine. You got it. Thank you.</p>
<p>I played hardball with hollywood.</p>
<p>The closest I will ever come to playing a sport in my life.</p>
<p>&quot;Wherever there's a crime to be solved, I will be there to solve... it.&quot;</p>
<p>And there's more, but my fax machine ran out of ink, so I can't read it.</p>
<p>Do you know where you can buy ink for an amiga brand fax machine?</p>
<p>Thank you, that was great.</p>
<p>You want to see it any other way? Like sad...</p>
<p>Or brooklyn, or richard nixon voice?</p>
<p>Pass.</p>
<p>But I already bought a boat with the money you were gonna pay me.</p>
<p>Come on, comic book guy, you've gotta pick someone. We've already read three people.</p>
<p>Don't you latté-sipping leeches understand?</p>
<p>I've seen enough of these hollywood super-hunks.</p>
<p>We need a dumpy, unappealing loser. an everyman Can you help me out? I need change for a dollar.</p>
<p>Oh, I also need a dollar.</p>
<p>You... Are...</p>
<p>Acceptable.</p>
<p>Great. Do you want to see me naked?</p>
<p>Oh, there's no nudity in this movie. What movie?</p>
<p>Let's go around the table, and everybody say One amazing thing that happened to them today.</p>
<p>Lisa? Well, I qualified for the national math bee--</p>
<p>Great. Marge, go. Guess who the garden club Elected president? You? Awesome. Next.</p>
<p>No. I lost. Eh, they can go to hell. Bart?</p>
<p>Dr. Hibbert found out my thyroid isn't pumping out enough--</p>
<p>Time's up. Okay, maggie: &quot;suck, suck&quot;-- that takes us to... Me.</p>
<p>Some hollywood idiots hired me to star in a movie.</p>
<p>Homer, we have a problem.</p>
<p>Fine. I'll give back the oscars I stole from the lobby.</p>
<p>Do you want the golden globe? No! No...</p>
<p>But we have a bigger problem.</p>
<p>Homer, my brother and I showed this picture of you To a cross-section of typical moviegoers.</p>
<p>Not one thought you looked like a superhero.</p>
<p>Several people stared at the sun, Attempting to blind themselves. Against every animal instinct they had.</p>
<p>We need you to slim down, muscle up and become the everyman People want to be instead of the one they actually are.</p>
<p>I don't know if I can. I'm a yo-yo dieter: &quot;yo, hot dog man. Yo, peanuts.&quot;</p>
<p>Why aren't you laughing? Don't you know what &quot;yo&quot; means?</p>
<p>Maybe I can help.</p>
<p>Lyle mccarthy.</p>
<p>Finally, the answer to my problem.</p>
<p>What do you do? He's the trainer to the stars.</p>
<p>Here's what brad and angelina looked like before they met me.</p>
<p>They look good with a little meat on their bones.</p>
<p>Come with me. Take my hand, homer, And wave good-bye to fat you.</p>
<p>Good-bye, fat me.</p>
<p>You sure that guy who created everyman's gonna like this?</p>
<p>Him? He's gone hollywood.</p>

<p>...A lot of people have come to this town and changed, But not me.</p>
<p>Now excuse me, I have to read a story To my adopted cambodian orphan.</p>
<p>Nannies, produce the child and the story.</p>
<p>Hello, prius-- give daddy a kiss.</p>
<p>Homer, do you know why you eat?</p>
<p>Because I'm swallowing my frustrations and disappointments?</p>
<p>Something bad happens and you cope by cramming a donut in your mouth.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you don't always have time to...</p>
<p>I'm gonna teach you Healthy emotional alternatives to eating.</p>
<p>We don't have much time, So we'll do it in a montage to the song &quot;eye of the tiger.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, that song's a little on the nose.</p>
<p>Can we do it to david bowie's &quot;heroes&quot;?</p>
<p>Eh, it's your montage.</p>
<p>Whew... This montage sounds really exhausting.</p>
<p>How about I just do a walking around sad montage?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>A montage of me turning a ragtag little league team into state runners-up?</p>
<p>No. Me using funny modes of transportation Like a hot air balloon and a camel, And finally a pickup truck full of chickens?</p>
<p>Then I get out of the truck and go to thank the driver, But then I see the driver is a chicken? Let's just skip ahead a month.</p>
<p>10,001... 10,002...</p>
<p>And... Fit.</p>
<p>I gotta take this.</p>
<p><em>Tobey! Cider house rules!</em></p>
<p>Total wuss.</p>
<p>Seabiscuit, you keeping off the sugar cubes?</p>
<p><em>I hate this guy.</em></p>
<p>I love this guy!</p>
<p>Tobe, tobe, tobe, we talked about this.</p>
<p>If the rice ain't brown, don't chow down.</p>
<p>Look, I gotta bail-- I'm with everyman right now.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, don't worry.</p>
<p>He totally sucks.</p>
<p>I'm only lying to him.</p>
<p>Good-bye! Bad-bye.</p>
<p>Was that tobey maguire?</p>
<p>Hey, home town buffet, like I told john travolta, my client list is private.</p>
<p>You know what? Enough chitchat.</p>
<p>Hit the pole! Stripper up...Fireman down.</p>
<p>And sexy. Heroic!</p>
<p>Earn that money.</p>
<p>Found this on the roof.</p>
<p>Well, I think we've seen the last of the purple pariah.</p>
<p>Thanks, everyman. <em>Don't thank me.</em></p>
<p>Thank captain america For giving me the patriotism <em>to want to save the president's life.</em></p>
<p>And thank wonder woman for giving me the boobs to distract the guards.</p>
<p>And... Cut.</p>
<p>What'd you think, kids? That was awesome!</p>
<p>Although there were a few holes in the story.</p>
<p>That's the problem when you have 17 writers.</p>
<p>But don't worry, we have two fresh ones working on it.</p>
<p>Ooh, homie, take your shirt off again.</p>
<p>Oh! There's less of you to love, But I love you even more!</p>
<p>Aah! What was that? Your other hand.</p>
<p>Cut! Terrific. Bring in the next helicopter.</p>
<p>Awesome performance, homer. I smell oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar, take a shower, or a tomato bath or something. Please!</p>
<p>This life is the greatest--</p>
<p>I get paid a fortune, I've got a closet full of free sneakers and watches, And I get to hire my friends.</p>
<p>At least you get to see my face-- unlike carl.</p>
<p>I'm being paid to do what I love!</p>
<p>A lot of things come and go in life, But not fame and fitness.</p>
<p>Homer! Homer sapian, can I have a word with you? I know this is a bad time, but but I'm leaving for another gig.</p>
<p>Is that all this temporary job was to you, a gig? Don't take it personally, home team.</p>
<p>But how will I keep from overeating?</p>
<p>Just remember what I taught you.</p>
<p>But you taught me the only people who can stay thin Are those who can afford $5,000-a-week nutritional consultants!</p>
<p>I've taught you well. Good-bye.</p>
<p>He's gone.</p>
<p>One cheese cube couldn't hurt.</p>
<p>Ooh! This other cheese cube stuck to the first one.</p>
<p>Well, that still technically counts as one.</p>
<p>Mm, it's bad luck to eat an uneven number of cheese cubes.</p>
<p>Don't look at me!</p>
<p>Don't look at me!</p>
<p>You, you watch.</p>
<p>Avery, I swear, you're the only man in gothamopolis Who's never seen everyman.</p>
<p>Well, one thing's for sure: <em>I'm not everyman.</em> cut!</p>
<p>This is a disaster. I'm getting a bad feeling about this film.</p>
<p>The star's overweight, we're way over budget, And the grasshopperaptor we built Seems to have developed an evil mind of its own.</p>
<p>Oh, marge, I'm ready for some lovin'.</p>
<p>Come and get me!</p>
<p>Marge! Speak to me! I think you may have put on a little weight.</p>
<p>Nag, nag, nag!</p>
<p>Apu, I have to lose weight now. Do you have anything that'll make me vomit?</p>
<p>Well, I don't know, I...</p>
<p>Might have some milk that has expired.</p>
<p>Ah, here we are. A delightful buttermilk from 1961.</p>
<p>Oh, '61-- everyone was twisting again like they did the previous summer.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, do not chew the chunks.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Cleanup in aisles in three, Two, one...</p>
<p>And... Action!</p>
<p>Ugh. What? Cut.</p>
<p>Where's homer? In his trailer.</p>
<p><em>He won't come out? He can't come out.</em></p>
<p>This film is an embarrassment of jar-jarrian magnitude!</p>
<p>As the writer, I demand to express my opinion.</p>
<p>Ooh, I'm afraid that's not gonna happen.</p>
<p>I see. Well, I respect that... And vulcan death Hollywood ponytail yank!</p>
<p>My only sin was believing in george clooney!</p>
<p>How you doing, man?</p>
<p>Ooh, I think we have a clunker here.</p>
<p><em>And I should know-- I produced bad summer movie,</em> The parody of bad summer movies that was itself a bad summer movie.</p>
<p>Don't worry, we fixed everything with editing.</p>
<p>Editing solves everything-- except my problems with the irs.</p>
<p>Yeah, how's that going?</p>
<p>Everyman... Show your-ssself.</p>
<p>I'm right here. I've been here all along.</p>
<p>Half the shots he's fat, half the shots he's thin--It's taking me out of the moment.</p>
<p>Like when you're kissing a girl, and she burps.</p>
<p>Who was in charge of continuity on this picture?</p>
<p>I tried to show them the polaroids-- they wouldn't look.</p>
<p>It's your job to get their attention.</p>
<p>Nobody takes responsibility anymore.</p>
<p>Well, I-I just wanted to get back into the business after I had my kids.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, now those kids have an embarrassment for a mother.</p>
<p>Home boy. What happened, dude?</p>
<p>You went from everyman to everywhereman.</p>
<p>What happened is, you left! Who did you leave me for?</p>
<p>Tell me-- I can take it.</p>
<p><em>Okay! It was turtle from entourage.</em></p>
<p>I knew it!</p>
<p>Come on, home run. It's okay, home alone.</p>
<p>Look, I'm sorry. Let me make this up to you--</p>
<p>I'll train you, Then leave you again, then come back and train you. It's how I make my money.</p>
<p>Just you and me?</p>
<p>You, me and turtle.</p>
<p>That could work.</p>
<p>He is a great guy. He's an awful guy.</p>
<p><em>You just said both those things to me.</em></p>
<p>I'm sorry. I'm not sorry.</p>
<p>Look, comic book guy, about the movie, We know it's not great.</p>
<p>Yeah, the projectionist hung himself at the final reel.</p>
<p>But you created everyman--your fans will think whatever you tell 'em.</p>
<p>If you put the word out that this movie is good, We'll let you direct the sequel.</p>
<p>You would let me direct Everyman 2: Rise of the revenge?</p>
<p>Absolutely! All you have to do Is tell your army of internet dweebs to go see this movie.</p>
<p>Hmm, sell my soul for hollywood lucre, Or stay true to my lofty ideals.</p>
<p><em>Everyman, the motion picture,</em> Is the combination of a life-long dream, And I was one of the few who saw that dream realized on screen last night.</p>
<p>If there is one fault to find with this $200 million production, It is that this is the worst movie ever!</p>
<p>And send! And sip.</p>
<p>Though legislation was passed to ensure everyman was never seen on screens again <em>He remains in the hearts of every man, woman and child</em></p>
<p>Looking for justice, or just hoping to see bad people b*at up.</p>
<p>I'm so cold.</p>
