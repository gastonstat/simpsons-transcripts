<p>Oh, they're gonna eat this up in show-and-tell.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with the idea... of your classmates laughing at our family's private moments.</p>
<p>How would you like it if 20 years from now... people were laughing at things you did?</p>
<p>Not likely. Come on. Have a sense of humor about yourself.</p>
<p>I'm a big boy today.</p>
<p>[ Laughing ]</p>
<p>[ Groans ] I gotta find something else quick.</p>
<p>Why don't you bring this potato? It's pretty big.</p>
<p>Mom, you're always trying to give me potatoes.</p>
<p>What is it with you?</p>
<p>I just think they're neat.</p>
<p>I need something for show-and-tell.</p>
<p>Just take one of my geodes.</p>
<p>The rocks on my desk.</p>
<p>No, that's a trilobite.</p>
<p>That's petrified wood.</p>
<p>Bart, that's a bran muffin.!</p>
<p>[ School Bus Horn Honks ]</p>
<p>Greetings, fellow geode-ologist.</p>
<p>[ Groans ] I'll be right back!</p>
<p>[ Santa's Little Helper Growling ]</p>
<p>The ingredients were fresh pureed tomatoes... water, salt and sodium benzoate used to retard spoilage.</p>
<p>Once again, if I'm not mistaken... this can contained tomato paste.</p>
<p>Thank you, Nelson. I look forward to seeing it again next week.</p>
<p>Bart,you're up.</p>
<p>Boys and girls, Mrs. Krabappel...</p>
<p>I come before you today to solve a riddle... that has plagued mankind for centuries.</p>
<p>What has four legs and ticks?</p>
<p>A walking clock?</p>
<p>A walking clock!</p>
<p>I'd wager he has some variety of walking clock in that box.</p>
<p>Bart, is it a walking clock?</p>
<p>What? No, it's my dog.</p>
<p>[ All Gasp ]</p>
<p>Oh, he is a gem!</p>
<p>Here, boy. Would you like these cookies Martin made for me?</p>
<p>My raisin roundies!</p>
<p>My dog's name is Santa's Little Helper.</p>
<p>One time he crawled under the house, and when he came out, he was covered with ants.</p>
<p>Then he ran into a church and drank all the holy water.</p>
<p>[ All ] Wow!</p>
<p>Thank you, Bart. Great job.</p>
<p>[ All Cheering ]</p>
<p>I knew the dog before he came to class.</p>
<p>Kaboom! That, the sound of the thunderous volcanic expl*si*n... which gives birth to the magnificent geode, one of nature's most--</p>
<p>You're doing it wrong.! You gotta pet him hard so he can feel it.</p>
<p>[ Grumbles, Sneezes ]</p>
<p>Look, look, look! The doggy sneezed!</p>
<p>Ha! It thinks it's people.</p>
<p>[ Knocking ]</p>
<p>Oh, smoochie. Here, poochie, poochie, poochie!</p>
<p>[ Grunts ]</p>
<p>[ Clears Throat ]</p>
<p>My geode must be acknowledged.</p>
<p>Oh, brother. All right. Back to show-and-tell.</p>
<p>Bart, why don't you put the doggy away?</p>
<p>[ Students Groaning ]</p>
<p>[ Whimpers ]</p>
<p>[ Sniffing ]</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>More testicles mean more iron.</p>
<p>[ Moaning, Whimpering ]</p>
<p>Uh, Miss Hoover, there's a dog in the vent.</p>
<p>Ralph, remember the time you said Snagglepuss was outside?</p>
<p>He was going to the bathroom.</p>
<p>Uh, I-I know Weinstein's parents were upset, Superintendent... but I-I was sure it was a phony excuse.</p>
<p>I mean, it sounds so made-up. &quot;Yom Kip Pur.&quot;</p>
<p>I mean, it sounds so made-up. &quot;Yom Kip Pur.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir, you've got to come quick!</p>
<p>There's a dog runnin' around in the air ducts!</p>
<p>I understand. Children, this is Principal Skinner.</p>
<p>Remain calm. There is a dog in the vents.</p>
<p>[ Shouting, Cheering ]</p>
<p>[ Grunts ]</p>
<p>[ Slobbers, Panting ]</p>
<p>Willie, go into the vent and get him!</p>
<p>What? Have you gone waxy in your &quot;beester&quot;?</p>
<p>I cannot fit in the wee vent, ya croquet-playin' mint muncher!</p>
<p>Grease yourself up and go in, you-- you guff-speaking work slacker.</p>
<p>Ooh, good comeback.</p>
<p>Lunch Lady Doris, have you got any grease?</p>
<p>Yes. Yes, we do.</p>
<p>Then grease me up, woman!</p>
<p>Okeydokey.</p>

<p>[ Laughing Continues ]</p>
<p>[ Students Shouting ]</p>
<p>Ow! Ow! Stop it!</p>
<p>Children, teachers, back to your rooms.</p>
<p>Uh-oh. Whenever I get this upset, I get hiccups.</p>
<p>[ Hiccups ] Oh, right on cue.</p>
<p>[ All Laughing ]</p>
<p>[ Barks ]</p>
<p>[ Grunts, Groans ]</p>
<p>[ Grunts, Laughs ]</p>
<p>There's nary an animal alive that can outrun a greased Scotsman.</p>
<p>Now, out we go. [ Grunts ]</p>
<p>[ Gasps ]</p>
<p>'Tis more dizzyin' than the belfry at St. Corgegluynwaagen's.</p>
<p>[ Students Murmuring ]</p>
<p>That's nice work, boys.</p>
<p>[ Panting ]</p>
<p>[ Mrs. Krabappel ] Uh-oh.!</p>
<p>Someone's getting a visit from Superintendent Chalmers.</p>
<p>I... [ Hiccups ] can't... [ Hiccups ] take... [ Hiccups ] this. [ Hiccups ]</p>
<p>Skinner!</p>
<p>Superintendent Chalmers... you didn't have to come all the way down here.</p>
<p>Everything's under control.</p>
<p>[ Screams ]</p>
<p>Oh, I have had it! I have had it with this school, Skinner!</p>
<p>The low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children!</p>
<p>Oh, now I really think the children's appearance--</p>
<p>Seymour,you are in very, very big trouble.</p>
<p>[ Barks ]</p>
<p>[ Gasps ]</p>
<p>Why, looking into this loveable mutt's eyes just melts my heart.</p>
<p>Seymour, all is forgiven.</p>
<p>[ Yelling ] Make way for Willie.!</p>
<p>I said make way for Willie, ya bloated gasbag!</p>
<p>Seymour.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>You're fired!</p>
<p>[ Gasps ]</p>
<p>I'm sorry. Did-- Did you just call me a liar?</p>
<p>No. I said you were fired.</p>
<p>Oh. That's much worse.</p>
<p>[ Hiccups ]</p>
<p>[ Gobbling, Gulping ]</p>
<p>I thought I'd be jumping for joy the day Skinner left... but now all I have is this weird, hot feeling in the back of my head.</p>
<p>That's guilt. You feel guilty because your stunt wound up costing a man his job.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess it is guilt.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me get this straight.</p>
<p>They let everybody out of school early just because you brought a dog?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, but--</p>
<p>Well, I'm off to work.</p>
<p>The dog has had enough excitement.</p>
<p>But, Marge... dogs can never have enough excitement.</p>
<p>Look. Whee! Whee! [ Laughing ]</p>
<p>Whee, whee! [ Laughing ]</p>
<p>All right, all right. I won't take the dog. Come here.</p>
<p>[ Groans ]</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>Boys and girls, because of Mr. Skinner's sudden departure...</p>
<p>I've had to appoint a new principal.</p>
<p>Leopold.</p>
<p>[ All Gasp ]</p>
<p>All right, you little punks. Prick up your freakin' ears... because I'm only gonna be saying this once.</p>
<p>From now on, things are gonna be very, very different around here--</p>
<p>[ All Gasp ] with your new principal, Ned Flanders.</p>
<p>[ Applause, Cheering ]</p>
<p>Well, tippity-top o' the a.m. to every-good-body here.</p>
<p>As chairman of the P.T.A., I am de-didilly-lighted to take over... and I think I can put the &quot;pal&quot; back in principal.</p>
<p>[ All Laughing ]</p>
<p>Yeah, and I'll put the &quot;super&quot; back in superintendent.</p>
<p>[ Someone Coughs ]</p>
<p>It's the same exact joke. What gives, Leo?</p>
<p>Now, I know everybody's eager to get back to class--</p>
<p>[ Mrs. Krabappel ] Ha.! but I thought it might break the ice if we had a little &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;A.&quot;</p>
<p>Dude, ask a question, or we'll have to go back to class.</p>
<p>Um--</p>
<p>Yeah, you.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, I was wonderin', do you, uh--</p>
<p>What's your policy on, uh, lunch?</p>
<p>Well, let me just say I want to put the &quot;stu&quot; back in students.</p>
<p>[ All Laughing ]</p>
<p>It's just a damn popularity contest with you kids.</p>
<p>Now look what you've done, you little freaks!</p>
<p>Young man, your gargantuan cone... is making a mockery of our self-serve policy.</p>
<p>Bart, look. It's Principal Skinner... and I think he's gone crazy.</p>
<p>He's not wearing a suit or tie or anything.</p>
<p>Principal Skinner, um...</p>
<p>I'm real sorry about my dog getting you fired... and biting you and then getting it on with your leg.</p>
<p>Well, maybe it was for the best.</p>
<p>Now I-- I finally have time to do what I've always wanted-- write the great American novel.</p>
<p>Mine is about a futuristic amusement park... where dinosaurs are brought to life through advanced cloning techniques.</p>
<p>I call it Billy and the Clone-osaurus.</p>
<p>Oh, you have got to be kidding, sir.</p>
<p>First you think of an idea that has already been done.</p>
<p>Then you give it a title that nobody could possibly like. Didn't you think this through?</p>
<p>...on the best-seller list for I 8 months!</p>
<p>Every magazine cover had it!</p>
<p>...most popular movies of all time, sir!</p>
<p>What were you thinking?</p>
<p>I mean, thank you. Come again.</p>
<p>Bart, I've barely been here a-a good solid week... and you've been sent to my office I 1 times.</p>
<p>Now that I have peanut butter cups, you seem to be getting in trouble every hour.</p>
<p>Must have been a coincidence.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, Bart, you're gonna have to be punished.</p>
<p>This isn't just some sort of clubhouse.</p>
<p>[ Ice Rattles ]</p>
<p>Oh, sorry. Were you drinking Slice or Yoo-hoo?</p>
<p>Well, let's see. &quot;Tide. Cheer. Bold. Biz. Fab. All. Gain. Wisk.&quot;</p>
<p>I believe today I will try... Bold.</p>
<p>Bart, how are you? How's school?</p>
<p>Um, it's-- it's a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Well, it was good to see you.</p>
<p>It was? Well, then we should get together again.</p>
<p>Say, Saturday at my house. Do you know where I live?</p>
<p>Uh, no.</p>
<p>Hmm. A flaming bag, eh?</p>
<p>Well, these new ltalian loafers will make short work of it.</p>
<p>Uh, I'm kinda busy on Saturday.</p>

<p>[ Chanting ] We got Skinner's underpants!</p>
<p>And there's nothing you can do about it, Mr. Ex-principal.</p>

<p>Uh, I'll pass. Hey, what's this?</p>
<p>Oh, that's my old unit from Vietnam.</p>
<p>I was their sergeant. They were my loyal troops.</p>

<p>It's good to have another combat veteran around here.</p>
<p>I myself received a number of medals... for securing that Montgomery Ward in Kuwait City.</p>

<p>Oh, man! Ned spilled ink all over my poems!</p>
<p>He's a real flat tire. I mean a cube, man.</p>
<p>He's putting us on the train to Squaresville, Mona.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>♪ I met a woman in Paris, France ♪<br />
♪ Had a big hole in her underpants ♪</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait. Where did you pick up that filth?</p>
<p>We heard Sergeant Clark's company singing it, sir.</p>
<p>Yes, well, there will be no smut in my company.</p>
<p>You're in this man's army to learn.</p>
<p>♪ I don't know, but I've been told ♪<br />
♪ The Parthenon is mighty old ♪<br />
♪ How old ♪<br />
♪ We don't know ♪<br />
♪ That's real good but needs improvement ♪</p>
<p>[ Sighs ]</p>
<p>Wow, I never thought Principal Skinner could become any more of a square... but there's the proof.</p>
<p>It's weird, Lise.</p>
<p>I miss him as a friend, but I miss him even more as an enemy.</p>
<p>I think you need Skinner, Bart. Everybody needs a nemesis.</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes had his Dr. Moriarty.</p>
<p>Mountain Dew has its Mello Yello.</p>
<p>Even Maggie has that baby with the one eyebrow.</p>

<p>If there was some way to get rid of Flanders, would you want to come back?</p>
<p>Ah, I must admit I do miss the school.</p>
<p>Frankly, the army isn't quite as I remembered it.</p>
<p>Up yours, Sergeant!</p>
<p>Actually, it's exactly as I remembered it.</p>
<p>I do want to come back, Bart... but it doesn't sound like Flanders is gonna get fired.</p>
<p>Oh, I think I could get him fired.</p>
<p>I got you fired, didn't I? [ Laughing ]</p>
<p>Yes. Now, you realize if I become principal again... we can no longer be friends, unless you become a good student.</p>
<p>Hmm. That's probably never gonna happen.</p>
<p>Well, we'll always have the Laundromat.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What's he doing here?</p>
<p>Once he found out we were gonna get Ned Flanders fired, he insisted on helping.</p>
<p>Once he found out we were gonna get Ned Flanders fired, he insisted on helping.</p>
<p>That is true.</p>
<p>Here's the plan.</p>
<p>Once Chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten... he'll fire Ned on the spot.</p>
<p>Uh, one question remains: How do I get out of the army?</p>
<p>No problemo.Just make a pass at your commanding officer.</p>
<p>Done and done. And I mean done.</p>

<p>Come on, Chalmie. You fired Skinner for less than this.</p>
<p>Yeah, I did, but Skinner really bugged me.</p>
<p>Besides, the way America's public schools are sliding... they'll all be this way in a few months.</p>
<p>I say lay back and enjoy it. It's a hell of a toboggan ride.</p>
<p>[ Ned On Speaker ] Well, k*ll, little buddies.</p>
<p>Let's thank the Lord for another beautiful school day.</p>
<p>Thank the Lor-- Thank the Lord? That sounded like a prayer.</p>
<p>A prayer! A prayer in a public school!</p>
<p>God has no place within these walls... just like facts have no place within organized religion!</p>
<p>Simpson, you get your wish. Flanders is history.</p>

<p>Well, I really enjoyed my time here, Superintendent.</p>
<p>May the Lord bless and keep you.</p>
<p>Yeah, take it outside, God boy.</p>

<p>You really think it's a good idea to give that freak his job back?</p>
