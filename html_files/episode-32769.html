<p>Oh, I could dissolve that union as easily as the tea dissolves this sugar.    </p>
<p>Smithers, did you see him heft that sugar cube?    </p>
<p>Did I.    </p>
<p>Monty, I can break up that couple, and I'd wager five million on it.    </p>

<p>Well, thank you.    </p>
<p>Methinks I see my opportunity.    </p>
<p>Why are you telling me?    </p>
<p>I always considered us friends.    </p>
<p>So, let... Uh, what's your name there?    </p>
<p>Brant... Brant here pour something for you.    </p>
<p>We got loads of microbrew with crazy names, like, uh, Hops-along Cassidy and Michelob.    </p>
<p>So, uh, where's Homer?    </p>
<p>We're not spending as much time together.    </p>

<p>Hey, Stogie, how about a little &quot;Moonglow&quot;?    </p>
<p>Not the real moon.    </p>
<p>Oh, you mean the drug.    </p>
<p>No, the song.    </p>
<p>(&quot;MOONGLOW&quot; PLAYING)    </p>
<p>&quot;Moonglow,&quot; that's my favorite song.    </p>
<p>Yeah, you came into my bar seven years ago    </p>
<p>and you played it on the jukebox.    </p>
<p>I remember things like that.    </p>
<p>So, you want to dance?    </p>
<p>I actually do it a lot, but, uh, nobody sees behind the bar.    </p>
<p>I guess one dance couldn't hurt.    </p>
<p>So, can you start Monday?    </p>
<p>Oh, you won't break up the Simpsons.    </p>
<p>I'm not used to getting my arms all the way around someone.    </p>
<p>Oh, God, I can't work for a man I'm not in love with.    </p>
<p><em>I've got to fix this now.</em>    </p>
<p>Simpson, you need to patch things up with your wife now.    </p>
<p>We're fine. Excuse me, bartender?    </p>
<p>I ordered three dozen wings and I only count   .    </p>
<p>Listen to me, this was gonna be a birthday present for my mother, but I want you to give it to Marge.    </p>
<p>Okay, what's the gag?    </p>
<p>You have to reconcile with your wife.    </p>
<p>Mm, there's always a catch.    </p>
<p>I've seen a whole different side of you tonight, Moe.    </p>
<p>MOE:<em> Whoa, she's waving me home</em>    </p>
<p><em>like a third-base coach.</em>    </p>
<p><em>But could I really do that to Homer?</em>    </p>
<p><em>Damn it, I need time to think here.</em>    </p>
<p>Sorry, this is great, but I got to go stick plastic ribbons onto toothpicks.    </p>
<p>That don't just happen.    </p>
<p>If Moe can change, why can't my husband?    </p>
<p>Well, um, seems to me the reason your husband won't change is 'cause he knows he's got a great thing with you.    </p>
<p>If he suddenly treated you different, that should worry you.    </p>
<p>I mean, duh, I guess.    </p>
<p>You know? Duh?    </p>
<p>- Hey, Marge.<br />
- Homie!    </p>
<p>I got you something.    </p>
<p>(SOBBING)    </p>
<p>What the...?    </p>
<p>That's not from you.    </p>
<p>Can't you at least open it so I can find out what it is?    </p>
<p>Marge, I got the best gift I ever got you in my life.    </p>
<p>Huh?    </p>
<p>- (GROANS)<br />
- Okay, that's not great.    </p>
<p>And why, if you were trying to be close, would you spend the whole evening away from me?    </p>
<p>Hey, you've taken me off the market since I was   ,  which I immediately regret saying.    </p>
<p>Look, I'm on my knees.    </p>
<p>Why aren't you forgiving me?    </p>
<p>I'll follow you.    </p>
<p>Ow, hairbrush.    </p>
<p>Ow, alphabet blocks.    </p>
<p>Ow, dog toy!    </p>
<p>(MURMURING): Wasn't even a card for me.    </p>
<p>(HOMER GRUNTING)    </p>
