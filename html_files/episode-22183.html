<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>(SCREAMING) (BRAKES SCREECHING)</p>
<p>Let's see... I'll have 16 Gravy Scrape 'Ems, a bucket of Twisty Lard, and two Super Choker Breakfast Burritos with macho sauce.</p>
<p>And mega-size it, please.</p>
<p>SQUEAKY-VOICED TEEN: I could also deep-fry the bag.</p>
<p>Great. And I'll have a Diet Coke deep-fried.</p>
<p>Mmm! Mmm!</p>
<p>Need more lap.</p>
<p>(GULPING)</p>
<p>(Otto) Whoa!</p>
<p>I can't see! I'll have to steer by the reflection in my watch!</p>
<p>(TIRES SCREECHING) Oh!</p>
<p>Why don't I just pull over?</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p>Can't stop. Krusty collectible toy jammed under brake pedal!</p>
<p>Hey-hey! Hey-hey! Hey-hey!</p>
<p>(Automated Voice) intruder detected. Calling local police.</p>
<p>(DIALING)</p>
<p>Line busy, shutting down.</p>
<p>Mr. Burns, the Department of Nuclear Security is very impressed with your plant.</p>
<p>Yes. We're well protected against every threat, from b*mb Bolsheviks to golden-armed jazzbos.</p>
<p>(THUDDING)</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Oh, no! I hit the grief counselor!</p>
<p>Promise me you'll report this.</p>
<p>Consider yourself fired!</p>
<p>I had a car!</p>
<p>Mom, can we go into this bookstore?</p>
<p>Please, please, please, please, please, please, please?</p>
<p>Well, I could use a muffin.</p>
<p>(MARGE HUMMING)</p>
<p>I'm gonna go up to the fourth floor where the books are.</p>
<p>I'm gonna taunt the PhD's.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>I heard an assistant professorship just opened up.</p>
<p>(ALL GASPING) Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>At the University of... Psych!</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>(GASPING)</p>
<p>Esme Delacroix? She wrote To Kiss a Scoundrel.</p>
<p>&quot;And they tumbled to the heather,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;breeches to bustle, crinoline to burlap,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;their mansion in ashes, their passion aflame.&quot;</p>
<p>End of Chapter 1.</p>
<p>Yeah, when it happens in a book, it's romantic.</p>
<p>But when Willie tries to kiss ya, you're all pepper spray and fingernails.</p>
<p>(CLEARS THROAT) Marge Simpson, long-time reader, first-time stander-upper.</p>
<p>Did you have any special training to become a writer?</p>
<p>(SCOFFS) Just a class at the Y. Yale University.</p>
<p>But anyone with passion can write.</p>
<p>Anyone?</p>
<p>If I write a book, will they tell me when it comes out?</p>
<p>Well, they should, yes.</p>
<p>Then I'll do it!</p>
<p>I gotta get a job before Marge finds out I was fired.</p>
<p>That's it!</p>
<p>I'll steal the sign and they'll pay me to make them a new one!</p>
<p>I'll show you what we do with scammers like you.</p>
<p>Okay, here's how it goes.</p>
<p>Buyers never tell you what they're willing to spend.</p>
<p>And when they talk privately, we spy on them through this one-way mirror.</p>
<p>We'll clean out those stupid Americans.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING)</p>
<p>You'll probably want to talk this over so I'll leave you two &quot;alone.&quot;</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING EVILLY)</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Well, honey, what do you think?</p>
<p>Did that salesman cut one during the test drive?</p>
<p>Yeah. And for some reason he turned on the radio to cover up the smell.</p>
<p>Let's get out of here. I'm not shaking that guy's hand.</p>
<p>They'll be back.</p>
<p>(b*at MUSIC PLAYING)</p>
<p>(MOANS)</p>
<p>He was my best friend.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Cool. An ambulance from the '60s.</p>
<p>I bet a lot of hippies were denied care in this thing.</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Injured hippies.</p>
<p>No, we'll never sell this thing.</p>
<p>The brakes are sh*t, the engine's rusted.</p>
<p>The only thing that works is the siren.</p>
<p>(BLARING)</p>
<p>(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Buy me! Buy me! Buy me!</p>
<p>Buy me! I'll do it!</p>
<p>Do what?</p>
<p>(SIREN BLARING)</p>
<p>Guess what? I quit my job as a used car salesman.</p>
<p>You work at the Nuclear Plant.</p>
<p>Get with the program, Marge. Your husband is now an ambulance driver.</p>
<p>Don't you need training for that?</p>
<p>Maybe on Planet ZooZoo.</p>
<p>Hey, I think it's cool. I can defibrillate Lisa!</p>
<p>Not if I pump your heart full of morphine first!</p>
<p>Kids, kids. Those aren't your toys.</p>
<p>They're to keep Daddy asleep and awake.</p>
<p>I'm gonna need them on my first shift tonight.</p>
<p>Tonight? But I was hoping you could watch the kids while I work on my novel.</p>
<p>Slow down, Picasso. You were gonna start a novel without informing me?</p>
<p>Homer, you left two jobs and bought an ambulance without even a phone call!</p>
<p>I also fed some ducklings.</p>
<p>I know. I got your message.</p>
<p>Fine, fine.</p>
<p>I'll take the kids tonight and you go to your precious hair appointment.</p>
<p>I'm writing a novel!</p>
<p>Whatever. But I think you look great already.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>What should I write about?</p>
<p>That painting has always sparked my imagination.</p>
<p>That's it! A novel about whaling!</p>
<p>That's something you haven't seen before.</p>
<p>Thank you, Scene From Moby-Dick.</p>
<p>&quot;Chapter 1, starts and beginnings.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;'Swim, swim, swim, ' thought the whale, flapping his flappers.&quot;</p>
<p>Brownie break!</p>
<p>&quot;Mayor Quimby, Disco Stu,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;and our fighting men and women overseas.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, I've finished the thank you's.</p>
<p>Time to go back to the novel.</p>
<p>Temperance Barrows stared at the sea, like a dog stares at a ham.</p>
<p>Oh, I just finished my first paragraph.</p>
<p>Spell-check! Perfect.</p>
<p>Now let's see if lightning strikes twice.</p>
<p>Where to, Mac?</p>
<p>For the third time, the hospital.</p>
<p>You're an ambulance, not a taxi.</p>
<p>Hospital, eh? Wow! Everyone's going there tonight.</p>
<p>(SIREN WAILING)</p>
<p>Dad, you've been driving in circles for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Why don't you just admit you don't know where the hospital is?</p>
<p>Why don't you admit I know it's around here somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: &quot;For Temperance, the days passed on&quot;, &quot;as did seven of her 10 children.&quot;</p>
<p>When will father return from his whaling voyage?</p>
<p>This family has not seen whale meat for a one month.</p>
<p>Bartaby, Leezakiah, we must be grateful for what we have.</p>
<p>Family, the good Lord has blessed my voyage.</p>
<p>Behold his bounty.</p>
<p>And for you, good wife, Virginia's miracle crop, tobacco.</p>
<p>Ohhh! It has colored my teeth a healthy brown.</p>
<p>Was there ever a more perfect husband than you?</p>
<p>(CAR DOOR SLAMMING)</p>
<p>Marge, I'm back.</p>
<p>Oh, Homie, I've had the most exciting day.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. I need some dinner stat.</p>
<p>And the kids need some CPR lessons.</p>
<p>We're not paramedics!</p>
<p>I'll say.</p>
<p>Oh, good. You can use that to take down my dinner order.</p>
<p>I'll start with the soup, then a nice mixed grill with a side of wild rice.</p>
<p>Fine! Right after this revision.</p>
<p>&quot;Temperance had to face the unhappy truth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She had married a brute.&quot;</p>
<p>Hey, baby! I've returned from Portsmouth.</p>
<p>Now let me put my tongue down &quot;yourmouth.&quot;</p>
<p>Ugh!</p>
<p>Now cook up my catch.</p>
<p>A seagull?</p>
<p>The whales weren't biting, okay?</p>
<p>I know you did your best.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. You know everything, don't you?</p>
<p>Now, don't wait up. I'll be at Moab's.</p>
<p>This story is as dark as those new Milky Way bars.</p>
<p>That's a good analogy. I'll work it in somewhere.</p>
<p>But now I need some romance pronto.</p>
<p>Hey, Marge.</p>
<p>You look like you could use a nice, big stud detector.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING) They were two-for-one at Krusty Home Depot.</p>
<p>So I got an extra one for you guys.</p>
<p>Ned, that's so considerate.</p>
<p>Well, some say being thoughtful is old-fashioned.</p>
<p>If so, then I guess I'm just a caveman, if they existed, which they didn't.</p>
<p>Boy, when you write, you can let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p>&quot;Temperance was doing the laundry.&quot;</p>
<p>(Cyrus) My, those are pretty calluses.</p>
<p>And your back has a nice New England hump.</p>
<p>I'm Cyrus Manley. And I'm new to the island.</p>
<p>Perhaps you could show me around.</p>
<p>Nantucket is an island?</p>
<p>What do you know? It is.</p>
<p>Well, I could take you on a tour, as long as my husband doesn't need me.</p>
<p>Hey, baby. I know we work together.</p>
<p>But I think you're hot.</p>
<p>(BOTTLE BREAKING)</p>
<p>Let's go!</p>
<p>I've never met a man like you.</p>
<p>You listen to what I say, your body has known the cleansing touch of soap.</p>
<p>Prithee, tell me thou art not a Sodomite.</p>
<p>Nope. Not even a Gomorrahian.</p>
<p>Oh, Temperance, I've got an overpowering urge to see you...</p>
<p>With your hat off!</p>
<p>Hmm. I can't. I must remember my wedding vows.</p>
<p>Did you promise to be miserable?</p>
<p>To be taken for granted by a drunken lout?</p>
<p>Pretty much. We wrote our own vows.</p>
<p>Enough talk!</p>
<p>I need to see how you look up there!</p>
<p>(GASPING)</p>
<p>I think my mother had one of those.</p>
<p>Ahh!</p>
<p>I'm finished! And it's so suggestive.</p>
<p>But like they say, &quot;Snuggling sells!&quot;</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING)</p>
<p>Now, do I dare push &quot;print&quot;?</p>
<p>(MOANING)</p>
<p>(BREATHING HEAVILY)</p>

<p>Well, what do you think?</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>I can't believe Mom wrote a book before we did!</p>
<p>And it's a little trashy.</p>
<p>Mom has expressed herself. We should nurture her.</p>
<p>Let's kiss boys! Binge and purge! Rock and roll!</p>
<p>You're not gettin' out till we're 16.</p>
<p>(GROWLING)</p>
<p>I'm proud of you, Mom.</p>
<p>But just one thing, isn't your book a little hard on Dad?</p>
<p>(NERVOUSLY) What do you mean? My book is set in whaling times.</p>
<p>&quot;Captain Mordecai stared at the shop &quot;window full of powdered blow holes.</p>
<p>&quot;Mmm! Blow holes, he drooled.&quot; Sounds like Dad to me.</p>
<p>Well, I guess that part is loosely based on your father.</p>
<p>Maybe you should let Dad read your book before you submit it to publishers.</p>
<p>I suppose I better. Your father's a very private person.</p>
<p>Marge, we're out of bath towels.</p>
<p>(BELL JINGLING) Ooh! Ice-cream truck!</p>
<p>(SINGING) Here in my car I am hosing off bl*od.</p>
<p>Some of it's mine but most of it's not.</p>
<p>Here's Marge.</p>
<p>Homie, I finished my novel.</p>
<p>Whoa! Typed.</p>
<p>It's really important that you read it and tell me what you think.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>Oh, 286 pages?</p>
<p>It's double-spaced.</p>
<p>Woo-hoo! I'm halfway through!</p>
<p>All right, &quot;Chapter I .&quot;</p>
<p>Hmm. That makes sense.</p>
<p>&quot;There once was a girl from Nantucket.&quot;</p>
<p>Good, good.</p>
<p>&quot;Her name was Temperance Barrows.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And her heart was heavy with feeling.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She...&quot;</p>
<p>(SNORING)</p>
<p>No! Gotta read Marge's book! Can't get distracted!</p>
<p>&quot;Distracted,&quot; that's a funny word.</p>
<p>Does anyone ever get &quot;tracted&quot;?</p>
<p>Let me call the su1c1de hotline and ask 'em.</p>
<p>Well? Well, what?</p>
<p>Did you read the book?</p>
<p>Oh. Yes.</p>
<p>Did you like it?</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Oh! That's wonderful. And the characters didn't bother you at all?</p>
<p>No. They were all, in their own way, totally awesome.</p>
<p>And you're fine with me trying to get it published?</p>
<p>As I've always said, &quot;Publish or perish.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, Homie!</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Now for that happy period between the lie and the time it's found out.</p>
<p>(HOMER CHUCKLING)</p>
<p>(PHONE RINGING)</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Marge. This is the best first novel my assistant has ever summarized for me.</p>
<p>Now all we need are some endorsements from famous writers.</p>
<p>Here's your quote.</p>
<p>&quot;Thomas Pynchon loved this book&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;almost as much as he loves cameras.&quot;</p>
<p>Hey, over here! Have your picture taken with a reclusive author.</p>
<p>Today only, we'll throw in a free autograph. But wait! There's more!</p>
<p>Hello, this is Tom Clancy.</p>
<p>Would I say, &quot;if you're hunting for a good read this October&quot;, &quot;Marge Simpson's book is a clear &quot;and present danger to your free time&quot;?</p>
<p>Hell, no, I wouldn't. What do you mean I just said it?</p>
<p>It doesn't count! Hello? Hello?</p>
<p>If Dad ever reads that book, he's gonna be so humiliated.</p>
<p>He'll never read it.</p>
<p>What if they make it into a movie?</p>
<p>He'll never see it.</p>
<p>What if they parody it on MADtv?</p>
<p>We're doomed!</p>
<p>(SIREN WAILING) So how much bleach did you drink?</p>
<p>Not a talker, eh?</p>
<p>I love this book, Marge. Very psychological.</p>
<p>Dr. Marvin Monroe? I haven't seen you in years!</p>
<p>Oh, I've been very sick.</p>
<p>If you ask me, this book sounds like Marge and Homer.</p>
<p>No one asked you.</p>
<p>Think about it. The boorish husband, the neglected wife, the sensitive hunk down the road.</p>
<p>(GIGGLING)</p>
<p>And on page 72, Temperance's name changes to Marge for three paragraphs.</p>
<p>Can you believe Marge...</p>
<p>Homer doesn't know.</p>
<p>Marge.</p>
<p>(ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY)</p>
<p>Can you believe that Homer and Marge's marriage is just a sham?</p>
<p>All right, I'll order. I'll have a medium pepperoni.</p>
<p>And could you space out the meat so that it spells, &quot;Happy birthday, Moe.&quot;</p>
<p>(SOBBING)</p>
<p>Oh, God! I'm alone!</p>
<p>(SIREN WAILING)</p>
<p>Apu, do you still have Krazy Straws?</p>
<p>I've got a guy with a broken back and I'm trying to cheer him up.</p>
<p>Oh, Mr. Homer, anything for a cuckolded boob.</p>
<p>I mean, a loyal customer.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Nothing, nothing.</p>
<p>It just seems your wife has an active imagination.</p>
<p>Why do you keep talking that way?</p>
<p>You'll see when you read your wife's book.</p>
<p>Well, then maybe I will!</p>
<p>If you do, you'll see she lusts for Flanders.</p>
<p>That one I got.</p>
<p>This is how you talk when you learn English from porno movies.</p>
<p>I'll have to read Marge's book.</p>
<p>And I swore never to read again after To k*ll a Mockingbird gave me no useful advice on k*ll mockingbirds!</p>
<p>It did teach me not to judge a man based on the color of his skin.</p>
<p>But what good does that do me?</p>
<p>(HOMER READING)</p>
<p>(Ashley) &quot;The Harpooned Heart by Marge Simpson.&quot;</p>
<p>Your turn, Mary-Kate.</p>
<p>MARY-KATE: &quot;There once was a girl from Nantucket.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Her name was Temperance Barrows.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And her heart was heavy with feeling.&quot;</p>
<p>Take it, Ashley.</p>
<p>(Ashley) &quot;Temperance was trapped in a loveless marriage.&quot;</p>
<p>Bummer. I didn't know people were sad in the past.</p>
<p>&quot;The Harpooned Heart Two. Thunder Down Under. Chapter 1.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Temperance Barrows stared at the shrimp on the barbie.&quot;</p>
<p>How can you write such horrible things about me?</p>
<p>You told me you liked it!</p>
<p>You didn't read it at all! You lied to me!</p>
<p>I didn't lie. I was writing fiction with my mouth.</p>
<p>Just tell me how much of this is true!</p>
<p>Well, there is a place called Nantucket.</p>
<p>I knew it! (SOBBING)</p>
<p>And what about the romance between you and Cyrus?</p>
<p>It was only my imagination.</p>
<p>Well, I'll make sure you never imagine anything again!</p>
<p>(DOOR SLAMMING)</p>
<p>(BANGING ON DOOR)</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Flanders!</p>
<p>Open this door, right now!</p>
<p>Well, I guess it wouldn't k*ll me to let you in.</p>
<p>(HOMER MUTTERING ANGRILY)</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>Stealing doormats.</p>
<p>Dad's gonna catch Flanders, just like the end of Mom's book!</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. How does that go again?</p>
<p>Ugh! Didn't you read Mom's book?</p>
<p>Fine! I'll tell you how it ends.</p>
<p>&quot;The brutish Captain Mordecai has cornered his rival, Cyrus...&quot;</p>
<p>Put that harpoon down, Captain.</p>
<p>You wouldn't k*ll the father of your next child, would you?</p>
<p>Oops! (GROWLING)</p>
<p>Temperance, I'll treasure your memory as long as I...</p>
<p>No, no! Not the new guy!</p>
<p>(LAUGHING EVILLY)</p>
<p>Now that your boyfriend's dead, I'm free to be selfish, drunk, emotionally distant, sexually ungenerous, pissy, and...</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: &quot;As Temperance watched the two men she had loved&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;and the one whale she admired disappear into the ocean,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;she realized it was the end.&quot;</p>
<p>(SIREN WAILING)</p>
<p>Flanders, pull over! I'm an ambulance!</p>
<p>Well, he's got me there.</p>
<p>(PANTING)</p>
<p>Dear Lord, please make Homer's blows precise and deadly with a minimum of pain.</p>
<p>Oh! And forgive me for those impure thoughts.</p>
<p>I had about the girl on the raisin box.</p>
<p>Flanders, I'm gonna do something.</p>
<p>I should've done a long time ago!</p>
<p>Would you help me be a better husband?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>In Marge's book, I was so mean and you were so nice.</p>
<p>How can I be more like you? Just give me some advice.</p>
<p>Advice?</p>
<p>Just call me Ann Flanders. Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Oh, and another thing...</p>
<p>Please! Homie, don't hurt him!</p>
<p>And a backrub can just be a backrub.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to lead to adult situations.</p>
<p>Why would I rub her back unless I wanted to get some...</p>
<p>Oh, to make her feel good.</p>
<p>Oh, Homie.</p>
<p>You're trying to improve yourself and it's because of my book.</p>
<p>That's right. I love you, Marge.</p>
<p>And I realize now I should show you more often.</p>
<p>The end of your book was the wakeup call I needed after falling asleep at the beginning of your book.</p>
<p>That's the best review I've gotten.</p>
<p>Seriously, these reviews are terrible.</p>
<p>Don't worry about those losers, Marge.</p>
<p>I think it's time we went home and collaborated on a little project of our own.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING SUGGESTIVELY)</p>
<p>Marge, I got it all figured out.</p>
<p>Lee Harvey Oswald wanted to steal the Jack Ruby!</p>
<p>Jack Ruby was a man, not a jewel.</p>
<p>(GROANING)</p>
<p>All right. We're back to square one. Put on some coffee.</p>
<p>(MARGE GROANING)</p>
<p>I was so close.</p>
