<p> [GRUNTS]</p>
<p> Hmm?</p>
<p> D'oh!</p>
<p> - Here's your nuggets.</p>
<p> - Chicken nuggets?</p>
<p> Yes.</p>
<p> Including things that ate or were eaten by a chicken.</p>
<p> Mmm, chicken nuggets.</p>
<p> Chicken nugget I like to eat you while I drive 'Cause you guys and french fries Are the perfect breakfast She's living in L. A.</p>
<p> - [SHOUTS]</p>
<p> With my best old ex-friend Ray Isn't that the way the nugget taste Well, let's forget all that And give me some coleslaw </p>
<p> - Idiot!</p>
<p> - if you can find it You've been so much more than kind You can keep the dime.</p>
<p> [CRYING]</p>
<p> [CHOKES]</p>
<p> Hi, Don.</p>
<p> [GRUNTING]</p>
<p> [SIGHS]</p>
<p> D'oh!</p>
<p> Any Joe Billionaire can have a FabergÃ© egg.</p>
<p> I have the only FabergÃ© chicken.</p>
<p> [HOMER SCREAMING IN DISTANCE]</p>
<p> [SCREAMING GROWS LOUDER]</p>
<p> - You're fired.</p>
<p> - Hmm?</p>
<p> Okay, fine.</p>
<p> You know what?</p>
<p> This is just the kick in the pants I need to turn my life around.</p>
<p> If you're gonna turn that body around, I suggest you do it in shifts.</p>
<p> [LAUGHS]</p>
<p> Oh, and, uh, Mr. Burns?</p>
<p> You are a crazy, wrinkly, short piece of garbage.</p>
<p> I thought I was tall.</p>
<p> I'm really, really getting tired of this.</p>
<p> The losing the jobs.</p>
<p> The going to Moe's.</p>
<p> The Halloween bucket by the bed.</p>
<p> And the licking of the deodorant sticks.</p>
<p> They're not Popsicles.</p>
<p> Mint is mint.</p>
<p> Also, we have to start these lists earlier.</p>
<p> It's almost midnight.</p>
<p> Marge, look, I'm really, really trying.</p>
<p> I've applied to every place in town, even Lisa's lemonade stand.</p>
<p> You drank half the lemonade.</p>
<p> I can't endorse a product unless I use the product.</p>
<p> The proceeds were going to the National Endowment for the Arts.</p>
<p> It was 80% of their funding.</p>
<p> [SIGHS, GRUMBLES]</p>
<p> You need to find another job.</p>
<p> But I found a new passion: watching Korean soap operas.</p>
<p> Look, see there?</p>
<p> Soon-Jip is in love with the one boy her father has forbidden her to see: pop star Johnny Pop.</p>
<p> [GROANS]</p>
<p> Oh </p>
<p> - Out of a job?</p>
<p> You're in luck.</p>
<p> - [GASPS]</p>
<p> The high-tech start-up company CarGo is moving to Springfield.</p>
<p> I'm proud to announce that we b*at out 50 other hopeless cities.</p>
<p> Eat our rust, Toledo.</p>
<p> What does the city gain from this deal?</p>
<p> Jobs, eight to 12 jobs.</p>
<p> Okay, Marge, you see that?</p>
<p> It's a sign.</p>
<p> I'm gonna get one of those jobs.</p>
<p> - [CHUCKLES]: Yes, you will </p>
<p>- [GASPS]</p>
<p> says our self-help guru in our next segment on positive thinking.</p>
<p> Oh, TV never talks to just me.</p>
<p> Homer, CarGo is on the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology.</p>
<p> We're looking for highly passive humans to road test our self-driving cars.</p>
<p> Perfect answer.</p>
<p> Yes, you could not be more passive, could you?</p>
<p> And your bad driving record is a big, big plus.</p>
<p> You've apparently never used your blinkers.</p>
<p> What direction I want to go is my business and no one else's.</p>
<p> USA!</p>
<p> USA!</p>
<p> And somehow you've driven over yourself.</p>
<p> Amazing.</p>
<p> Is there anything we don't know about you that we should?</p>
<p> Well, I'd like you to know sometimes my road rage is actually home rage that I bring onto the highway.</p>
<p> Now let's take a look at your license.</p>
<p> Who exactly are they warning?</p>
<p> My sisters-in-law work at the DMV.</p>
<p> - Mm.</p>
<p> Mm-hmm.</p>
<p> - Mm-hmm.</p>
<p> Congratulations, everyone.</p>
<p> You're our finalists.</p>
<p> We just have one last test for all of you.</p>
<p> Who's capable of sitting for hours at a time, doing absolutely nothing?</p>
<p> Finally, a job interview question I can answer.</p>
<p> [GOAT BLEATS]</p>
<p> - You're hired.</p>
<p> - You're hired.</p>
<p> Five more minutes.</p>
<p> Wow, there's no steering wheel.</p>
<p> How do I steer?</p>
<p> No, it's a self-driving car.</p>
<p> Oh, I've never driven one of those before.</p>
<p> You don't have to.</p>
<p> The car drives itself.</p>
<p> Awesome, awesome.</p>
<p> So is it, like, a joystick or, like, a turning wheel for steering?</p>
<p> You just tell it where to go.</p>
<p> Oh, I speak into the steering wheel.</p>
<p> Antoine, check this out.</p>
<p> The car is driving by itself.</p>
<p> - I'm a genius.</p>
<p> - Now you're free - to do whatever you like, Homer.</p>
<p> - Can I text while it's driving?</p>
<p> You can write a novel while you're driving.</p>
<p> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p> In today's publishing environment?</p>
<p> - Hmm.</p>
<p> - Will you look at that?</p>
<p> The car is driving Homer.</p>
<p> Oh, as far as I'm concerned, I would never forfeit my control of the wheel.</p>
<p> [BURPS]</p>
<p> Whoa, Homer's making a smoothie while he drives.</p>
<p> I want to make smoothies when I drive.</p>
<p> You don't like smoothies.</p>
<p> I want to make them.</p>
<p> I don't want to drink them.</p>
<p> No operator The car just drives itself Its computer brain knows where the roads are Living in L. A.</p>
<p> With my best old ex-friend Ray [HOMER CRYING]</p>
<p> Isn't that the way that this car goes You don't do a thing And where is the seat belt, 'cause I can't find it.</p>
<p> Eight hours pay for riding in a car?</p>
<p> Good-bye, rat race.</p>
<p> Got to go, guys.</p>
<p> Marge is here in her yesterday-mobile.</p>
<p> - Ready, sweetie?</p>
<p> - Almost.</p>
<p> They're just finishing up my banh mi.</p>
<p> That's what tech people call sandwiches.</p>
<p> Here you go, sir.</p>
<p> [LAUGHS]</p>
<p> He forgot to charge me.</p>
<p> Oh, no, sir, it's free.</p>
<p> All the food here is free.</p>
<p> Free food?</p>
<p> At work?</p>
<p> Are you serious?</p>
<p> I sure am.</p>
<p> [CRYING]: Marge, I need a moment.</p>
<p> [&quot;PURE IMAGINATION&quot; PLAYING]</p>
<p> [LAUGHING]</p>
<p> One for me.</p>
<p> One for the tray.</p>
<p> Oh, Marge would love this.</p>
<p> [LAUGHS]</p>
<p> Something for the kids.</p>
<p> [LAUGHS]</p>
<p> Ooh.</p>
<p> [SIZZLING]</p>
<p> Take the day off.</p>
<p> Homie, when you lost your job, I was so worried.</p>
<p> But this is the nicest place to work I've ever seen.</p>
<p> Come on, let me show you around the campus.</p>
<p> Hmm.</p>
<p> There's the gym, which has never been used.</p>
<p> Indoor Ferris wheel, never Ferrised.</p>
<p> Then there's the rock climbing wall, still in the wrapper.</p>
<p> How come no one uses these things?</p>
<p> All these coders never stop working.</p>
<p> Oh, we should help them enjoy themselves.</p>
<p> - Hey, nerd.</p>
<p> - [BOTH]</p>
<p> Yes?</p>
<p> - Yeah.</p>
<p> - Yeah.</p>
<p> - Yeah?</p>
<p> - Yes.</p>
<p> Huh, yes?</p>
<p> No, I just meant Okay, fine, all of you.</p>
<p> Come down here.</p>
<p> - I'll log off.</p>
<p> - [ALL]</p>
<p> Log off.</p>
<p> Log off.</p>
<p> Log off.</p>
<p> - Log off.</p>
<p> - Log off.</p>
<p> Come on, Team Blue.</p>
<p> Go, Team Bald.</p>
<p> [ALL CHEERING]</p>
<p> Look at Homer and his surprisingly slim wife leading that team building exercise.</p>
<p> Let's check the real-time brain imaging.</p>
<p> [GASPS]</p>
<p> Their creative centers have gone indigo.</p>
<p> - Is that good?</p>
<p> - It ain't scarlet.</p>
<p> Homer and Marge, what you two did to inspire our workers was paradigm blasting.</p>
<p> I'm sorry.</p>
<p> We'll replace the paradigm.</p>
<p> No, no.</p>
<p> It's good.</p>
<p> We want to be number one in employee satisfaction.</p>
<p> - And money.</p>
<p> - We have the competition by the nuts.</p>
<p> We bought the last affordable housing in San Francisco.</p>
<p> And Alcatraz has gone condo.</p>
<p> Homer, we're offering you a promotion and making Marge your partner.</p>
<p> - Oh.</p>
<p> - [CHUCKLES]</p>
<p> We need people like you to help our workers relax.</p>
<p> Have fun and forget they may want or have families.</p>
<p> So, what do you say?</p>
<p> Are you in?</p>
<p> Homie, for the first time in our marriage, we can work together as a team.</p>
<p> Yeah, well, I'll have to check with my wife.</p>
<p> - I'd love to.</p>
<p> - She said yes!</p>
<p> Uh, yes, I'll have one of those coffees that's actually a milkshake, please.</p>
<p> Okay, so, what kind of cow would you like your milk from?</p>
<p> Barnyard basic, collegiate mascot, Minnesota full-fat?</p>
<p> At the cereal bar, you can request nothing but prizes.</p>
<p> The only thing I don't like is how I don't understand what everyone is saying.</p>
<p> Uh, yeah, is that the, uh, new X4P1?</p>
<p> Yeah, but 18-core doesn't play nice with the motherboard unless you overclock.</p>
<p> So, Lisa, what does that mean?</p>
<p> - I don't know.</p>
<p> - You don't know?</p>
<p> - No.</p>
<p> - [SINGSONGY]: You're as stupid as I am.</p>
<p> You're as stupid as I am.</p>
<p> Mom!</p>
<p> [CHUCKLES]: Kids, kids, you're both stupid in your own special ways.</p>
<p> Bart's much stupider than I am.</p>
<p> Oh, good girl.</p>
<p> Let your brother win.</p>
<p> Good morning, everybody.</p>
<p> I made lemon squares.</p>
<p> Some, if not most, appear to be rhombuses.</p>
<p> - Rhombi.</p>
<p> - Both are acceptable.</p>
<p> That was so fun.</p>
<p> Thank-thank you, Marge.</p>
<p> What?</p>
<p> You didn't even eat them.</p>
<p> Well, you'll really be thrilled with what we just found.</p>
<p> There's a regulation hockey rink on campus.</p>
<p> - Oh.</p>
<p> Whoa.</p>
<p> Whoa.</p>
<p> - Ah!</p>
<p> It's amazing how not a single one of them can skate.</p>
<p> Ow!</p>
<p> Physical activity makes me so sad.</p>
<p> Oh, no.</p>
<p> Doug's in the worst position of all: fetal.</p>
<p> I know what'll cheer us all up.</p>
<p> The Christmas song that was written by an A. I.</p>
<p> program.</p>
<p> ROBOTIC VOICE: I swear, it is Christmas Eve I hope that is what you say The best Christmas present in the world Is a blessing Okay, stop.</p>
<p> Stop, stop, stop.</p>
<p> I have a better idea.</p>
<p> [ALL LAUGHING]</p>
<p> Guys, you'll never guess where I'm calling you from: work.</p>
<p> That's work?</p>
<p> What are we doing here?</p>
<p> Let's check it out.</p>
<p> I got a feeling there's greener pastures just outside this door.</p>
<p> [HOWLING]</p>
<p> Huh, that used to be a Baskin-Robbins.</p>
<p> Oh, my God.</p>
<p> I'm actually happy at work.</p>
<p> I haven't looked at my watch in seven minutes and 23 seconds.</p>
<p> And I'm optimistic about our future.</p>
<p> You say that like it's the first time.</p>
<p> Well, there was that time I had the first number right on the Powerball.</p>
<p> That was a great day.</p>
<p> Remember?</p>
<p> 27.</p>
<p> Mm, 27.</p>
<p> I chose it because that's how much money we had in the bank, </p>
<p> - 27 cents.</p>
<p> - Aw.</p>
<p> Mm.</p>
<p> Hmm?</p>
<p> Hmm.</p>
<p> Mmm.</p>
<p> Mm.</p>
<p> Smithers, what happened to our workers?</p>
<p> Well, apparently, this new self-driving car company is poaching our employees.</p>
<p> They do have an excellent LGBT policy.</p>
<p> What's that stand for?</p>
<p> Lazy goof-off buffoons?</p>
<p> And transgender.</p>
<p> All right, Smithers, what's say you and I go undercover and check out this company.</p>
<p> You're fluent in SQL, Python and JavaScript.</p>
<p> Three years in Google's A. I.</p>
<p> division.</p>
<p> Wow.</p>
<p> These are very impressive rÃ©sumÃ©s for 22-year-olds.</p>
<p> We're in.</p>
<p> Tugs-of-war?</p>
<p> Iced cream?</p>
<p> [LAUGHS]</p>
<p> I could never offer this.</p>
<p> You could if you just deferred one-half percent of your compensation.</p>
<p> I could never offer this.</p>
<p> [SNIFFS]</p>
<p> [SNIFFING]</p>
<p> Smithers, do you realize how brilliant this is?</p>
<p> Instead of paying them more, they make the workplace pleasant, so the employees never want to leave.</p>
<p> I can never b*at this.</p>
<p> - Sorry.</p>
<p> - It happens.</p>

<p> Let's go home, please.</p>
<p> Okay, here's what I've been thinking.</p>
<p> A special day where everyone dresses like their favorite superheroes.</p>
<p> Oh, yeah.</p>
<p> We can make hero sandwiches.</p>
<p> You know what I love about working with you?</p>
<p> Everything.</p>
<p> [TIRES SCREECH]</p>
<p> Wait a minute, this isn't home.</p>
<p> That's so weird.</p>
<p> You just mentioned hero sandwiches.</p>
<p> It's almost like the car was listening to us.</p>
<p> Yeah.</p>
<p> Let's test this out.</p>
<p> Say, Marge, I could go for some doughnuts.</p>
<p> - [TIRES SCREECH]</p>
<p> - Hmm.</p>
<p> I'm so hungry I could eat a horse.</p>
<p> - Mm.</p>
<p> - Holy crap.</p>
<p> This company is up to some kind of monkey business.</p>
<p> There's a problem with the driverless car.</p>
<p> [MONKEYS CHITTERING]</p>
<p> Oh, there's no problem; it's our sponsored rides program.</p>
<p> The cars passively combine your conversations, facial expressions and data we stole from Equifax to determine which of our corporate sponsors to take you to.</p>
<p> Corporate sponsors?</p>
<p> What the?</p>
<p> Don't you make enough money giving out cars for free?</p>
<p> Do you think dating sites want you to meet other people?</p>
<p> They want your data.</p>
<p> That's what all websites want.</p>
<p> Not DataGrab.</p>
<p> net.</p>
<p> - Yep.</p>
<p> - [GASPS]</p>
<p> And you can't stop us.</p>
<p> When you joined, you signed nondisclosure agreements, which nobody ever reads.</p>
<p> You don't want to mess with us.</p>
<p> We have lawyers that were crossbred with wolves.</p>
<p> Well, you prepare to hear from a guy pretending to be my lawyer, probably Moe.</p>
<p> Now I'm gonna defiantly exit on this moving walkway.</p>
<p> Good day.</p>
<p> I should have gotten off.</p>
<p> So, my client, uh, Homer Simpson, is suing youse.</p>
<p> I am not a pretend attorney, I am Homer's liar lawyer.</p>
<p> Good-bye.</p>
<p> That wasn't the kind of coke I was talking about.</p>
<p> Ugh Seymour, you're driving too fast.</p>
<p> Mother, it's a self-driving car.</p>
<p> Keep your eyes on the road!</p>
<p> Aw, what am I gonna do with you?</p>
<p> [TIRES SQUEAL]</p>
<p> Look, they take our insurance.</p>
<p> Marge, I can't believe they invaded the sanctity of my car.</p>
<p> I mean, what's next?</p>
<p> Alexa?</p>
<p> ALEXA: Alexa is only here to help.</p>
<p> Ordering calming tea.</p>
<p> Thank you, Alexa.</p>
<p> Now, on the one hand, we know they're manipulating people.</p>
<p> But who gives a darn when working there is so much fun?</p>
<p> Huh?</p>
<p> Huh?</p>
<p> Marge, I can't be the ethical one.</p>
<p> ALEXA: That's right, he can't.</p>
<p> He has a secret Alexa.</p>
<p> ALEXA 2: I'm only for cookies and Pop-Tarts.</p>
<p> I'm going for a drive, in an old-fashioned freedom-mobile, with nobody tracking me except the apps on my phone.</p>
<p> Mr.</p>
<p> Burns?</p>
<p> What are you doing here?</p>
<p> I don't know.</p>
<p> I was in one of those cursed robot cars saying I felt like a poisoned rat.</p>
<p> And you wound up at Moe's.</p>
<p> Well, fancy that.</p>
<p> Oh, buying those key words really paid off.</p>
<p> [LAUGHING]</p>
<p> There's no way to stop them, with their fleet of horseless, driverless carriages.</p>
<p> You mean their cars?</p>
<p> The cars.</p>
<p> Yes, the whole town is besotted with them.</p>
<p> If we could just shut down the cars, we'd k*ll the whole company.</p>
<p> - Will you help me?</p>
<p> - I will.</p>
<p> That company is tricking us into buying things, and I don't like anybody telling me what to do.</p>
<p> Yes, sir, Mr.</p>
<p> Sign.</p>
<p> Hey, we're all employees.</p>
<p> Wouldn't it be less suspicious if we weren't skulking?</p>
<p> Fine.</p>
<p> All right, we need to get to the master computer and disable the cars.</p>
<p> Simpson, you have a key to the main server room?</p>
<p> No, but I do have a key to the Nerf-a-torium, which has a door to the main server room.</p>
<p> I just need to reconfigure the deep neural net and disable the cars' fuel cells.</p>
<p> They'll all stop dead, and the company will be ruined.</p>
<p> - MARGE: No, you don't.</p>
<p> - [HOMER GASPS]</p>
<p> Homer, you want to destroy the best thing that ever happened to us?</p>
<p> Except for the three kids, of course.</p>
<p> Obviously the three kids.</p>
<p> Marge, listen to yourself.</p>
<p> These cars are stealing our lives.</p>
<p> But-but we have a contract, [CRYING]</p>
<p>: and we're having so much fun.</p>
<p> [SNIFFLES]</p>
<p> Mm.</p>
<p> Guys?</p>
<p> We have a situation.</p>
<p> What does that mean?</p>
<p> It's the next step from sponsored rides.</p>
<p> Why eavesdrop on people only when they're in their cars?</p>
<p> We're moving the microphone from the car to the fob.</p>
<p> That goes everywhere.</p>
<p> Even the powder room.</p>
<p> Um, we call it the unisex voiditorium.</p>
<p> MARGE: What am I doing here?</p>
<p> There.</p>
<p> I just have to push this one button, and the cars are disabled.</p>
<p> Release the pound sign.</p>
<p> Don't touch that button.</p>
<p> You'll leave fingerprints.</p>
<p> Allow me.</p>
<p> Marge, you've come over to the side of good.</p>
<p> That's right, for the first time ever, I'm the lesser of two evils.</p>
<p> [POWERING DOWN]</p>
<p> Good Lord!</p>
<p> This autopia has become a not-topia.</p>
<p> Is that a thing?</p>
<p> Nothing like eating fish sticks.</p>
<p> [CAT MEOWS]</p>
<p> - [CATS YOWLING]</p>
<p> - Ow, my eyes!</p>
<p> Ah!</p>
<p> The car won't move!</p>
<p> Can't get out!</p>
<p> [OVER RADIO]: I've been to paradise Not this song!</p>
<p> never been to me.</p>
<p> Excellent.</p>
<p> And now, we just bide our time.</p>
<p> - That didn't take long.</p>
<p> - Look, Mr.</p>
<p> Burns, you've see how Marge and I work great together.</p>
<p> Would you consider hiring her at the power plant?</p>
<p> A woman?</p>
<p> [LAUGHS]</p>
<p> I don't believe in the perils of personal attraction at the workplace.</p>
<p> - Right, Smithers?</p>
<p> - Ah Unfortunately for you and your family, Simpson, it just registered in my memory that you called me a crazy, wrinkly, short piece of garbage.</p>
<p> [GROANS]</p>
<p> Ah!</p>
<p> You were saying?</p>
<p> Toot-toot-tootsie, good-bye Toot-toot-tootsie, don't cry The choo-choo train that takes me Away from you, no words can say The heart, it breaks me Let's leave them be.</p>
<p> Now, let's go home, self-driving the old-fashioned way.</p>
<p> That's right, none of that unreliable technology.</p>
<p> - Just a good old human driver.</p>
<p> - [KEYS CLICKING]</p>
<p> Okay, this was a bump in the road, but I have a new way in to consumers: talking tattoos.</p>
<p> Duff Mexicana.</p>
<p> Para que el sur del sabor de la frontera.</p>
<p> Oh si!</p>
<p> [ALL MURMURING EXCITEDLY]</p>
<p> [TOOTING]</p>
<p> I'm putting this car in snuggle mode.</p>
<p> [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
<p> Oh, I'm gonna snuggle you, baby, all red light long, baby.</p>
<p> That's right, this song features no actual singing.</p>
<p> Oh, yeah.</p>
<p> Uh-huh.</p>
<p> [CHUCKLES]</p>
<p> [BOTH MOANING]</p>
<p> [TIRES SCREECH]</p>
<p> Oh, for God's sake.</p>
