<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Grampa! I don't mind when you spit at home.</p>
<p>But I have to work with these people.</p>
<p>Oh, jabber jacks! Schoolhouse don't put out spittoons, I ain't responsible.</p>
<p><em>All right, seniors...</em> we'd all love to share in your wisdom, experience, yadda, yadda, yadda.</p>
<p>Let's start with Milhouse's grandfather.</p>
<p>Uh, how many of you have a house?</p>
<p>All right. Now how many of you drove your house to school today?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Well, I did.</p>
<p>No, I'm not Superman. I just own an R.V.</p>
<p><em>Me and the new wife travel the country searching for adventure.</em></p>
<p>Last fall, we won a chili cook-off in Beaumont, Texas.</p>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p><em>You're livin'in a fool's paradise, Van Houten.</em></p>
<p>If you fell down in the shower, that thing'd be your tomb.</p>
<p>Grampa, hush! Here. Why don't you spit some more?</p>
<p>No, I'm not Superman. I'm a judge.</p>
<p>Why, just this morning I sentenced my 46th man to death.</p>
<p>No, 47 th.</p>
<p>Wow, 47! I love you, Grandpa.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, well, I may not have a fancy black bathrobe...</em> and a hammer like Snooty... but I do have slippers and an oatmeal spoon.</p>
<p>Look!</p>
<p>Bart, perhaps your grandfather... would like to come up front now and give someone else a chance to interrupt.</p>
<p>Oh, please, no.</p>
<p>About time, knothead.</p>
<p><em>Now- Hey, listen!</p>
<p>Now, my story begins in nineteen dickety-two.</em></p>
<p>We had to say &quot;dickety,&quot; 'cause the kaiser had stolen our word &quot;twenty.&quot;</p>
<p>I chased that rascal to get it back...</p>
<p><em>but gave up after dickety-six miles.</em></p>
<p>Dickety? Highly dubious.</p>
<p>What are you cackling at, fatty? Too much pie.</p>
<p>That's your problem.</p>
<p>Now, I'd like to digress from my prepared remarks... to discuss how I invented the &quot;terlet.&quot;</p>
<p>Terlet. Ha!</p>
<p>Stop your snickering! I spent three years on that terlet!</p>
<p>And then he claimed he was the one who turned cats and dogs against each other.</p>
<p>Why is he always making up those crazy stories?</p>
<p>Maybe it's time we put Grampa in a home.</p>
<p>You already put him in a home.</p>
<p>Maybe it's time we put him in one where he can't get out.</p>
<p>No! Old people deserve our respect.</p>
<p>Look at Jacques Cousteau and Goldie Hawn.</p>
<p>You wouldn't shut them away like second-class citizens.</p>
<p>Second-class!</p>
<p>What about Social Security, bus discounts... medic alert jewelry, Gold Bond powder... pants all the way up to your armpits... and all those other senior perks.</p>
<p>Oh, if you ask me, old folks have it pretty sweet.</p>
<p>Mm, let's see.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Eh, this junk was hardly worth gettin' up for.</p>
<p>Maybe if I go back to sleep for a few days, some good mail will build up.</p>
<p>Hey, what's this? &quot;Asa Phelps has&quot;-</p>
<p>The seventh Hellfish is dead!</p>
<p>That means the fortune's almost mine.</p>
<p>Asa Phelps spent his entire life in Springfield...</p>
<p><em>except for a four-year service in World w*r II and one high school day trip.</p>
<p>He worked at the United Strut and Bracing Works as a molders boy... until he was replaced by a Moldermatic and died.</em></p>
<p>Would you do the honors?</p>
<p>Well, Simpson, seven gone.</p>
<p>As soon as you're in your pressboard coffin...</p>
<p>I'll be the sole survivor, and the treasure will be mine.</p>
<p>Over my dead body it will!</p>
<p>That's exactly the point!</p>
<p>Oh, Simpson, can't you go five seconds without humiliating yourself?</p>
<p>How long was that?</p>
<p>Your clownish behavior notwithstanding... we have made a gentleman's agreement... and sworn on our lives to honor it.</p>
<p>Smithers, I want that man k*ll.</p>
<p>Well, let's see. Mesmerists, dowsers, Luddites, alienists...</p>
<p>Zoroastrians, alphabetizers-</p>
<p>Aha! Assassins!</p>
<p>I was wondering, sir. Do we really need to, uh... settle Abe Simpson?</p>
<p>I mean, I'm familiar with his physical state... and perhaps if we wait, nature will assassinate him for us.</p>
<p>Well, I can't risk it. I won't allow that Simpson boy to take the Hellfish bonanza.</p>
<p>And I can't get it without his key.</p>
<p>Ah, just the man I need.</p>
<p>Fernando Vidal, the world's most devious assassin.</p>
<p><em>Hola.</p>
<p>Fernando, it's M.B.</em></p>
<p>Ah, Marion Barry. Is it time for another shipment already?</p>
<p><em>Oi! This is Montgomery Burns!</p>
<p>Oh, caramba.</em></p>
<p>I'm sending you a photo over the Faxtrola.</p>
<p>I need you to fly to Springfield and assassinate this man posthaste.</p>
<p>Ah, Del Monte.</p>
<p>Enjoy them, old man. They will be your last.</p>
<p>Hey, what the- I'm up! I'm up!</p>
<p>Ah, he's more clever than he looks.</p>
<p>Abraham Simpson, your family is here to visit you.</p>
<p>Hot diggety! My family's come to visit me!</p>
<p>It-Wait a minute!</p>
<p>My family never comes to vi-</p>
<p>D'oh! Not again!</p>
<p>I can't take much more of your blundering numskullery.</p>
<p>I'll be in the car, dudes.</p>
<p>There is one more way to k*ll a man... but it is as intricate and precise... as a well-played game of chess.</p>
<p>Was that me, or was that you?</p>
<p>Help! Nurse! Someone's trying to k*ll me!</p>
<p>Okay, we'll do something about that right away.</p>
<p>Let's start by doubling your medication.</p>
<p>Our residents... are trying... to nap!</p>
<p><em>Ah.! Let me in.!</p>
<p>Someone's trying to k*ll me.! Sweet merciful McGillicutty.!</p>
<p>You gotta open the door.!</em></p>
<p>Who is it?</p>
<p>It's Grampa.</p>
<p>And it sounds like he's gotten into the horseradish again.</p>
<p>And then a kn*fe flew at my head!</p>
<p>And you were there... and you were there.</p>
<p>Uh, Grampa, maybe I should moisten your washcloth.</p>
<p>It's plenty moist! Listen!</p>
<p>Monty Burns is trying to k*ll me, and it's all because-</p>
<p>Uh, um, I can't tell you why.</p>
<p>Well, I'm sure you'll make up something.</p>
<p>Maybe you just need more of my classmates around.</p>
<p>I gotta hole up here for a while. They might still be after me!</p>
<p>Wow! He's even more agitated than usual.</p>
<p>Maybe we should let him stay.</p>
<p>Where are we going to put him?</p>
<p>Bart's room.</p>
<p>Bart's room.</p>
<p>Bart's room.</p>
<p>Dumpster.</p>
<p>Sorry to crowd you, boy, but I'll let you in on a secret.</p>
<p>Burns is after me 'cause he wants the Hellfish bonanza.</p>
<p>Look, if you're gonna stay in my room... could you at least stop making up gibberish?</p>
<p>Gibberish, eh? Then what's this?</p>
<p><em>Wrinkly gibberish?</em></p>
<p>I got this in the Second World w*r II.</p>
<p>Back then I was known as Sergeant Simpson...</p>
<p><em>and I commanded the Flying Hellfish... the fightingest squad in the fightingest company... in the third-fightingest battalion in the army.</p>
<p>We were all from Springfield.</p>
<p>There was Police Chief Wiggum's father, Iggy Wiggum.</em></p>
<p>Um, if anybody finds a grenade without a pin, that's mine.</p>
<p><em>Our radioman, Sheldon Skinner.</em></p>
<p>All right, very funny.</p>
<p>Well, I didn't join the service to make friends.</p>
<p><em>And watching our backs was Private Fifth Class Arnie Gumble.</p>
<p>Then there was also Griff, Asa, Ox and Etch.</p>
<p>But every unit has a troublemaker.</p>
<p>Ours was a cocky little private named Montgomery Burns.</em></p>
<p>Haven't you won the w*r yet?</p>
<p>Duh, hey! You said you was dead.</p>
<p>Yes. Dead tired. But I'm quite refreshed now. Thank you.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. You bossed around the richest, most powerful guy in town?</p>
<p>How come you were a sergeant and he was only a private?</p>
<p>Well, he got busted down for obstructing a probe from J. Edgar Hoover.</p>
<p>We got stuck with him.</p>
<p><em>Now they'll never save your brain, h*tler.</p>
<p>Little help?</em></p>

<p>Boom! Boom it went! Boom! Just like that!</p>
<p><em>They took a photo of my keister for Stars and Stripes.!</p>
<p>At least they told me it was for Stars and Stripes.</em></p>
<p>Well, if you saved Burns's life, why does he want to k*ll you?</p>
<p>It was the closing days of the w*r.</p>
<p>We had just flushed some Germans out of an abandoned castle.</p>
<p>Hey! Burnsie found some pictures.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. We ain't-a supposed to steal from civilians.</p>
<p>You want me to report you to Commander Flanders? Just leave them, Burnsie.</p>
<p>Leave them for whom? The Germans?</p>
<p>The folks who sh**t at us all day? Let's just take them.</p>
<p>We'll all be rich- rich as n*zi.</p>
<p>Wow! I'd like to be as rich as the n*zi!</p>
<p>Think of what a guy could get himself with that kind of scratch.</p>
<p>Yeah. I could buy chicken dinners three times a day.</p>
<p>I could buy a brand-new Studebaker with a fan on the dashboard.</p>
<p>I could buy my way into high- society.</p>
<p>Well, I don't feel right about it... but I could use a nest egg for retirement.</p>
<p>I'd hate to wind up in one of them old folks' homes.</p>
<p><em>Then it's agreed.</em></p>
<p>Of course, we can't sell the paintings now. We'd be caught.</p>
<p>How many of you are familiar with the concept of a tontine?</p>
<p>All right, Ox. Why don't you take us through it.</p>
<p>Uhh, essentially, we all enter into a contract... whereby the last surviving participant... becomes the sole possessor of all them &quot;perty&quot; pictures.</p>
<p>Well put, Oxford. Now remember, you can't all sign with an &quot;X.&quot;</p>
<p><em>So we sealed up the paintings... knowing only one of us would ever look upon them again.</em></p>
<p>Ox was the first to go.</p>
<p>He got a hernia carrying the crate out of the castle.</p>
<p>Five more men died in the Veterans Day float disaster of'79.</p>
<p>Now, with Asa gone, it's down to me and Burns.</p>
<p>Great story, Grampa. Could've used a vampire though. Night.</p>
<p>My own grandson thinks I'm a liar.</p>
<p>Don't k*ll me!</p>
<p>I've tried to meet you halfway on this, Simpson... but you had to be little Johnny Live-A-Lot.</p>
<p>Now give me your key to the Hellfish bonanza.</p>
<p>Oh, wow! There really is a treasure!</p>
<p>Whatever you do, don't give him the key, Grampa.</p>
<p>Here's the key.</p>
<p>Aw, figures. Hey, Mr. Burns!</p>
<p>Can I go with you to get the treasure?</p>
<p>I won't eat much, and I don't know the difference between right and wrong.</p>
<p>Oh, you're a good boy... but the child labor people have been watching me like a hawk.</p>
<p>Well, I'm off to get the paintings. As they say, &quot;time is Monets.&quot;</p>
<p>As you were, Sergeant.</p>
<p><em>Oh, terribly sorry. Back to sleep, little girl.</p>
<p>Santa?</em></p>
<p>I guess Burns is finally gonna be rich.</p>
<p>Not without the keys he isn't.</p>
<p>Hey, you got the keys!</p>
<p>Now we can get the treasure!</p>
<p>Oh, what's the use?</p>
<p>Burns would still find some way to take it from me.</p>
<p>I can't believe you, Grampa.</p>
<p>The sergeant in that story you told would never be scared of a dork like Burns.</p>
<p>You gotta get that treasure. You gotta do it for Ox and Asa and Griff and Burnsie!</p>
<p>Well, not so much Burnsie.</p>
<p>You really think I can do it?</p>
<p>Uh, yes. But we gotta act fast.</p>
<p>Where are you two going at this hour?</p>
<p>On a treasure hunt.</p>
<p>Oh, can I come?</p>
<p>Only if you're ready to stare danger in the face... put your manhood to the ultimate test and take-</p>
<p>Pass.</p>
<p>Hey, Grampa, do you think your dead buddies get up and walk around at night?</p>
<p>If they're anything like me, they have to get up twice.</p>
<p>Okay, hold up here. Fellas, it's me, Sarge.</p>
<p>At ease. I know I'm bending the rules tonight... but I also know none of you wants that skunk Burns to take our treasure.</p>
<p>And I want you to know that when I die... you're all welcome to visit me in Rich Man's Heaven.</p>
<p>Now it's gonna show us exactly where to dig.</p>
<p><em>D'oh.!</em></p>
<p>Boy, you borrow us some diving equipment while I borrow this boat.</p>
<p>Well, howdy-doodilly, stranger. Couldn't help but notice you stealing my boat.</p>
<p>I'll bring it back.</p>
<p>You ever operated a power boat?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Know anything about water safety?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What do you need it for?</p>
<p><em>It's a secret.</p>
<p>Ooh, sounds spine-tingly-dingling.</em></p>
<p>Just promise you'll have a good time.</p>
<p>Maude! Boys! Come on up! We're gonna have a little campout in the dinghy.</p>
<p><em>Yea.!</em></p>
<p>Now remember the plan, boy.</p>
<p>If you run out of air, tug on the rope-</p>
<p><em>Sixty-four times. No more, no less. Got it.</em></p>
<p>No, no! Sixty-three times if you're out of air!</p>
<p>Sixty-four is if you've found the treasure.</p>
<p>Gotcha. Hey, Grampa, do you think I could've been a Flying Hellfish?</p>
<p>You're a gutsy daredevil with a give-'em-hell attitude and a fourth-grade education.</p>
<p>You could've made sergeant.</p>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p>Sixty-one, 62, 63-</p>
<p>Oh, no! Sixty-three! He's out of air!</p>
<p>I've sent my only grandson to a watery grave!</p>
<p>Sixty-four! He found the treasure! I'm rich!</p>
<p>You're one heck of a grandson, boy.</p>
<p>Now let's break her open and have a look-see.</p>
<p>Oh! Hey- Huh?</p>
<p>Huh. The light must've b*rned out.</p>
<p>I'll thank you to stop pinching my Botticelli.</p>
<p>Looks like I didn't need the keys after all.</p>
<p>I'll take the masterpieces. Thank you.</p>
<p>Consarn it!</p>
<p>You coward! You're an embarrassment to the name Hellfish!</p>
<p>Oh, am I?</p>
<p>No! Look! Take the art if you want. Just don't hurt the boy.</p>
<p>Hmm. I'd rather do both.</p>
<p><em>So long, Sarge. See you at the reunion in November.</em></p>
<p>Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I cost you your fortune, Grampa.</p>
<p>Ah, the fortune doesn't matter, boy.</p>
<p>The important thing is you're safe.</p>
<p>Now let's get that fortune!</p>
<p>They're gaining on us, sir. We'll have to jettison something.</p>
<p>It's been an honor to serve you, sir.</p>
<p>Consarn it! He's getting away!</p>
<p>In a pig's eye he is!</p>
<p>Act your age, Simpson! You look foolish!</p>
<p>Don't k*ll me.</p>
<p>I ain't gonna k*ll ya.</p>
<p>That'd be cowardly. Monty Burns cowardly.</p>
<p>I just wanna watch you squirm.</p>
<p>Yes, sir. Is this to your liking?</p>
<p>Now, Burnsie, there's one thing we don't stand for in the Hellfish... and that's trying to k*ll your commanding officer.</p>
<p>So consider this your dishonorable discharge.</p>
<p><em>You're out of my unit. You're out of the tontine.</em></p>
<p>And that means the paintings are mine!</p>
<p>Private, you are dismissed!</p>
<p>You're rich, Grampa! You did it!</p>
<p>And Burns can never take that away from you.</p>
<p>Freeze! U.S. State Department. We'll take those.</p>
<p>We've been helping the German government search for this stolen art for 50 years.</p>
<p>To avoid an international incident, we'll be returning it... to the descendant of its rightful owner.</p>
<p>Baron Von Bertzenberger, on behalf of the American people, I apologize for-</p>
<p><em>Ja, ja, ja. Mach schnell mit the art things, huh?</em></p>
<p>I must get back to Dance Central in Stuttgart in time to see Kraftwerk.</p>
<p><em>Hey, und, dummkopf! Watch out for the CD changer in my trunk, huh?</em></p>
<p>Idiot.</p>
<p>I guess he deserves it more than I do.</p>
<p>Well, at least I got to show you I wasn't always a pathetic old kook.</p>
<p>You never were, Grampa.</p>
<p>Oh, I'd hug ya, but I know you'd just get embarrassed.</p>
<p>I won't get embarrassed. I don't care who knows I love my grampa.</p>
<p>Hey, fun boys! Get a room!</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
