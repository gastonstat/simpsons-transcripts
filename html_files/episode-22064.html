<p>Ha-ha!</p>
<p>Look, Dad! They've got every kind of paper.</p>
<p>Loose-leaf, graph, unlined- [ Gasps ]</p>
<p>College-ruled.</p>
<p>Can't you just write on your arm like I do?</p>
<p>♪ [ Humming ]</p>
<p>All you're getting is rubber bands and paper clips?</p>
<p>Don't you need a notebook or something?</p>
<p>Nah.</p>
<p>These days, everything's done on computers.</p>
<p>And staplers. Computers and staplers.</p>
<p>[ Groans ]</p>
<p>&quot;Krusty's Speak and Say&quot;?</p>
<p>&quot;S&quot; is for shiksa. S-H-I- Mmm-</p>
<p>I think there's a &quot;T&quot; in there somewhere. Ah, look it up.</p>
<p>Lisa! Stay cool, Milly.</p>
<p>[ Groans ]</p>
<p>Oh. Hi, Lisa. Did you have a nice summer?</p>
<p>Don't you hate that we have to go back to stupid school tomorrow?</p>
<p>I like school.</p>
<p>Me too!</p>
<p>We have so much in common.</p>
<p>You have a pen glued to your cowlick.</p>
<p>If you don't like it, it's gone!</p>
<p>[ Strains, Groans ]</p>
<p>Uh, you want this?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yo, Apu, give me the usual.</p>
<p>Yes, sir. One Kwik-E dog, one bubble gum cigar... and the latest issue of <em>Success</em> magazine.</p>
<p>Hey, this hot dog tastes different.</p>
<p>Yes. I just cleaned out the machine, sir.</p>
<p>So the snack you are enjoying has not been soaking in putrid grease.</p>
<p>Well, yeah. But without the grease... all you can taste is the hog anus.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry, but I sold it all to the rendering plant.</p>
<p>People buy grease?</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>They use it to make products such as soap, cosmetics, baby food.</p>
<p>Used grease is worth money? [ Gasps ]</p>
<p>Then my arteries are clogged with yellow gold!</p>
<p>I'm rich, Apu! Rich and- [ Groaning ]</p>
<p>[ Sighs ] Money in the bank.</p>
<p>Okay, this bacon's done.</p>
<p>And now for the profit-taking.</p>
<p>[ Chuckling ]</p>
<p>Uh, Dad, I don't think the dog can handle any more bacon.</p>
<p>[ Whimpering ]</p>
<p><em>[ Homer ] Looks like he's about ready for another squeezin;</em></p>
<p>Homer! That side of bacon was for my bridge game tonight.</p>
<p>Marge, if you don't mind, I'm a little busy right now... achieving financial independence.</p>
<p>With cans of grease?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Through savings and wise investments. Of course with grease!</p>
<p><em>[ Tires Screeching ]</em></p>
<p>Come on, Bart. The bus is here.</p>
<p>Where do you think you're going?</p>
<p>It's the first day of school.</p>
<p>Not for you it isn't. You're in the grease business now.</p>
<p><em>Then the doctor told me that both my eyes were lazy.</em></p>
<p>And that's why it was the best summer ever.</p>
<p>Thank you, Ralph. Now take your seat.</p>

<p>[ Skinner On P.A. ] Attention, please.</p>
<p>I need a volunteer for a thankless chore.</p>
<p>Shall I assume the only hand in the air is Lisa Simpson's? Thank you, Lisa.</p>
<p>We have a new student, Lisa, and I want you to show her the works- the lunchroom, the tree.</p>
<p>But when you get to the trophy case, give her some cock-and-bull story.</p>
<p>They're out for cleaning or whatever.</p>
<p>Don't worry. I'll help her out. I remember how hard it was... to be an outsider, always trying to fit in, never quite feeling like-</p>
<p>Lisa, I'd like you to meet Alex Whitney.</p>
<p>Your name's Lisa? Shut up! I love that name.</p>
<p>Did she just tell me to shut up?</p>
<p>Take it outside.</p>
<p>You'll want a locker in this hallway.</p>
<p>It's library-adjacent.</p>
<p>Is that perfume?</p>
<p>Oh! Don't be such a Phoebe.</p>
<p>It's Pretension by Calvin Klein. Wanna try some?</p>
<p>[ Coughing ] Mm-mmm.</p>
<p>Okay. So what's the haps in Springfield?</p>
<p>What do you guys, like, do for fun?</p>
<p>Well, you'll definitely wanna get yourself a good doll.</p>
<p>The new Malibu Stacy has an achievable chest.</p>
<p>Dolls? Really? Okay, what else you got?</p>
<p>Oh.Jacks. Jacks are big.</p>
<p>They went out for a while, but then they came roaring back.</p>
<p>Oh, you mean that game with the little rubber ball?</p>
<p>Oh, don't worry. You'll pick it up fast.</p>
<p>Once you get to foursies, you're in the zone.</p>
<p>Uh-huh. Isn't that trophy case supposed to have trophies?</p>
<p>Uh, they were all wiped out in the big trophy fire.</p>
<p>Ah! I see the trophies are still out for cleaning, eh, Lisa?</p>
<p>[ Chuckling ]</p>
<p>[ Forced Chuckle ]</p>
<p>Okay, boy, this is where all the hard work... sacrifice and painful scaldings pay off.</p>
<p>Four pounds of grease.</p>
<p>That comes to... 63 cents.</p>
<p>Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p>Dad, all that bacon cost $27.</p>
<p>Yeah, but your mom paid for that.</p>
<p>But doesn't she get her money from you?</p>
<p>And I get <em>my</em> money from grease.</p>
<p>What's the problem?</p>
<p>Wow! Look at <em>that</em> load of grease.</p>
<p>Boy, if we're ever gonna earn paper money, we have to expand our operation.</p>
<p>Um, I don't know how much more school I can miss.</p>
<p>Oh, you'll miss plenty. I have a feeling this business... is going to consume our whole lives.</p>
<p>[ Chattering ]</p>
<p>Alex, over here! Okay if the new girl sits with us?</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Okay, I guess.</p>
<p>She's a little weird. But let's give her a chance.</p>
<p>Guys, this is Alex.</p>
<p>[ All Exchanging Greetings ]</p>
<p>Ooh, twins.</p>
<p>Which one is the evil one?</p>
<p><em>[ Laughing ]</em></p>
<p>[ Forced Laughter]</p>
<p>Okay, I'll go get our lunches.</p>
<p>So, Alex-</p>
<p><em>[ Cell Phone Ringing ]</em></p>
<p>Just a sec. Hello?</p>
<p>[ All Gasping ]</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Like I'd be seen with a Discover card.</p>
<p>You have a cell phone?</p>
<p>And a purse!</p>
<p>That's it. Don't be shy.</p>
<p><em>Now maybe a littlejoke to break the ice.</em></p>
<p>[ Laughter]</p>
<p>Or a big joke.</p>
<p><em>Careful now. Nobody likes a show-off.</p>
<p>Where are they going? Hey, wait up.!</em></p>
<p>They left without me.</p>
<p><em>[ Milhouse ] Oh, Lisa?</em></p>
<p>I've got an extra seat, and you've got an extra lunch.</p>
<p>[ Nerdy Laughter] Catch my drift?</p>
<p><em>Milhouse, lower those eyebrows.</p>
<p>And the other one.</em></p>
<p>[ Groans ]</p>
<p>So there I am being nice to Alex... and she takes all of my friends and ditches me.</p>
<p>I'm sure they didn't ditch you, honey.</p>
<p>Maybe they went off to plan a surprise party for you.</p>
<p>[ Laughing ] Oh, yeah. Good one, Mom.</p>
<p>They only like her 'cause she acts so grown-up... with her perfume and her cell phone and-</p>
<p>Oh, and get this, Mom.</p>
<p>She drinks iced tea.</p>
<p>Lisa, I can't imagine anyone being more likable than you.</p>
<p>But, apparently, this new girl is.</p>
<p>So my advice would be to start copying her in every way.</p>
<p>But, Dad-</p>
<p>Uh-uh. Think. Is that what Alex would say?</p>
<p>Oh, there you are. Listen, I'm sorry I ran out on you yesterday... but the girls couldn't wait to show me that tree.</p>
<p>Oh, don't give it a second thought. I didn't.</p>
<p>Anyway, I got you a little present.</p>
<p>Oh, earrings! Wow! Thank you so much, Alex.</p>
<p>Oh. But these are for pierced ears.</p>
<p>Yeah. Aren't they great?</p>
<p>Alex did ours.</p>
<p>Yeah. All you need is a thumbtack and a whole lot of paper towels.</p>
<p>Uh, but I don't think I'm ready for pierced ears.</p>
<p>Well, maybe you can put them on your doll.</p>
<p>[ Laughter]</p>
<p>[ Groans ]</p>
<p>Just kidding, Lise.</p>
<p>I'm sure you'll be ready someday.</p>
<p>Oh, Lisa.</p>
<p>I was hoping I could count on you again... to spearhead our annual school-wide apple pick.</p>
<p>Absolutely!</p>
<p>Apple pick?</p>
<p>Yeah, it's great! We have pony rides, sing-alongs... apple bobbing, apple picking, apple everything.</p>
<p>You forgot apple bobbing.</p>
<p>No, I didn't.</p>
<p>Didn't your old school have apple picks?</p>
<p>No, we weren't big on fruit.</p>
<p>We were more into, like, dances. You know, things that are fun.</p>
<p>A dance? Great idea, Alex.</p>
<p>Yeah! Principal Skinner, can we have a dance instead?</p>
<p>[ Voices Overlapping ]</p>
<p>Well, we've never had a dance before.</p>
<p>Lisa, you'd be doing all the work. What do you think?</p>
<p>I don't know. The ponies might be startled by the loud music.</p>
<p>Well, there wouldn't be ponies.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Then at the risk of being unpopular, I think I'm gonna have to say-</p>
<p>School dance? I didn't approve any school dance.</p>
<p>Yes, you did. Yesterday, right by my locker.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Yes. Um, carry on.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>[ Children Laughing, Shouting ]</p>
<p>When you want grease, go to the source.</p>
<p>Good old Krusty Burger.</p>
<p>Oh, I'll say. Look at that redheaded kid.</p>
<p>There must be $20 worth of grease on his forehead alone.</p>
<p>I was thinking more of the deep fryer.</p>
<p>All right. We'll try it your way.</p>
<p>Can I help you, sir?</p>
<p>My God, you're greasy!</p>
<p>Mr. Maruko, help!</p>
<p>Mom's gonna k*ll you.</p>

<p>Oh, come on, Lisa. It's totally you.</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Oh! I can't believe those g*ons muscled me out of my grease business.</p>
<p>I've been muscled out of everything I've ever done... including my muscle-for-hire business.</p>
<p>My poor Homie. Couldn't you try some other far-out moneymaking scheme?</p>
<p>Ah, what's the point?</p>
<p>You could raise some emus.</p>
<p>Emus? Really?</p>
<p>Oh, that's pretty crazy. Nah.</p>
<p>I'd only fail just like I fail at everything.</p>
<p>Hey, Dad, I've been thinking.</p>
