<p>Lisa, I understand that this family isn't perfect.    </p>
<p>Your mom has her flaws,    </p>
<p>but there are a lot of people who really like her.    </p>
<p>Mom's not the problem.    </p>
<p>[GASPS SOFTLY] So, it's <em>Maggie.</em>    </p>

<p>It will haunt the person I become forever.    </p>
<p>Aw, honey, I'm just as bad as you.    </p>
<p>I coached your father and brother on how to act    </p>

<p>In truth, I moved there when I was two.    </p>
<p>I'm from Cameroon.    </p>
<p>Didn't you wonder why the man I told you was my father    </p>
