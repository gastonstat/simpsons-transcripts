<p>D'oh! [Screams]</p>
<p>[Static]</p>
<p>[Chomping]</p>
<p>[Squeaking]</p>
<p>Marge, can't we get some clear plates? I can't see the TV!</p>
<p>Is it really necessary to watch TV while we're eating?</p>
<p>We're getting food all over.</p>
<p>Yoink!</p>
<p>If you really wanted us to be neater, you'd serve us out of one long bowl.</p>
<p>You're talking about a trough. We're not going to eat from a trough.</p>
<p>And another thing. It's only 5:15.</p>
<p>Why are you in your underwear?</p>
<p>Hey, this ain't the Ritz.</p>
<p>[Groans] At least let's have a civilized conversation, shall we?</p>
<p>Lisa, how was school?</p>
<p>How was what? What?</p>
<p>School! School!</p>
<p>It's not time for school.</p>
<p>I know it's not time- [Groans]</p>
<p>I'm going into the dining room to have a conversation.</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to join me is welcome.</p>
<p><em><strong>Marge</strong>: Hello, Marge. How's the family? I don't want to talk about it!</p>
<p>Mind your own business.</em></p>
<p>Keep it down in there, everybody!</p>
<p>Homer, is this the way you pictured married life?</p>
<p>Yeah, pretty much, except we drove around in a van solving mysteries.</p>
<p>Well, I pictured cocktail parties and candlelit dinners. I pictured napkins.</p>
<p>Homer, I want to throw a dinner party.</p>
<p>Oh, I hate having parties. The toilet always gets backed up.</p>
<p>I don't care if the sink sh**t sludge. We're having a party.</p>
<p>Man, that is flagrant false advertising!</p>
<p>[Gasps] It's just not a dinner party without a melon baller.</p>
<p>And we'll need a citrus zester, a ravioli crimper.</p>
<p>Ooh, an oyster mallet. &quot;Made in U.S.A.&quot;</p>
<p>[Groans] No, thank you.</p>
<p><em>Hey, Lise, check this out. Nonstick coating.</em></p>
<p>Ooh. A punch bowl like that just screams good taste.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be perfect for the dinner party?</p>
<p>Oh, we can't afford that. Who do you think I am, Liz Taylor?</p>
<p>Well, maybe we could use it once and then return it.</p>
<p>Marge, we're not talking about a toothbrush here.</p>
<p>[Groans]</p>
<p>[Beeps]</p>
<p>♪ [Humming]</p>
<p>Bart, company's coming.</p>
<p>Go put doilies under the coasters. Hurry! Hurry!</p>
<p><em>[Dings]</em></p>
<p>Lisa, quick! Screw these back on.</p>
<p>Mom, calm down. The party's not for another three hours.</p>
<p>Oh, good. That will give me time to add another coat of glaze to the ham.</p>
<p>[Groans]</p>
<p>Ohh!</p>
<p>Homer!</p>
<p><em><strong>Homer</strong>: What?</em></p>
<p>Are you ready?</p>
<p>Just gotta put my shoes on.</p>
<p>The only thing I asked you to do for this party was put on clothes... and you didn't do it.</p>
<p><em>[Doorbell Rings]</em></p>
<p>And now it's too late! They're here!</p>
<p>Bart, greet our guests and take their coats.</p>
<p>Mom, Reverend Lovejoy doesn't have a coat. Should I let him in?</p>
<p>My coat was stolen at last week's interfaith banquet.</p>
<p>So I helped myself to a few of the better umbrellas.</p>
<p>Well, as you can see, we don't believe fur is m*rder... but paying for it sure is.</p>
<p>[Laughing]</p>
<p>Uh, sorry we're late. But Luann had to put on her face.</p>
<p>She doesn't want anyone to know she's got no eyebrows. What? You don't.</p>
<p>[All Laughing]</p>
<p>[Chattering]</p>
<p>Did anyone see that new Woodsy Allen movie?</p>
<p>You know, I like his films, except for that nervous fella's always in 'em.</p>
<p>If you want to talk nervous, you should have seen Kirk deal with the high school boys... who egged our Bonneville.</p>
<p>Ha! Should have asked them to hurl some bacon.</p>
<p>Then maybe I could have had a decent breakfast for once.</p>
<p><em>You know what you two need? A little comic strip called</em> Love ls.</p>
<p>It's about two naked eight-year-olds who are married.</p>
<p>Mmm! Well, Marge, if that was my last meal...</p>
<p>I'd tell the warden, &quot;Bring on the lethal injection!&quot;</p>
<p>[Laughing]</p>
<p><em>Yeah, Marge. I know I haven't eaten that well since I was in the army.</em></p>
<p>Or that noisily.</p>
<p>All right, that's it.</p>
<p>So, who wants to play a game? Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?</p>
<p>Oh, that's a noodle-scratcher.</p>
<p><em>Oh! Cornstarch!</em></p>
<p>Oh, rightio!</p>
<p>It's good for keeping down the urges.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, Luann. You know what this is.</p>
<p>Kirk, I don't know what it is.</p>
<p>Oy! It could not be more simple, Luann.</p>
<p>Do you want me to show this to the cat and have the cat tell you what it is?</p>
<p>'Cause the cat's gonna get it.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I'm not as smart as you, Kirk.</p>
<p>We didn't all go to Gudger College.</p>
<p>[Dings]</p>
<p>It's dignity!</p>
<p>Gah! Don't you even know dignity when you see it?</p>
<p>Kirk, you're spitting!</p>
<p>Okay, genius, why don't you draw dignity?</p>
<p>Oh, that's dignity, all right!</p>
<p>That's great!</p>
<p>Worthy of Webster's.</p>
<p>Well, it's no wonder I can't draw dignity. I gave it up when I married <em>her.</em></p>
<p>Now, Kirk, it's only a game. Sometimes we-</p>
<p>Oh, cram it, Churchie!</p>
<p>Maybe we should all have a few drinks.</p>
<p><em>I'd have a drink, but it might loosen my tongue.</em></p>
<p>You want to talk? Go ahead, Luann, talk.</p>
<p>Why don't you tell them one of your little bedtime stories, huh?</p>
<p>Like the one about how rotten it is to be married to a loser.</p>
<p><em>Or how about the one about how I carry a change purse?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, a purse!</p>
<p>Shut up and let the woman talk!</p>
<p>Okay, Kirk, I'll tell a story.</p>
<p>It's about a man whose father-in-law gave him a sweet job... as manager of a cracker factory.</p>
<p><em><strong>Homer</strong>: Boring!</em></p>
<p>A man whose complete lack of business sense and managerial impotence-</p>
<p>Ooh! Here we go! sent the number one cracker factory in town... into a tie for sixth with Table Time and Allied Biscuit.</p>
<p><em>[Kirk] You want to hear a secret, everybody?</p>
<p>Luann loves it! Loves it when I fail!</em></p>
<p>Oh, yes, Kirk. I love having to borrow money from my sister.</p>
<p>I love having to steal clothes from the church donation box.</p>
<p>Oh, sweet Jesus!</p>
<p>[Groaning]</p>
<p>Lisa, why don't you come sing for us?</p>
<p>♪ [Singing]</p>
<p>Oh, great!</p>
<p>You got the kid singing! I hope you're happy now!</p>
<p>I am not happy. And I haven't been happy for a long time.</p>
<p>I want a divorce!</p>
<p>[All Gasping]</p>
<p>I- I- A... divorce?</p>
<p>Sure. Divorce. Hey, you got it, toots!</p>
<p>And here's a picture even <em>you</em> can figure out!</p>
<p>It's a door! Use it!</p>
<p>That's a door?</p>
<p>Hello, I'm Dr Hibbert. I'm afraid I'm going to have to amputate your butt.</p>
<p>[Imitates Hibbert Laughing]</p>
<p>All right, if you think you must.</p>
<p>Come on, Milhouse. We are going.</p>
<p>Oh, can't I come home later?</p>
<p>There's not going to be a home later.</p>
<p>Oh, okay. Ta-ta! I'm off to the beauty salon!</p>
<p>Good night. Thanks for coming. We'll see you. Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Well, I think that went pretty well.</p>
<p>[Tires Screeching]</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I feel terrible. The Van Houtens split up at our party.</p>
<p>Marge, please. That was 20 minutes ago.</p>
<p>I shouldn't have served those North Korean fortune cookies.</p>
<p>They were so insulting- &quot;You are a coward.&quot;</p>
<p>No one likes to hear that after a nice meal.</p>
<p>You can't keep blaming yourself. Just blame yourself once and move on.</p>
<p>You know who the real v*ctim is in all this- Milhouse.</p>
<p>Hey, Van Houten, I heard your folks broke up.</p>
<p>Aren't you gonna say &quot;Ha-ha&quot;?</p>
<p>Oh, by no means. My dad left my mom after she got hooked on cough drops.</p>
<p>By the end, her breath was so fresh... she wasn't really my mother anymore.</p>
<p>Oh. So I guess I'm not alone.</p>
<p><em>Aw, you'll do fine. My divorce was tough on my kid, but he got over it.</em></p>
<p>I sleep in a drawer.</p>

<p>I must say, Luann, you're really handling this splendidly.</p>
<p>From now on, forget everything you thought you knew about Luann Van Houten.</p>
<p>Actually, Luann, I don't really know anything about you.</p>
<p>Forget it! She's gone! Presto change-o!</p>
<p>Kaboom! Sweet Fanny Adams! Bye-bye!</p>
<p>Uh, singles life is great, Homer. I can do whatever I want.</p>
<p>Today I drank a beer in the bathroom.</p>
<p>The one down the hall?</p>
<p>Yeah. And another great thing- you get your own bed.</p>
<p>Uh, I sleep in a racing car. Do you?</p>
<p>I sleep in a big bed with my wife.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><em>[Knocking]</em></p>
<p>Hey, there, Kirk.</p>
<p>Oh, boy! What's going on? Patio party?</p>
<p>Nah. A possum drowned in the pool. You have any garbage bags?</p>
<p>Ah, just throw it over the fence. Let Arby's worry about it.</p>
<p>That's Jerry. He's a major player down at the sewing store.</p>
<p>Well, thanks for introducing me.</p>
<p>Ah, don't worry, Homer. You know me.</p>
<p>And I'm a superstar at the cracker factory.</p>
<p><em>[Kirk] You're letting me go?</em></p>
<p>Kirk, crackers are a family food. Happy families.</p>
<p>Maybe single people eat crackers. We don't know.</p>
<p>Frankly, we don't want to know. It's a market we can do without.</p>
<p>So that's it after 20 years- so long, good luck?</p>
<p>I don't recall saying &quot;good luck.&quot;</p>
<p>[Imitating Engine]</p>
<p>And the winner of the Milhouse 500 is Milhouse!</p>
<p><em>[Luann] Milhouse, are you sure you want to drive that inside?</em></p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p><em>Okay. Be careful, sweet, sweet treasure.</p>
<p>[Doorbell Rings]</em></p>
<p>God, I missed you, Lulu.</p>
<p>[Giggles] Chase, it's only been three hours.</p>
<p>Who's Chase?</p>
<p>Oh, that's Mom's new boyfriend.</p>
<p>Hey, I know you from <em>American Gladiators.</em> You're Pyro!</p>
<p>[Laughs] Only on weekends.</p>
<p>During the week, I'm just your average workaday stuntman.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Go ahead. Break a chair on me.</p>
<p>Wow! Thanks.</p>
<p>Okay, boys, I gotta go. Come on, Lulu. Let's roll.</p>
<p>♪ [Whistling]</p>
<p>Ow! Ow!</p>
<p>Ow! What the hell is wrong with you?</p>
<p>Gee! Sorry! It's a pretty standard stunt, Homer.</p>
<p><em><strong>Marge</strong>: Homer, get ready!</em></p>
<p>For what?</p>
<p><em>Remember? Luann and Chase are taking us out to hear Spalding Gray.</em></p>
<p>I don't want to go to that.</p>
<p><em>You said you'd do it as a favor to me.</em></p>
<p>That doesn't sound like something I'd say.</p>
<p><em>Fine. I'll go without you.</em></p>
<p>Okay. Love ya!</p>
<p><em>[Door Slams Shut]</em></p>
<p>Homer, I want you to meet my new special lady. Say hello to Starla.</p>
<p>[Cigarette Hisses]</p>
<p>[Gulping]</p>
<p>Can I have the keys to the car, lover? I feel like changing wigs.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Starla's a temp at KZUG, radio 530.</p>
<p>She's gonna help me launch my singing career.</p>
<p><em>[Tires Screeching]</em></p>
<p>My car!</p>
<p>Oh, my demo tape!</p>
<p>&quot;Can I Borrow a Feeling?&quot; [Laughing]</p>
<p>&quot;Can I Borrow a Feeling?&quot;</p>
<p>It's your picture on the front.</p>
<p>Go ahead, Homer. Laugh at me.</p>
<p>I already did.</p>
<p>[Sighs] You know why all this happened, don't ya?</p>
<p>'Cause I took my marriage for granted.</p>
<p>You know, in 12 years, I never once helped out with the housework.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, you gotta do that.</p>
<p>I could have at least stayed in shape for her.</p>
<p>Oh, and for yourself.</p>
<p>I could have taken just a little time to- to make her feel special.</p>
<p>It can't just be sex. It can't!</p>
<p>God, I was so self-centered! No wonder I didn't see it coming.</p>
<p>That's how it is though. One day your wife is making you your favorite meal... the next day, you're thawing a hot dog in a gas station sink.</p>
<p>Oh, that's tough, pal. But it's never gonna happen to me.</p>
<p>Well, how do you know? What makes you guys so special?</p>
<p>'Cause Marge and I have one thing that can never be broken- a strong marriage built on a solid foundation of routine.</p>
<p>Marge, I'm home! Where are you?</p>
<p>Are you okay? I don't smell dinner.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear Homer.&quot; Ahh.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry you didn't want to join me tonight. I left you hot dogs for dinner.</p>
<p>They're thawing in the sink.&quot;</p>
<p>[Screams]</p>
<p>Hi, Dad.</p>
<p>You know, there's buns in the cabinet.</p>
<p>Lisa, wait!</p>
<p>I know you're only eight years old, and I don't want to put a lot of pressure on you... but you've got to save my marriage!</p>
<p>Oh, okay? Can I stay up?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>[Clears Throat] As you know, there's been a lot of talk about divorce lately.</p>
<p>And I think your mom might not be happy with me.</p>
<p>You've done a lot of crazy stuff over the years and she's stood by you.</p>
<p>Why would she leave you now?</p>
<p>Because there's lots of stuff she doesn't know about!</p>
<p>You mean, like your poker shack out in the swamp?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>She knows.</p>
<p>Oh, I knew this would happen.</p>
<p>Our whole marriage started off on the wrong foot.</p>
<p><em>Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God and this casino tojoin-</em></p>
<p>Homer. and-</p>
<p>Marge. in holy matrimony.</p>
<p>By the power vested in me by the state gaming commission, I pronounce you man and wife.</p>
<p>Here's $10 worth of chips.</p>
<p>You may kiss the bride.</p>
<p>See? You don't have to spend a lot of money to have a first-class wedding reception.</p>
<p><em>[Marge Sighs]</em></p>
<p>It's getting less and less likely... you're going to yell &quot;surprise&quot; and have all my friends jump out.</p>
<p>Levis. Hey, you think that truck is full of jeans?</p>
<p>You're very lucky to have Mom.</p>
<p>That's your advice? Go to bed!</p>
<p><em>[Footsteps]</em></p>
<p>Good morning!</p>
<p>You know, Marge, I was thinking about how much I enjoy your interests.</p>
<p>So I wandered over to that theater you went to last night... and I bought tickets to their entire season.</p>
<p>Look, <em>&quot;Mostly Madrigal. '&quot;</em> Uh, that might be good.</p>
<p>Oh! Oh, <em>&quot;A n Evening with Philip Glass.</em> '&quot;Just an evening?</p>
<p>&quot;Voices of the Elderly, '&quot;[/i] or- Hmm.</p>
<p>Homie, I appreciate this.</p>
<p>But I'd really like to get some sleep.</p>
<p>Oh, of course, my sweet. I'll just make some soothing ocean sounds for you.</p>
<p>[Imitates Wind Blowing]</p>
<p>[Imitates Fog Horn]</p>
<p>[Imitates Bird Squawking]</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Arr, Matey!</p>
<p>♪ [Humming]</p>
<p>Armando, don't you think you're taking a lot off-</p>
<p>[Screams] Homer, what are you doing?</p>
<p>I wanted to surprise you with a kicky summer do.</p>
<p>How many husbands would do that for their wives?</p>
<p>None! They'd have more sense than that!</p>
<p>Oh, you're feisty. I'm gonna give you a Madonna cut.</p>
<p>Homer, I don't need you around me 24 hours a day!</p>
<p>I'm a grown woman! I can take care of myself!</p>
<p>Now, would you please just go away?</p>
<p>Oh, I just made things worse.</p>
<p>A few clumsy gestures aren't gonna make up for 10 years of neglect.</p>
<p>Marge deserves someone who will treat her right.</p>
<p>Marge deserves a fresh start.</p>
<p>I'd like to file for... divorce.</p>
<p>These things happen. Eight dollars.</p>
<p>Only three cavities, Bart. Your best checkup ever.</p>
<p>I'm going to make you my specialty- butterscotch chicken.</p>
<p><em><strong>Homer</strong>: Marge, can you come in here? We need to talk.</em></p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p><em>[People] Surprise!</em></p>
<p>[Gasps]</p>
<p>[Chuckles]</p>
<p>Surprise.</p>
<p>Marge, will you marry me?</p>
<p>Why? Am I pregnant?</p>
<p>No. It's a second wedding, honey.</p>
<p>Our first one was so crummy, I had to make it up to you. I really love you.</p>
<p>Oh, Homie. I know you love me.</p>
<p>We don't need to get married again.</p>
<p>Yes, we do!</p>
<p>I got us a divorce this afternoon.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I didn't want a hokey second wedding like those ones on TV.</p>
<p>This one is for real. I want our marriage to be perfect right from the start... so we don't end up like Kirk and Luann.</p>
<p>We never will.</p>
<p>Dearly beloved-</p>
<p>Wait! I want one last chance to enjoy single life.</p>
<p>[Belches] Okay, ready.</p>
<p>I will now read the special vows which Homer has prepared... for this occasion.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you, Marge, take Homer in richness and in poorness-&quot; &quot; Poorness&quot; is underlined-</p>
<p>&quot;in impotence and in potence, in quiet solitude... or blasting across the alkali flats in a jet-powered, monkey navigated-&quot;</p>
<p>And it goes on like this.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter. All I want to know is... will you make me the luckiest guy in the world again?</p>
<p>I will.</p>
<p>Oh, Homie, of course I will.</p>
<p>[Grunting] Come on, you stupid-There.</p>
<p>By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife.</p>
<p>It's the most perfect wedding I could ever ask for.</p>
<p>You've even got a hip rock-and-roll combo.</p>
<p>Okay, everybody, who likes The Doobie Brothers? 'Cause we got one of them.</p>
<p>♪ [Romantic Jazz]</p>
<p>What a wonderful evening.</p>
<p>A magical way for two people to renew their love.</p>
<p>[Gulping] Marge is right.</p>
<p>Uh, I've got something I'd like to say.</p>
<p>♪ [Stops]</p>
<p>Would you guys do a favor for a guy in love?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That's why we're here.</p>
<p><em>[Kirk] Uh, hi, everybody. Uh, hi.</em></p>
<p>And... hit it!</p>
<p>♪ [Romantic]</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>♪ [Singing]</p>
<p>♪ [Stops]</p>
<p>How about it, Luann? Will you marry me... again?</p>
<p>Ooh, no!</p>
<p>Oh. Well, uh, can I have my shirts back at least?</p>
<p>Okay, you heard the lady. Why don't you take it outside, all right?</p>
<p>Uh, I'll be back...</p>
<p><em>pr-probably.</em></p>
<p>[Murmuring]</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
