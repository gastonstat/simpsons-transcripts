<p>Krusty clearly hates being there, but he still gets super mad when anyone but him talks.  </p>
<p>Please welcome the legendary stars of the<em> Krusty the Clown Show.</em>  </p>
<p>[CHEERING]  </p>
<p>Hey-hey!  </p>
<p>And a non-writing producer.   </p>
<p>Ooh, non-writing.   </p>
<p>Hey-hey, kids!   </p>
<p>ALL: Hey-hey, Krusty!   </p>
<p>Have we got a great panel planned for you today.   </p>
<p>What is it, Howard, the usual crap?   </p>
<p>Oh, yeah, that'll k*ll some time.   </p>
<p>[AUDIENCE SCREAMS]   </p>
<p>[GRUNTING]   </p>
<p>Kids, call the police!<br />
This isn't a sketch!   </p>
<p>[GROANS]   </p>
<p>Ah.   </p>
<p>My legs!   </p>
<p>Stick to the script.   </p>
<p>[STRAINING]: Ladies and gentlemen,   </p>
<p>Miami Sound Machine.   </p>
<p>♪ <em>Come on, shake...</em> ♪   </p>
<p>Where do you come up with your ideas?   </p>
<p>I'm a genius. Next.   </p>
<p>- Are there any plans...<br />
- BOTH: For another Krusty movie?   </p>
<p>We're waiting for a story that needs to be told.   </p>
<p>Once we see that, we'll copy it and call it a parody.   </p>
<p>Oy. Does anyone have a question that hasn't been asked a thousand times?   </p>
<p>I have the worst fans in the world.   </p>
<p>Now we've got a big surprise for the best fans in the world!   </p>
<p>We're making some big changes to your favorite cartoon.   </p>
<p>- [AUDIENCE GASPS]<br />
- MAN: It's different.   </p>
<p>It's an all-female reboot of<em> Itchy &amp; Scratchy!</em>   </p>
<p>BOTH: Oh, my God!   </p>
<p>Pretty enlightened, eh, kids?<br />
We here at the<em> Krusty Show</em> really care about gender diversity.   </p>
<p>Ask anyone: our lawyers, our attorneys, anyone.   </p>
<p>A girl<em> Itchy &amp; Scratchy?</em>   </p>
<p>No, no, no, this can't be.   </p>
<p>They've ruined my childhood.   </p>
<p>Your childhood is currently happening.   </p>
<p>That's how I know.   </p>
<p>It doesn't make any sense.   </p>
<p>In real life, Itchy and Scratchy are dudes.   </p>
<p>Girl mice don't have the upper body strength to wield a chain saw.   </p>
<p>Is truth dead?   </p>
<p>BOYS: Boo!   </p>
<p>Ah, you boys are leaving me for video games anyway.   </p>
<p>Zap, zap, zap, you'll all die alone.   </p>
<p>Girl power is where it's at.   </p>
<p>That movie where Superman was a chick made a megillah of shekels.<br />
Am I right, ladies?   </p>
<p>[GIRLS CHEERING]   </p>
<p>See? Girls like my pandering.   </p>
<p>Remember this if there's ever a gender w*r.   </p>
<p>Oh, this is the worst change   </p>
<p>Krusty's ever made to the show, even worse than Sideshow Leonard Cohen.   </p>
<p>When girl<em> Itchy &amp; Scratchy</em> comes on, we should totally hate-watch it.   </p>
<p>No, everybody come over to my house, and we'll turn off the TV the second that girl cartoon comes on.   </p>
<p>We'll hate-not-watch it.   </p>
<p>Yeah! Hate-not-watch!   </p>
<p>Yeah, that won't not show 'em.   </p>
<p>I never really thought about Itchy and Scratchy as male or female, but it is cool that they're girls now.   </p>
<p>I always thought they were a married couple, and that's why they fought so much.   </p>
<p>Mom, they're different species.   </p>
<p>I don't know what to be liberal about anymore.   </p>
<p>I am so pumped to hate-not-watch <em>Itchy &amp; Scratchy.</em>   </p>
<p>I've not popped the popcorn, the lights are not turned down.   </p>
<p>Perfect.   </p>
<p>Listen, son, I'm proud that you're starting to hate things, but take it slow.   </p>
<p>If you use up all your hate when you're young, one day you'll be an old man who likes things that suck.   </p>
<p><em>ANNOUNCER [ON TV]: Tonight, cabbage.</em>   </p>
<p><em>It is a lovely shade of gray,</em>   </p>
<p><em>and just look at the wrinklin.</em>   </p>
<p>All I'm saying is, if they ever make a female Mr. Magoo,   </p>
<p>I will lose it, I will just lose it!   </p>
<p><em>KRUSTY [ON TV]: Hey-hey, kids!</em>   </p>
<p>It's time to tickle your funny bones and your Equal Employment Opportunity Commission bones   </p>
<p><em>by presenting the all-new, all-female</em>   </p>
<p>Itchy &amp; Scratchy!   </p>
<p>Now to sit in silence till it's over.   </p>

<p>I-I wasn't laughing.    </p>
<p>I-I was crying a-and burping!    </p>

<p>Never gonna happen.    </p>
<p>- [GRUNTING]<br />
- Yeah.    </p>
<p>That little liar. If only people could know that Bart laughed even harder than I did...    </p>
<p>[GASPS]    </p>
<p>All right, you soda-squirting hypocrite, I know exactly what to do with this video.    </p>

<p><em>[LAUGHING]</em>    </p>

<p>And I'm still doing it!    </p>
<p>Look at you.    </p>
<p>What a jerk.    </p>
<p>[BART GROANS]    </p>
<p>Well, Bart, how does it feel to be trolled, memed, giffed, and, dare I say, pwned?    </p>
<p>How do you know those words?    </p>
<p>I read about them in<em> Parade</em> magazine.    </p>
<p>Big deal, I was exposed as a liar on the Internet.    </p>
<p>I've got so much cred built up, nothing can take me down.    </p>
<p>You betrayed us, Bart.    </p>
<p>And worse, you betrayed your own wang.    </p>
<p>You know what?<br />
Yes, I laughed at a cartoon.    </p>
<p>Why? Because it was funny.    </p>
<p>So what if Itchy and Scratchy are girls?    </p>
<p>I laughed, and you can't take back the laugh.    </p>
<p>Girls aren't funny.    </p>
<p>They're hot or moms.    </p>
<p>Or both.    </p>
<p>Girls stole Itchy and Scratchy.    </p>
<p>What are they gonna take next, our body spray?    </p>
<p>Our puka shell necklaces?    </p>
<p>- Yeah!<br />
- Lame!    </p>
<p>Girls get everything: bigger, softer baseballs, chick flicks, two-piece bathing suits, and on<em> House Hunters International,</em> they always choose the house that she wants.    </p>
<p>He's right.<br />
The wife gets the beach view, but it's always a longer commute for the husband.    </p>

<p><em>BROCKMAN: Springfield,</em> a town living in fear, as masked pranksters calling themselves &quot;Bossy Riot,&quot; spread their terrifying message of female empowerment.    </p>
<p>The latest v*ctim of this &quot;gal Qaeda,&quot; our once-proud symbol of the portly pastry-purveying patriarchy.    </p>
<p>HOMER: &quot;Lard Lady&quot;?    </p>
<p>But a donut is the ultimate symbol of masculinity.    </p>
<p>The only lead police have as to the identity of Bossy Riot is this security camera footage.    </p>
<p>[HOMER LAUGHS]    </p>
<p>HOMER: Moe and his bats.    </p>
<p>Bossy Riot is so cool.    </p>
<p>We need fearless female activists to fight back against misogyny and man-spreading.    </p>
<p>Well, whoever they are, they are the coolest badasses this town has ever seen, whoever they are.    </p>
<p>Ooh, Bart winked at me.    </p>
<p>I must be in on a joke. [CHUCKLES]    </p>
<p>- [BART HUMMING]<br />
- Hmm...    </p>
<p>- [SCREAMS]<br />
- Bart, are you in Bossy Riot?    </p>
<p>- No way.<br />
- Ah, good.    </p>
<p>Because if you were fighting for women's rights, it would destroy my entire vision of the universe.    </p>
<p>- Actually, I totally am.<br />
- [SHOUTS]    </p>
<p>You can't be an activist for women's rights.    </p>
<p>You don't know anything about the feminist cause.    </p>
<p>Sure I do. Chicks get a raw deal.    </p>
<p>I'm a little fuzzy on the deets, but take my word for it.    </p>
<p>[GROANS] It's all about the deets. You're not a girl.    </p>
<p>You just want to spray-paint the world and watch it drip.    </p>
<p>You've never been called shrill just because you speak up.    </p>
<p>And-and girls' clothing has no pockets, while yours are lousy with pockets!    </p>
<p>This is good stuff, I got to write it down.    </p>
<p>[BART HUMMING]    </p>
<p>This is someone else's w*r, and you, y-you're just a mercenary.    </p>
<p>Mercenaries are cool, like Boba Fett.    </p>
<p>Oh, yeah, Boba Fett, great character.    </p>
<p>Boba Fett's badass. He wears a jetpack and a cape.    </p>
<p>Pick a lane, weirdo.    </p>
<p>Why does every discussion about feminism turn into an argument about<em> Star Wars?</em>    </p>
<p>If Boba Fett's such a great bounty hunter, why is his armor all banged up?    </p>
<p>[SIGHS] It's a look, like distressed denim.    </p>
<p>You shouldn't be part of a protest if you don't care about the cause.    </p>
<p>Well, you care. Why don't you come with?    </p>
<p>Maybe I will.    </p>
<p>Great. Bring black gloves and no ID.    </p>
<p>You've been Tasered before, right?    </p>
<p>It only hurts until you pass out.    </p>
<p>I'm excited; I want to, I do, but...there's a part of me that's scared, and that part is my body and my head.    </p>
<p>It's okay, I get it.    </p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with being all talk.    </p>
<p>Us feminists need cheerleaders, too.    </p>
<p>[GROANS]    </p>
<p>So, what's up, my fellow Ruthless Bader Ginsburgs?    </p>
<p>What's on the a-gender for the evening?    </p>
<p>Your friends in the so-called &quot;Boys Rights Association&quot; have been protesting <em>The Krusty Show.</em>    </p>
<p><em>I told you not to light the toys yet.</em>    </p>
<p><em>I didn't, they just burst into flames.</em>    </p>
<p>Krusty caved. He said he'd never show another all-girl <em>Itchy &amp; Scratchy</em> ever again.    </p>
<p>So we're gonna destroy the master tapes of every<em> Itchy &amp; Scratchy.</em>    </p>
<p>Wait, what? No.    </p>
<p>I love those cartoons.    </p>
<p>I can't let you do it.    </p>
<p>Oh, you can't &quot;let&quot; us?    </p>
<p>Don't have a lady cow.    </p>
<p>All cows are ladies.    </p>
<p>That thing you said about me being all talk?    </p>
<p>Well, I have prepared two comebacks, and I will now give you both.    </p>
<p>Those girls are gonna destroy every<em> Itchy &amp; Scratchy,</em> forever!    </p>
<p>[GRUNTING]    </p>
<p>Hey, hey, boys and boys!    </p>
<p>Well, congratulations, I'm never gonna air the girl <em>Itchy &amp; Scratchy</em> again.    </p>
<p>You hit me where it hurts the most: right in the sponsors.    </p>
<p>Buy 'em all.    </p>
<p>[GASPS] We're too late.    </p>
<p>They're going to destroy the tapes on live TV.    </p>
<p>Let's get him out of those bras and go.    </p>
<p>Uh, no, you can leave me like this. I'm good.    </p>
<p>We are Bossy Riot, and we're gonna drop all the original<em> Itchy &amp; Scratchys</em> into a pool of nail polish remover.    </p>
<p>[ALL GASPING]    </p>
<p>That's crazy. We have those backed up a thousand times.    </p>
<p>Right, Howard?    </p>
<p>What do you do?!    </p>
<p>Don't do it. Those shows are funny.    </p>
<p>Mice k*ll cats, guts everywhere.    </p>
<p>It doesn't matter if it's boy guts or girl guts.    </p>
<p>Guts are guts.    </p>
<p>See, the thing about comedy is...    </p>
<p>Bart, stop mansplaining!    </p>
<p>No, no, no, no, if I keep talking, they'll get it eventually.    </p>
<p>[GRUNTS]    </p>
<p>The fumes are burning my eyes.    </p>
<p>[ALL CRYING]    </p>
<p>Look, they're crying, on live TV.    </p>
<p>Glitterize their tears.    </p>
<p>Mama!    </p>
<p>Don't worry, sir, your brothers are united in blaming this on you.    </p>

<p>Hey, hey! Come back here!    </p>
<p>You there, sweet innocent girls, did you see three crazed man-haters run through here?    </p>
<p>Gee, Officer, they went that way.    </p>

<p>Great. Be at my house Saturday at  :  .    </p>

<p>So I guess I'm not in the group anymore.    </p>
<p>You were never<em> in</em> the group.    </p>
<p>We just kept you around for fingerprints and DNA.    </p>
<p>But making those boys cry was hardcore.    </p>
