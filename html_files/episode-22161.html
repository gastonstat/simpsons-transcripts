<p>[WHISTLE BLOWING]</p>
<p>[BEEPING]</p>
<p>[LISA PLAYS SOLO]</p>
<p>D'oh! Ah!</p>
<p>Dad, it's so enlightened of you to take us to a WNBA game.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, nachos are nachos.</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong>: Over here. Over here.</p>
<p>Whoa, check out Janeane Giraffalo.</p>
<p>That's Fung Pang-Li, the 7-foot sensation from Szechwan.</p>
<p>Szechwan, eh? No wonder she's so spicy.</p>
<p>[GROWLS]</p>
<p>Bart, you're a little young to be growling at 7-foot Chinese ladies.</p>
<p>Fine. I'll go back to being bored.</p>
<p>Wow, I wonder what it would be like to be with a woman like that.</p>
<p>[GASPS]</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>Mm...</p>
<p>Far-fetched...</p>
<p>Ha, ha.</p>
<p>Look, that's Lisa Leslie.</p>
<p>She showed little girls everywhere that they can grow up to be 6'5&quot;.</p>
<p>Lisa Leslie, you got game.</p>
<p>I think you mean I have game.</p>
<p>Try to speak correctly.</p>
<p>You go, girl.</p>
<p>Yes, I will depart lest your bad grammar rub off on me.</p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: <em>Now, here's something for the men to dribble over.</p>
<p>Our mascot, Swish.</em></p>
<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>
<p>Oh, I can see her logo and everything.</p>
<p>Oh, heh.</p>
<p>Ha, ha. Hey, come back. Hey, I love you.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Aw.</p>
<p>Oh, darn it. Swish was everything I'm not.</p>
<p>Put the head back on.</p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: <em>And now it's time for our $50,000 half-court sh*t.</p>
<p>The winning fan is in section A.</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: <em>Row 12.</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: <em>Seat 16.</em></p>
<p>Woo-hoo!</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Praise the Lord. My seat has scored.</p>
<p>Dad, this ticket is for tomorrow's WNFL game.</p>
<p><strong>Bart</strong>: The Cowgirls versus The She-gles. Heh.</p>
<p>No love lost there.</p>
<p>Unh.</p>
<p>Thanks for supporting the WNBA, sir.</p>
<p>You betcha. It's a nice break from the male sports I usually watch.</p>
<p>You like male sports?</p>
<p>Oh, sure. Speed walking, ballroom dancing... rhythmic gymnastics, extreme choir.</p>
<p>Just hurry up and miss.</p>
<p>Lord, make my sh*t straight and true.</p>
<p>Huh? Huh? Huh?</p>
<p>[GROANS]</p>
<p>Can't we just pretend you're really a girl?</p>
<p>Well, for how long?</p>
<p>For the rest of our lives.</p>
<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Gosh, $50,000. I'm donating this whole check to Bibles for Belgians.</p>
<p>I'm the owner of this here team.</p>
<p>I wanna reward your generous attitude... with this check for a hundred thousand dollars.</p>
<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>
<p>I'm crazy as a crap-house rat for philanthropy.</p>
<p>Hee-haw! Hee-Haw!</p>
<p>[LAUGHS]</p>
<p>I'm sorry, sir. Your car is still blocked in.</p>
<p>Well, heh, I guess Flanders doesn't have all the luck.</p>
<p>So we'll let you drive home in the Wienermobile.</p>
<p>Well, hot dog.</p>
<p><strong>Rod &amp; Todd [in unison]</strong>: Yay!</p>
<p>That cuts the mustard with me.</p>
<p>Oh, it's not fair. I always wanted to drive a food-shaped car.</p>
<p>Heh, the steering wheel is a giant onion ring.</p>
<p>They thought of everything.</p>
<p>[CRYING]</p>
<p>How come all the good things happen to Jesus H. Nice?</p>
<p>By which I mean Flanders.</p>
<p>[CRYING CONTINUES]</p>
<p>[MARGE HUMMING]</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: D'oh!</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: D'oh!</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: D'oh!</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>D'oh! D'oh!</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>The grass is actually greener on Flanders' side.</p>
<p>That's because you keep passing out on our lawn.</p>
<p>[CROW CAWS]</p>
<p>No, that's not it. He's got some secret.</p>
<p>And I'm gonna find out what it is, no matter what it takes.</p>
<p>Flanders, what's your secret?</p>
<p>You never get arrested, don't buy clothes at Mister Blob... and look at your beautiful lawn. It sickens me.</p>
<p>Well, heh, whatever I've got, I owe to hard work, honest living... and flossing my teeth, tail and toes. Plus a prayer now and then.</p>
<p>So that's all it takes.</p>
<p>A little prayer.</p>
<p><strong>Man (on tv)</strong>: <em>And now </em>Ken Burns.</p>
<p>A documentary by Ken Burns about the life of Ken Burns.[/i]</p>
<p>Ew! Where's the remote?</p>
<p><strong>Narrator (over tv)</strong>: <em>Ever since he was a young man...</p>
<p>Ken Burns has loved two things.</p>
<p>Baseball and jazz.</p>
<p>They so consumed my life... I never had time for a proper haircut.</em></p>
<p>Well, if I don't have the remote... I can just get up and change the channel.</p>
<p>[HOMER WHINES]</p>
<p>[GASPS]</p>
<p>Wait a minute. I'll do what Flanders does.</p>
<p>Oh, merciful God... who has blessed mankind with two kinds of clam chowder... help me find the remote.</p>
<p>[GASPS]</p>
<p>There it is.</p>
<p><em>I've never actually been to a baseball game.</p>
<p>The fresh air gives me hives.</em></p>
<p><strong>Homer (yelling)</strong>: Die monster!</p>
<p><strong>Man (on tv)</strong>: <em>You're watching Monkey Olympics on Fox.</em></p>
<p>It worked. I got my wish.</p>
<p>From now on, I'll pray till my hands are chapped and bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>Announcer (on tv)</strong>: <em>5.2, 5.2, 5.2, 5.1, 5.3.</em></p>
<p>[MONKEY GIBBERING]</p>
<p><strong>Commentator 1 [on tv]</strong>: <em>Ooh, low marks. I've never seen Noodles this mad.</em></p>
<p><strong>Commentator 2 [on tv]</strong>: <em>She's throwing her diaper at the judges.</em></p>
<p>Oh, Lord. Please guide that diaper into someone's schnoz.</p>
<p>[SPLATS]</p>
<p>Ah, yes.</p>
<p>[HOMER HUMMING]</p>
<p>Hmm. Vengeful God, loving God.</p>
<p>Vengeful God, loving God.</p>
<p>Vengeful God, loving God.</p>
<p>Vengeful God, loving God. Ha, ha.</p>
<p>I could do this all day and I just might.</p>
<p>Vengeful God, loving God.</p>
<p>Vengeful God, loving God.</p>
<p>Setting up a prayer station, eh, Homer?</p>
<p>I used to think God only helped professional athletes... and Grammy winners.</p>
<p>But now I realize he helps shmoes like me too, Carl.</p>
<p>Makes sense to me.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, did you see the judging in the monkey figure skating?</p>
<p>Whose banana you gotta peel to get a 5.9? Pfft!</p>
<p>Could not believe that.</p>
<p>Dear Lord, as I think of you, dressed in white with your splendid beard... I am reminded of Colonel Sanders who is now seated at your right hand... shoveling popcorn chicken into thy mouth.</p>
<p>Lord, could you come up with a delicious new treat like he did?</p>
<p>I command you.</p>
<p><strong>Truck Driver</strong>: Hey, watch it.</p>
<p>[HORN HONKS &amp; TIRES SCREECH]</p>
<p>Oh, fudge!</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>Mm... Move over, eggs.</p>
<p>Bacon just got a new best friend: fudge.</p>
<p>Oh, heavenly God, my son is plagued with homework.</p>
<p>With your vast knowledge of <em>&quot;The Shore Birds of Maryland&quot;...</em> I know you can help him.</p>
<p>Homer, God isn't some kind of holy concierge.</p>
<p>You can't keep bugging him for every little thing.</p>
<p>Can and will. Now, to unstop the sink.</p>
<p>Lord, please use your space-age clog- busting powers on this stubborn drain... then take some time off for yourself.</p>
<p>Fly to France, have dinner.</p>
<p>I'll just call a plumber.</p>
<p>[PHONE DIALING]</p>
<p>Oh, Lord, I see thou art working through thy imperfect vessel, Marge... for thou art most wise...</p>
<p>You know, most people pray silently.</p>
<p>Marge, he's way the hell up there.</p>
<p><strong>Plumber</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>Hmm, I'm afraid I've got bad news.</p>
<p>Trees have gotten into your plumbing.</p>
<p>How bad is it?</p>
<p>Your pipes have more roots than the list of all time top-rated TV shows.</p>
<p>Oh, well, we could live with a stopped-up drain.</p>
<p>I don't think that moisture's gonna do wonders for your drywall.</p>
<p>And it ain't in such great shape as it is.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>You was hiding behind the drywall.</p>
<p>Yes, you were. I'm glad social services didn't see this. Yes, I am.</p>
<p>[COUGHS]</p>
<p>Oh, you coughed up some drywall.</p>
<p>[ORGAN PLAYING]</p>
<p>Lord, this is a dire emergency.</p>
<p>If you could fix my house... or make a new house from one of my ribs.</p>
<p>[SCREAMS]</p>
<p>Dad, are you hurt?</p>
<p>I think my leg is broken.</p>
<p>Slip and fall? Can't go back to work?</p>
<p>I'm Larry H. Lawyer, Junior. And I will fight for you.</p>
<p>I also <em>habla Español.</em></p>
<p>So that's your answer. I'll sue the church.</p>
<p>Homer, we can't sue the church.</p>
<p>They'll poke fun at us in the church bulletin.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be the first time.</p>
<p>I couldn't help it. Those pews are so comfortable.</p>
<p>You have rights. You deserve financial compensation.</p>
<p>He got me $60,000. And I was driving drunk in a graveyard.</p>
<p>Now, you're my first client who actually is injured.</p>
<p>According to this book, that's a big plus.</p>
<p>Homer, please don't sue the church.</p>
<p>I'm asking you as your friend and neighbor.</p>
<p>Can I borrow your pen to sign this?</p>
<p>Okely-dokely.</p>
<p>[GROANS]</p>
<p>Why do I always give in to him?</p>
<p>It's his skull. It's hypnotic.</p>
<p>Now, hearing <em>Homer Simpson v. The First Church of Springfield.</em></p>
<p>Morning, judge. How is your lovely wife?</p>
<p>She was run over by a clergyman.</p>
<p>[GULPS]</p>
<p>We're very sorry for the v*ctim's injury.</p>
<p>But as this tape demonstrates, Mr. Simpson is accident-prone.</p>
<p><em>I can't see anything in this fog.</em></p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>[GRUNTING]</p>
<p>[ALL LAUGHING]</p>
<p>Ha, ha, Your Honor, we the jury find that to be <em>America's Funniest Home Video.</em></p>
<p>Back to you, Bob Saget.</p>
<p>This is a court of law.</p>
<p>Okey-doke. We find for Mr. Simpson in the sum of $1 million.</p>
<p>Woo-hoo!</p>
<p>Can I get that in lottery tickets?</p>
<p>Well, Your Honor, we don't have that kind of money.</p>
<p>We're not a synagogue.</p>
<p>In that case, I award Mr. Simpson the deed to the church.</p>
<p>You're giving him the church?</p>
<p>He's not giving it to me. God is because I prayed for it.</p>
<p>Dad, I think this might be the work of Satan.</p>
<p>It's all good.</p>
<p>[GRUNTS]</p>
<p>Homer, for the last time, please give the church back.</p>
<p>[CHURCH BELLS TOLLING]</p>
<p>That is gonna drive me nuts.</p>
<p>Look. This church is our only option.</p>
<p>Don't you kids wanna live here?</p>
<p>Anything's better than that dump we came from.</p>
<p>And there's so many places to cloister myself.</p>
<p>The dog's onboard too.</p>
<p>Aw, he thinks he's papal.</p>
<p>[GROANS]</p>
<p>Well, the court has spoken, so here you go.</p>
<p>The baptismal font tends to run. You have to jiggle the handle.</p>
<p>Oh, and Wednesday is garbage day.</p>
<p>Sweet.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry, Reverend.</p>
<p>Oh, it's not so bad. We'll be staying with the Flanders'.</p>
<p>And, Rev, you'll be bunking with me.</p>
<p>Oh, boy, does he ever...</p>

<p>Wherever shall we go?</p>
<p>Uh, you can come to my church.</p>
<p>And what church might that be?</p>
<p>Saint Pauli Girl's Cathedral.</p>
<p>Oh, I've heard of them.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay. Let's go there.</p>
<p>Homer, that was not very Christian of you.</p>
<p>You're right. I'll make it up... by throwing the bitchingest beer bash this church has ever seen.</p>
<p>Bless you.</p>
<p>Bless you. How're you doing?</p>
<p>Wow, Homer, this is like a party Dick Clark would throw.</p>
<p>Yeah. Fun, but not too fun.</p>
<p>So where's Marge?</p>
<p>Uh, she went to Lovejoy's temporary church.</p>
<p>She's worried about her immortal soul.</p>
<p>[PINS CRASHING]</p>

<p>As I was saying, if we keep our hearts pure, we can...</p>
<p>Dr. Hibbert, must you play the claw machine?</p>
<p>I'll be right there. I've almost got me a kitty cat.</p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]</p>
<p>[GROANS]</p>
<p>I really enjoyed your sermon.</p>
<p>Particularly the part about the pin in the gutter on lane 15.</p>
<p>Ugh, that wasn't me. That was the manager.</p>
<p>Are you sure? Because it really spoke to me.</p>
<p>Marge, it's as plain as the bruise on my shin.</p>
<p>There's no place for me here.</p>
<p>Where you going, Reverend? The town's that way.</p>
<p>Reverend?</p>
<p>You're going the wrong way.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Ned.</p>
<p>It looks like God has packed up and left Springfield.</p>
<p>Ah, no. No, you're lying. You're lying.</p>
<p>What makes you lie?</p>
<p>[CRYING]</p>
<p>Good evening. Springfield is grappling tonight... with the departure of Rev. Timothy Lovejoy, Bible nut.</p>
<p>How is our community coping with this spiritual vacuum?</p>
<p>Let's ask Arnie Pie in the sky.</p>
<p>You wanna know what I see, Kent?</p>
<p>I see a slow news day with nothing to fill it.</p>
<p>You're supposed to be filming people coping with the loss of their church.</p>
<p>And how am I supposed to do that?</p>
<p>Do I have a magic lens that can see into people's souls?</p>
<p>Well, yours would be black, Kent. Black as the ace of spades.</p>
<p>[GROANS]</p>
<p>Homer, send these people home.</p>
<p>This house-warming party's been going on for two days.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, you can't throw us out.</p>
<p>I just made a Cornish game hen with chestnut stuffing.</p>
<p>Would you believe a pigeon stuffed with Spam?</p>
<p>A rat filled with cough drops?</p>
<p>[ALL CHATTERING]</p>
<p>They've broken every commandment except one.</p>
<p><strong>Carl</strong>: Hey, Lenny, covet some more chili fries?</p>
<p>That's it. The whole shebang.</p>
<p>Lord, this town may have turned its back on you, but not the Flanders'.</p>
<p>Wherever we are, you'll have your church.</p>
<p>Are you with me, boys?</p>
<p>[BOTH BABBLING]</p>
<p>Speaking in tongues, what great kids.</p>
<p>[BABBLING CONTINUES]</p>
<p>Full house. Jacks over twos.</p>
<p>Ha, ha, read them and strip, Barn.</p>
<p>[GROANS]</p>
<p>Uh-uh-uh-uh. Slowly. Make me forget my troubles.</p>
<p>Oh, I hate this game.</p>
<p>Look at all this. The great food, the party, the sunshine.</p>
<p>Pfft! Hard to believe one God came up with all this.</p>
<p>Well, there's probably a lot of gods.</p>
<p>Yeah, and some of them's gotta be chicks.</p>
<p>Yeah, with, like, a thousand boobs.</p>
<p>Woo-hoo! That's the God I'm gonna worship.</p>
<p>Well, there's only one God for me, your dad's old hunting trophy.</p>
<p>On Dasher, on Dancer. Man, I must be wasted.</p>
<p>[RUMBLING]</p>
<p>Homer, aren't you afraid you might be...?</p>
<p>I don't know, incurring God's wrath?</p>
<p>Eh. God's cool.</p>
<p>See, I don't know that he is.</p>
<p>In the Bible, he's always smiting and turning people into salt.</p>
<p>Oh, look. God's giving us a little shower.</p>
<p>Everybody, look at the much needed rain.</p>
<p>Thank you, God. Now, turn the rainwater into wine.</p>
<p>[ALL SCREAMING]</p>
<p>Okay, boys. This is it. The end of this sinful little suburb.</p>
<p>[IN UNISON] Yay!</p>
<p>Let every evil lung fill.</p>
<p><strong>Ned</strong>: Okay. I got two of every animal... but only males. I don't want any hanky-panky.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey. Cut that out.</p>
<p>Wet and wonderful God... your flood has driven us to the roof of your church.</p>
<p>Surely this has proven whatever point you had.</p>
<p>Oh, God's ignoring me.</p>
<p>Dad, maybe you should stop praying. See if that makes it happy.</p>
<p>This heretic has doomed us all.</p>
<p>Yeah. I say we skin him alive and set him on fire.</p>
<p>Yeah, that'll appease God.</p>
<p>Appease who now?</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Whoa, let's get biblical.</p>
<p><strong>Lovejoy</strong>: Leave that man alone.</p>
<p>It's Reverend Lovejoy.</p>
<p>Let us pray.</p>
<p>Dear Lord, please spare this sinful town.</p>
<p>They were misled by a demon in blue pants.</p>
<p>I guess I learned something here.</p>
<p>God is capable of great anger and great mercy... but mostly great anger.</p>
<p>There are perfectly logical explanations for everything that happened.</p>
<p>The bonfire sent soot into the air, which created rain.</p>
<p>And with all the trees cut down, a flood was inevitable.</p>
<p>Yeah. But what made the rain stop?</p>
<p>I don't know. Buddha?</p>
<p>Hey, they've suffered enough.</p>
<p>Keep that popcorn chicken coming, colonel.</p>
<p>Mm, mm.</p>
<p>Not bad.</p>
<p>I think it's about time for you to tell me what's in those spices.</p>
