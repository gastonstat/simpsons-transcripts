The Boys of Bummer</p>
<p>Homer, what took you so long?</p>
<p>The game's almost over.</p>
<p>I got hung up at the snack stand watching those hot dogs rolling and turning, not a care in the world.</p>
<p>No more lazy Saturdays for you.</p>
<p>Strike two!</p>
<p>By my calculations, we're only one strike away from victory.</p>
<p>Numbers are fun.</p>
<p>This is it, boys.</p>
<p>One more out and we go to the championship game.</p>
<p>Let's do it for Groundskeeper Willie, who made me this beautiful black bicep warmer!</p>
<p>It keeps me naughty hands busy.</p>
<p>I got it! I got it!</p>
<p>I hogged it! I hogged it!</p>
<p>My son caught the ball!</p>
<p>This makes up for everything that's gone wrong in my life or ever will!</p>
<p>I'm also pleased!</p>
<p>After years of failure in everything we've attempted, we are one victory away from a championship, people.</p>
<p>And our newfound glory is all due to these wonderful boys.</p>
<p>Behold my naked butt!</p>
<p>Each cheek is a god to you!</p>
<p>Now Bart, stay humble.</p>
<p>Your baseball cap won't fit over a swelled head.</p>
<p>Flanders, these boys have earned the right to behave like arrogant oafs.</p>
<p>Can we egg the crowd?</p>
<p>In this modern-day Deadwood you can do anything.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Smithers, I'm missing the fun!</p>
<p>Upsy-daisy, sir.</p>
<p>Ah, what glorious goo!</p>
<p>I need a dress to wear for my son's big game.</p>
<p>He's the star, I'm his mom, and he's my son.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm, you've mentioned his name and batting average several times.</p>
<p>Well, he's done very well for someone who came out blue and backwards.</p>
<p>Listen, do you mind if I hum while you talk?</p>
<p>Not at all!</p>
<p>He single-handedly got the team to the championship, first time ever.</p>
<p>My son caught the ball that won the game.</p>
<p>I hate shopping!</p>
<p>I'm bored; my feet hurt;</p>
<p>I'm too big for the choo-choo train.</p>
<p>Hmm... where's the &quot;husband chair&quot;?</p>
<p>Unless you're serving me a cold beer, you keep moving.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>There must be another chair.</p>
<p>Eh-eh.</p>
<p>My wife's lookin' for a bathing suit that doesn't make her look &quot;horsey.&quot;</p>
<p>So, I'm gonna be here a while.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>I guess I could just sit on a bed.</p>
<p>Wow, this is soft.</p>
<p>Sure feels weird lying on top of the covers.</p>
<p>Sure feels weird lying in bed with my pants on.</p>
<p>What in the name of...?</p>
<p>Hey, you!</p>
<p>Whoa! How many?</p>
<p>Are you sleeping in the middle of my department store?</p>
<p>Well... who wouldn't with an incredible mattress like this?</p>
<p>It works with my body's natural curves and supports my back-boobs.</p>
<p>That's the best endorsement I've heard since Mickey Mantle for Maypo!</p>
<p>I'll take five mattresses.</p>
<p>I don't work here.</p>
<p>You do now, son!</p>
<p>You're hired!</p>
<p>Woo-hoo!</p>
<p>All this fuss for a baseball game?</p>
<p>Why don't thousands come to watch a teacher inspire a child?</p>
<p>But it did happen.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, in Crazytown!</p>
<p>So, in the amber gloaming of this September afternoon, Shelbyville has the bases loaded, but the lsotots only need one out to win the championship and get that pizza party at Luigi's!</p>
<p>Luigi's, they deliver on flavor, but not to your house!</p>
<p>Damas y caballeros, if the lsotots win, please do not fire your g*n in the air.</p>
<p>The b*ll*ts will come down!</p>
<p>And k*ll my sister.</p>
<p>A lazy pop fly to star shortstop Bart Simpson.</p>
<p>And this should do it!</p>
<p>Now for the defining moment of my life.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Simpson drops the ball!</p>
<p>And he kicks it!</p>
<p>And he kicks it again! And again!</p>
<p>Oh, it's horrible, but you can't take your eyes away!</p>
<p>It's like watching a monkey swallow a hand grenade.</p>
<p>The lsotots lose the pennant!</p>
<p>The lsotots lose the pennant!</p>
<p>Bart, you choked!</p>
<p>I put on fresh makeup for this?</p>
<p>Knock it off!</p>
<p>He's just a kid!</p>
<p>Aw, hey that's the guy what created him!</p>
<p>If Homer had used some protection, we'd all be poopin' roses on easy street!</p>
<p>Hey, get off my case!</p>
<p>He's the choke artist!</p>
<p>Quick, Bart, Bart, get in!</p>
<p>Thanks, Chief.</p>
<p>Don't mention it, son.</p>
<p>He's back!</p>
<p>Go nuts, everyone!</p>
<p>Bart's coming down!</p>
<p>Hide the sports section!</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Good morning, sweetie.</p>
<p>There's nothing you can say.</p>
<p>After that game, my life is over.</p>
<p>Was there even a baseball game yesterday?</p>
<p>I don't remember...</p>
<p>Marge, we were just talking about it a few seconds ago.</p>
<p>Don't you have to get to your job as a mattress salesman?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Let's see where that goes.</p>
<p>Let me tell you about a land where it rains beer and hails pretzels and you can play swim-up blackjack with Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>It's the land of sleep.</p>
<p>And your passport : a simple mattress.</p>
<p>Yes, I need to be able to sleep through my wife's nagging and my eight horrible babies and the anguished howls of my ancestors.</p>
<p>A common problem.</p>
<p>Try this.</p>
<p>Oh. Ooh.</p>
<p>Oh, I feel like I'm floating on a river of corpses.</p>
<p>Homer, we have a friend-- actually a friend of a friend...</p>
<p>Sex problem, eh?!</p>
<p>Homer, please.</p>
<p>They can hear you in Fine China.</p>
<p>Relax. I'm a licensed mattress professional, if there were such a thing, and I've got the answer to your problems: The Snugulux by Matrimonium.</p>
<p>Ooh, sold.</p>
<p>And remember: your most intimate secrets are safe with me.</p>
<p>Okay, who else is dead in bed?</p>
<p>You're listening to KBBL, your official&quot;Bart Simpson sucks&quot; station.</p>
<p>Oh-ho, and here comes another &quot;Bash Bart Block,&quot; starting with this entry from Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney.</p>
<p>Bart stinks.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Bart stinks.</p>
<p>Bart stinks.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Bart stinks...</p>
<p>Oh, my favorite song ruined!</p>
<p>Bart, come with me.</p>
<p>I'll take you to someone who will make you feel better.</p>
<p>Is it my rabbit Cottontail?</p>
<p>The one who went to live upstate?</p>
<p>He died, Bart.</p>
<p>Dad buried him in the backyard.</p>
<p>But not in that order.</p>
<p>Bart, meet Joe LaBoot.</p>
<p>LaBoot, LaBoot.</p>
<p>Sounds familiar.</p>
<p>You probably remember me from 1943 World Series.</p>
<p>With the score tied in game seven, Tommy Heinrich of the Yankees hit a ball in my direction.</p>
<p>Jugglin' Joe LaBoot they called me.</p>
<p>When I finally picked up the ball, I threw it into the stands, hitting Eleanor Roosevelt, who up till then had been a great beauty.</p>
<p>We lost the game and the series.</p>
<p>But I bounced back.</p>
<p>Got my own car dealership.</p>
<p>I have 17 grandchildren and a big home in ldaho.</p>
<p>It's a great life!</p>
<p>Yeah, in ldaho.</p>
<p>And at these card shows, the fans let me know that I've put my gaffe behind me.</p>
<p>You stink, LaBoot!</p>
<p>No, I don't! Google my stats!</p>
<p>Take it from me, kid, you'll be just fine.</p>
<p>Feel better now, Bart?</p>

<p><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div></p>
<p>&quot;Bart?!&quot; Are you Bart Simpson?</p>
<p>The kid who dropped that easy fly ball?!</p>
<p>You stink like a Dutchman's throw-up.</p>
<p>Talking to you was the biggest error of my life!</p>
<p>Boo. Boo, indeed.</p>
<p>The Lovejoys?!</p>
<p>If this is about me drinking that holy water, let me tell you, I had had like a million Doritos.</p>
<p>You know, the ones with the flame on the bag?</p>
<p>Oh-ho, that bag ain't lyin'!</p>
<p>We're here about the mattress.</p>
<p>What's wrong with it?</p>
<p>We tried raising Cain, but we weren't able.</p>
<p>Oh, I think I know what you're doing wrong.</p>
<p>Have you tried...</p>
<p>I know the mechanics of lovemaking, Homer!</p>
<p>You owe us a refund!</p>
<p>I'll write you a check.</p>
<p>&quot;Pay to the order of Stupid Reverend.</p>
<p>Memo: Bite my ass.&quot;</p>
<p>Wha...?!</p>
<p>Homer, I'm not a man who believes in miracles, but this bed of yours could resurrect our sex life.</p>
<p>If you let us have your mattress, we'll give you ours.</p>
<p>On one condition: you do the shlepping.</p>
<p>Well, I'll have to check with my wife.</p>
<p>Move over just a...</p>
<p>Ow, well, maybe if you g..</p>
<p>No, wrong, wrong, wrong!</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Homie.</p>
<p>I want to snuggle, but I'm just not feeling it.</p>
<p>Yeah, something has changed, but I can't figure out what.</p>
<p>Our mattress!</p>
<p>I traded it to the Lovejoys!</p>
<p>You traded our mattress?</p>
<p>I had my secret cash in it.</p>
<p>Oh, that's long gone, baby.</p>
<p>Long gone.</p>
<p>It was made for Elvis, but he found it tacky.</p>
<p>But I can't believe a mattress could make that much difference.</p>
<p>This little light of mine.</p>
<p>I'm gonna let it shine Oh, glory.</p>
<p>This little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine.</p>
<p>Every day, every day.</p>
<p>Every day Yay, yay, yay!</p>
<p>Lousy Reverend, he's having my sex while I'm at home with Marge not doing anything sensual or erotic.</p>
<p>A damp sponge will take care of this weak, water-based...</p>
<p>It's oil-based!</p>
<p>Oil-based!</p>
<p>Daddy?</p>
<p>Fetch Daddy's thinner, boy.</p>
<p>But it's in the &quot;stay away&quot; closet.</p>
<p>You just fetch it!</p>
<p>Who would do this to Bart?</p>
<p>The person who hates Bart more than anyone else.</p>
<p>Look!</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, that's really something.</p>
<p>Mom, put your glasses on.</p>
<p>But they make me look dowdy.</p>
<p>My baby!</p>
<p>See? I hate me, too.</p>
<p>Now we can be friends again.</p>
<p>Bart, stop!</p>
<p>No one's mad at you anymore, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. You know.</p>
<p>Jump!</p>
<p>Who-Who said that?</p>
<p>I hate Bart Simpson!</p>
<p>I got him! I got him!</p>
<p>You stink, LaBoot!</p>
<p>Damn it!</p>
<p>He'll be all right.</p>
<p>Right now he just needs peace and quiet.</p>
<p>Bart sucks! Bart sucks!</p>
<p>Bart sucks! Bart sucks!</p>
<p>You should all be ashamed!</p>
<p>Passing judgment on a child for a sports boo-boo!</p>
<p>What have you people ever done?</p>
<p>Well, I wrote a best-selling series of mystery novels.</p>
<p>Stephen King called it, &quot;Scary, good fun.&quot;</p>
<p>Besides that.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to you, my special little guy will be haunted by this for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>I always thought that was just a slogan to attract small businesses.</p>
<p>But now I know it's the truth.</p>
<p>Okay, Midge.</p>
<p>You made us feel bad about what we done to your boy, but what can we do about it now?</p>
<p>It's not like we can play the game over again.</p>
<p>Can't we?</p>
<p>Like I just said, we can't.</p>
<p>Are you sure?</p>
<p>Open your freakin' ears.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>I think maybe we... Could.</p>
<p>And I say, I have difficulty Envisioning it.</p>
<p>Let me get this straight.</p>
<p>You want our boys to play a fake rematch against Springfield so your son can make the catch he missed and feel better about himself.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I guess I could, uh, if you pretend to be my fiancie when my mother comes to visit.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>If you pretend to be our chauffeur at my highschool reunion.</p>
<p>Fine, fine, if you pretend to be a ghost at an old amusement park I'm trying to buy.</p>
<p>We should stop now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You want me to reannounce a game I've already called?</p>
<p>Oh, sister, I got too much integrity.</p>
<p>The same integrity Farmer Dan puts into every link sausage.</p>
<p>Then I guess you wouldn't mind eating one.</p>
<p>Of course I wouldn't.</p>
<p>It's not like they're made of skunk tails and horse nipples.</p>
<p>I'll do whatever you say!</p>
<p>Just get that death wiener away from me!</p>
<p>I'm starting to feel funny about doing this.</p>
<p>Look, we're just going to take our mattress, do a quick sweep of the medicine chest, then we're out of here.</p>
<p>Homer, stop that.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>There it is. Old Bounce an' Giggle.</p>
<p>You put on the Michael Bolton CD. I'll put on my edible vestments.</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>How dare you breakin to our house, defile our bed, and smash our family photos with your foot.</p>
<p>Well, excuse me for being a powerful yet careless lover.</p>
<p>Reverend Lovejoy, our marriage needs this bed.</p>
<p>Our marriage needs it more!</p>
<p>Well, I am reminded of the story of wise King Solomon.</p>
<p>You would be.</p>
<p>I wish he hadn't cut it that way.</p>
<p>It looks like a grilled-cheese sandwich.</p>
<p>Or a chicken club.</p>
<p>Or a-a Reuben.</p>
<p>Or a Monte Cristo, or...</p>
<p>Pull over behind that billboard!</p>
<p>Oh! Oh, yeah!</p>
<p>You really want to make love on half a mattress behind a billboard?</p>
<p>It's like our honeymoon all over again.</p>
<p>We even have the same bum looking at us.</p>
<p>I knew you kids would make it.</p>
<p>Man, you got fat.</p>
<p>So, it's déja vu all over again as Springfield needs just one out to win the game and the championship.</p>
<p>Who'd have thunk it?</p>
<p>Probably everyone who was here the last time.</p>
<p>I still can't believe it.</p>
<p>They dusted the plate with a non-regulation brush, so we have to play the last inning over again.</p>
<p>I think this time it'll have a happier ending.</p>
<p>Why do you think that?</p>
<p>Uh... uh...</p>
<p>They warned me not to talk to you.</p>
<p>Who warned you?</p>
<p>Nobody!</p>
<p>Hello, redemption.</p>
<p>Bart gets another try!</p>
<p>Uh, the batter hit it by accident, not by design.</p>
<p>Play ball!</p>
<p>Er, uh, that is also a do-over cause, um, er, uh...</p>
<p>There's a naked idiot on the field.</p>
<p>Woo-hoo!</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Play ball.</p>
<p>I did it! I did it! I did it!</p>
<p>Oh. Yay. All right.</p>
<p>And the 78th time is the charm!</p>
<p>Now, over the left field wall, the real show's about to begin: the glorious sunrise, brought to you by God, the invisible giant you turn to when you're about to die.</p>
<p>Hey, Milhouse, did I ever tell you about the catch I made when I was ten?</p>
<p>Greatest moment of my life.</p>
<p>It was a fake, you idiot!</p>
<p>We did it to make you feel better.</p>
<p>A fake?</p>
<p>Then I did suck.</p>
<p>I-I... I do suck!</p>
<p>No, that was a fake just now.</p>
<p>You did make the catch.</p>
<p>I knew it! I rule!</p>
<p>And you drool!</p>
<p>Boy, our son can be a real jerk.</p>
<p>Hey, do you want to have ghost sex?</p>
<p>I keep telling you, ghost sex is nothing.</p>
<p>It's worse than nothing.</p>
<p>Then why were you moaning last time?</p>
<p>Because I'm a ghost!</p>
<p>A ghost!</p>
