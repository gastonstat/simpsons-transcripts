<p>Good sir, perchance<br />
you would like to try on  </p>
<p>the &quot;categorize cap&quot; to see which school  </p>
<p>of magic most suits thee?  </p>
<p>Not today, weirdo.  </p>
<p>(ALARM BLARES)   </p>
<p>Congratulations, you're a Grizzledum!   </p>
<p>Yes! Finally! A hat that respects me!   </p>
<p>Don't be too cocky.   </p>
<p>That means you're a sworn<br />
enemy of Pufflesnuff.   </p>
<p>I hate those guys.   </p>
<p>Well, well, well, if it ain't   </p>
<p>one of those Grizzledum gits.   </p>
<p>Someone had a little too much<br />
bubble and squeak for breakfast.   </p>
<p>Don't worry, Dad.<br />
Those are just park employees.   </p>
<p>Cool! Then they can't hit me back.   </p>
<p>Oi!   </p>
<p>We're seasonal workers.   </p>
<p>We can do as we bloody well please.   </p>
<p>Yeah, well, just wait'll my<br />
fellow Grizzledums help me.   </p>
<p>I'm known for my stomach aches.   </p>
<p>My character was cut from the movies.   </p>
<p>- Aah!<br />
- Get him!   </p>
<p>[SIGHS] This is a good<br />
time to call Grampa   </p>
<p>and see how Maggie's doing.   </p>
<p>PUFFLESNUFF:<br />
Carve a lightning bolt in his head!   </p>
<p><em>Hello, Mabel. Can I have my dad?</em>   </p>
<p>Sure thing, Marge.   </p>
<p>Patching you through to Throwback     .   </p>
<p>(PHONE RINGS)   </p>
<p>Hey, Marge, everything is A-okay,   </p>
<p>which was a popular slogan   </p>
<p>during Martin Van Buren's<br />
election campaign because...   </p>
<p>Ooh, thank God<br />
I'm on my anti-rambling meds.   </p>
<p>I remember the first day I went on them.   </p>
<p>That's it. Anyway, Maggie's having fun   </p>
<p>with her little friend.   </p>
<p>We're at the beach?!   </p>
<p>I better put on sunscreen.   </p>
<p>(HUMMING)   </p>
<p>♪ ♪   </p>
<p>(EXHALES) I finally know what it's like   </p>
<p>to be a British beverage.   </p>
<p>Gently back and forth, back and forth.   </p>
<p>Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!   </p>
<p>Bart! Stop playing with the wheel.   </p>
<p>Only if Homer buys us<br />
something at the gift shop!   </p>
<p>Why do I keep thinking<br />
these places will be fun?   </p>
<p>You don't!<br />
It's a place you can be with us   </p>
<p>without having to talk to us.   </p>
<p>- (BART LAUGHS EVILLY)</p>
<p>Oh, finally, a place to spend money.   </p>
<p>I'll take three of each wand   </p>
<p>plus holsters and the<br />
five-year magic care warranty.   </p>
<p>And I'll pick the one<br />
that costs a little extra   </p>
<p>because they also give<br />
a wand to a needy child.   </p>
<p>(GROANS)   </p>
<p>(GRUNTING)   </p>
<p>Aw.   </p>
<p>Listen to her, purring like a kitten.   </p>
<p>(GASPS) Grampa,<br />
when was the last time you saw Maggie?   </p>
<p>I just changed her diaper   </p>
<p>before I put the cat out.   </p>
<p>Uh-oh.   </p>
<p>- Maggie!<br />
- Where are you, Mags?   </p>
<p>Ask Grampa, maybe he knows.   </p>
<p>(KNOCKING)   </p>
<p>Simpsons, I don't know   </p>
<p>if Heaven's missing an angel,<br />
but I think you might be.   </p>
<p>Oh, my sweet baby!   </p>
<p>Flanders, I owe ya one.   </p>
<p>Well, sir, could you<br />
give me back my Allen wrench?   </p>
<p>(SCOFFS) This guy names his tools.   </p>
<p>Grampa, I'm afraid we'll never<br />
ask you to babysit again.   </p>
<p>Who says I want to?<br />
You never even pay me!   </p>
<p>Well, you can rest easy<br />
knowing if anything did happen,   </p>
<p>she has the only<br />
insurance you truly need.   </p>
<p>A simple Christian baptism.   </p>
<p>Actually, we haven't gotten around   </p>
<p>to baptizing her yet.   </p>
<p>You mean this child could've been   </p>
<p>cast into God's basement   </p>
<p>of eternal burning,<br />
because you were &quot;too busy&quot;?   </p>
<p>We could baptize her soon,<br />
if you want to be the godfather.   </p>
<p>Oh, no can-doodily.<br />
I'm already the godfather   </p>
<p>to  ,    children. Take one of these.   </p>
<p>- It'll buzz when I have an opening.<br />
- (BUZZES)   </p>
<p>This is for a baptism?   </p>
<p>My wife is Shinto and I worship<br />
the Klingon faith of Ba-a-a-a.   </p>
<p>We thought this was for Tony Roma's.   </p>
<p>Good night!   </p>
<p>I can't stop thinking about<br />
Maggie not being baptized.   </p>
<p>What if... the unspeakable happens?   </p>
<p>Are you saying that just<br />
because we don't splash   </p>
<p>a little water on her<br />
she's gonna burn forever?    </p>
<p>Sleep well,<br />
knowing current religious thought    </p>
<p>is Maggie won't go to Hell.    </p>
<p>Although that's always up for debate.    </p>
<p>- Mm. (SNORES)<br />
- (SIGHS)    </p>
<p>Hmm.    </p>
<p>♪ ♪    </p>
<p>Ah! Ah.    </p>
<p>Nice and unbaptized.    </p>
<p>She'll play in an unsanitary ball pit    </p>
<p>- for all eternity.<br />
- (GASPS)    </p>
<p>- (DEVIL LAUGHING)</p>
<p>And I'm here, too!    </p>
<p>And I've got Milhouse<br />
growing on my back.    </p>
<p>I'm the front and you're the back!    </p>
<p>- I'm the front!<br />
- (GRUNTS)    </p>
<p>Ow!    </p>
<p>We have to get Maggie baptized now.    </p>
<p>Either Patty or Selma<br />
could be the godmother.    </p>
<p>Well, that would insult one of them.    </p>
<p>But I want to insult both of them.    </p>
<p>What we really need    </p>
<p>for the godfather    </p>
<p>is someone who goes to church weekly,    </p>
<p>not the Christmas and Easter crowd.    </p>
<p>Lousy part-time Protestants.    </p>
<p>I go every week and sleep through mass    </p>
<p>like a real Christian.    </p>
<p>Homie, this is important to me.    </p>
<p>I get it, but can't this wait?    </p>
<p>You go find her a godfather!    </p>
<p>The classiest person you know.    </p>
<p>- BOTH: Hey!<br />
- Wait a minute!    </p>
<p>I wasn't watching that!    </p>
<p>Guys, this is serious.    </p>
<p>I'm looking for a godfather<br />
for my little angel.    </p>
<p>Aw, what a cutie.<br />
Let me give her a sip of beer.    </p>
<p>Okay, you're out.    </p>
<p>If I'm out, Carl's out.    </p>
<p>I decide who tells me what to do. Moe?    </p>
<p>You're out, Carl.<br />
So, Homer, I hear you're lookin' for...    </p>
<p>You're out. Barney?    </p>
<p>- You're out.<br />
- Aw!    </p>
<p>Godfather? Well let's see.    </p>
<p>I have done a great job with Ralphie.    </p>
<p>HOMER: Wiggum out.    </p>
<p>Don't worry, sweetie.<br />
You don't need a godfather right away.    </p>
<p>You're gonna live a long, long time.    </p>
<p>Here's another avoidable<br />
death you've gotten us into.    </p>
<p>(SOBBING)    </p>
<p>Fat Tony!    </p>
<p>You saved us!    </p>
<p>Not I. It was the Blessed Mother.    </p>
<p>You're religious, too.    </p>
<p>You'd be a great godfather,<br />
if it weren't for...    </p>
<p>If it weren't for what?    </p>
<p>Uh... you know...    </p>
<p>No, I do not know.    </p>
<p>(WHIMPERS)    </p>
<p>What a cute little bambina.    </p>
<p>(MAGGIE GIGGLING)    </p>
<p>I accept your offer.    </p>
<p>I will be godfather to your child.    </p>
<p>Yeah, but, but, but...    </p>
<p>You did offer it to me, didn't you?    </p>
<p>He said it. We got it all on tape.    </p>
<p>(SOBS) I truly appreciate this.    </p>
<p>I have nothing innocent<br />
and pure in my life,    </p>
<p>but now I have this sweet little angel.    </p>
<p>Great, great. This'll be<br />
just like<em> The Godfather.</em>    </p>
<p>- The what?<br />
- You know, the movie <em>The Godfather.</em>    </p>
<p>- Never heard of it.<br />
- It's about a guy like you,    </p>
<p>- who does what you do.<br />
- Which is what?    </p>
<p>Um, legitimate business.    </p>
<p>He sounds like quite the fellow,<br />
this godfather.    </p>
<p>I've seen<em> Shark Tale</em> and<em> Analyze This,</em>    </p>
<p>but that sounds even better.    </p>
<p>Fat Tony can't be godfather.    </p>
<p>We'd be better off with Mr. Burns.    </p>
<p>I asked him.<br />
He's allergic to new baby smell.    </p>
<p>(KNOCKING)    </p>
<p>Pardon me for dropping by unannounced,    </p>
<p>but I could not help but notice<br />
that my goddaughter-to-be has    </p>
<p>an outdated car seat facing<br />
in the wrong direction.    </p>
<p>(WHIMPERS)    </p>
<p>So, I have taken the<br />
liberty of purchasing you    </p>
<p>the most exclusive, top-of-the-line    </p>
<p>car seat: the Ferrari Protect-a-rossa.    </p>
<p>Well, that's very nice, but...    </p>
<p>And you, the mama,<br />
will drive her more safely    </p>
<p>in this Luxus SUV I have<br />
leased in your name.    </p>
<p>It's got everything.    </p>
<p>Blindspot monitors...    </p>
<p>built-in humidor, a GPS    </p>
<p>that doesn't think it's better than you.    </p>
<p>MALE VOICE: Sure, let's try it your way.    </p>
<p>- Oh...<br />
- FAT TONY: Hmm?    </p>
<p>Fat Tony, I'm sorry,<br />
but you can't be the godfather.    </p>
<p>Marge, think about this.    </p>
<p>Your baby will want to<br />
go to an elite preschool,    </p>
<p>a prestigious prep school,    </p>
<p>a college with the ivy.    </p>
<p>I could help you with all these things.    </p>
<p>You can really do that?    </p>
<p>With the soccer coaches<br />
and admissions officers    </p>
<p>I have in my pocket like<br />
so many yogurt melties.    </p>
<p>We'll play along until<br />
we can get out of it.    </p>
<p>Godfather.    </p>
<p>Welcome to the family.    </p>
<p>Welcome to the family.    </p>
<p><em>MARGE: Okay, just get through this.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Then you never see the godparents again.</em>    </p>
<p>Always so nice to see you, Fat Tony.    </p>
<p>Is everything okay?    </p>
<p>Please, please, say it's okay.    </p>
<p>Why you no answering?    </p>
<p>I'm a-gonna die!<br />
And I've never been-a to Italy!    </p>
<p>(SOBBING)    </p>
<p>Everything's fine.    </p>
<p>Ah, I knew it. Have-a some parmesan.    </p>
<p>My hand! It's-a having a heart attack!    </p>
<p>Now, I take my duties<br />
as godfather seriously.    </p>
<p>I might almost be intrusive.    </p>
<p>Almost.    </p>
<p>First, I want to help    </p>
<p>with little Margaret's<br />
religious development.    </p>
<p>For my first communion,<br />
my sainted mother gave me    </p>
<p>this book and ten dollars,<br />
which was a fortune to me.    </p>
<p>I never spent it.    </p>
<p>Mama!    </p>
<p>First, the queen of all saints,    </p>
<p>Mary, the only woman in history    </p>
<p>who had the ugatz to be<br />
a mother and a virgin.    </p>
<p>Actually,<br />
the virgin birth is the doctrine    </p>
<p>of traditional Christianity.    </p>
<p>Not Protestants.    </p>
<p><em>La b*at madre è stata</em>    </p>
<p><em>concepita senza peccato originale.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Quindi è possibile che<br />
sia madre e vergine.</em>    </p>
<p>Oh. Got it.    </p>
<p>This is Saint Lucia,    </p>
<p>which may or may not<br />
be where my money is.    </p>
<p>And this is St. Zeno of Verona,    </p>
<p>the saint of learning to speak.    </p>
<p>For you, Margaret.    </p>
<p>Hmm.    </p>
<p>Ah, you got to love<br />
a religion with merch.    </p>
<p>Maybe this could work out.    </p>
<p>You just enjoy riding<br />
in a safe car for once.    </p>
<p>Yes! Yes! Yes, I do!    </p>
<p>For the family.    </p>
<p>Stop so we can do the door again.    </p>
<p>Whoa, Mama! (LAUGHS)    </p>
<p>D'oh!    </p>
<p>I can't believe the<br />
boss has us babysitting.    </p>
<p>I broke out of prison for this?    </p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa!    </p>
<p>Careful, those babies got<br />
those super sharp fingernails!    </p>
<p>Here ya go, Baby Boss.    </p>
<p><em>Mangia. Mangia.</em>    </p>
<p>Leave no evidence.    </p>
<p>Boss, Benny down at the liquor store    </p>
<p>is late on his payment. Again.    </p>
<p>Let me break his kneecaps.    </p>
<p><em>Marone a mi!</em>    </p>
<p>You never ever talk that<br />
way in front of a baby.    </p>
<p>Uh, uh, okay, uh,    </p>
<p>what if we give him a<br />
boo-boo to the brain?    </p>
<p>Make him go night-night forever?    </p>
<p>Disgusting!    </p>
<p>You give the kiss of<br />
death with that mouth?    </p>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me...    </p>
<p>I have to take sweet little Maggie    </p>
<p>to Guido and Me class.    </p>
<p>(HUMMING HAPPILY)    </p>
<p>I think the boss is gettin' soft.    </p>
<p>Next thing you know, he'll be startin'    </p>
<p>a<em> legitimate</em> legitimate business!    </p>
<p>Eh, I think you're imagining things.    </p>
<p>♪ <em>Twinkle, twinkle, little star</em> ♪    </p>
<p>♪ <em>Let me hotwire you a car</em> ♪    </p>
<p>♪ <em>We'll change the plates,<br />
I know a guy</em> ♪    </p>
<p>♪ <em>You'll be my little alibi.</em> ♪    </p>
<p>(LAUGHS) You stole my heart.    </p>
<p>You little criminal.    </p>
<p>(ALL GROANING)    </p>
<p>(ALL GASPING)    </p>
<p>Ah, it's-a so sad.    </p>
<p>Fat Tony has been a very good boss.    </p>
<p>I have too much respect<br />
for him not to k*ll him.    </p>
<p>Eh, what do you think, Johnny Tightlips?    </p>
<p>I don't want to do nothin' to nobody.    </p>
<p>So... you want to do<br />
somethin' to somebody.    </p>
<p>Exactly.    </p>
<p>Does Maggie seem different to you?    </p>
<p>I'm worried.    </p>

<p>Uh, Marge, let me put it this way.    </p>
<p>We can't be bad parents,    </p>
<p>because bad parents<br />
can't get their kid into...    </p>
<p>the finest preschool in town!    </p>
<p>Maggie has been admitted    </p>
<p>to the Preschool for<br />
the Performing Arts?    </p>
<p>They have a three-year wait.    </p>
<p>Is she in the morning<br />
class or afternoon?    </p>
<p>Morning.    </p>
<p>- Mm.<br />
- (KNOCKING)    </p>
<p>I'm afraid we have an agreement    </p>
<p>and you have not held up your end.    </p>
<p>We are going for a ride.    </p>
<p>(WHIMPERING)    </p>
<p>No!    </p>
<p>No goddaughter of mine<br />
will miss Sunday service.    </p>
<p>Oh, but I'm hungover.    </p>
<p>We were gonna go at  :   p.m.    </p>
<p>I'm afraid there ain't<br />
no  :   p.m. no more.    </p>
<p>Low attendance whacked<br />
it from the schedule.    </p>
<p>I knew it.    </p>
<p>You make a deal with the devil,    </p>
<p>and look where you wind up.    </p>
<p>- (SNORING)<br />
- Wake up.    </p>
<p>(BLABBERING)    </p>
<p>Oh, come on, man.    </p>
<p>Even the priest is asleep.    </p>
<p>(YAWNS)    </p>
<p>Please rise and open your hymnals.    </p>

<p>Look, if we're direct and<br />
say he can't be godfather,    </p>
<p>what's the worst that can happen?    </p>
<p>Did you see<em> The Godfather?</em>    </p>
<p>I saw the wedding part.    </p>
<p>Does anything happen after that?    </p>
<p>That Carlo seems like<br />
a wonderful husband.    </p>
<p>- What are you talking about?<br />
- Uh, Mister Fat?    </p>
<p>There's a non-whacking matter<br />
I need to discuss with you.    </p>
<p>I also have to tell you something.    </p>
<p>Your daughter is cute, smart,<br />
and sweet as a hung jury.    </p>
<p>So I will honor all of you next Sunday    </p>
<p>with tickets to Itchy and<br />
Scratchy's Christmas On Ice.    </p>
<p>Now, what did you want to tell me?    </p>
<p>I, um, uh, stall, stall...    </p>
<p>play for time... (STAMMERS)    </p>
<p>I wanted to tell you how<br />
great you look in that suit.    </p>
<p>Why, thank you.    </p>
<p>Why do people have such difficulty    </p>
<p>telling me how great I am?    </p>
<p>This is the first business I've had    </p>
<p>where in the back room<br />
is just more of the same.    </p>
<p>- Thoughts?<br />
- Hey, these diaper bags are great.    </p>
<p>You could hide a brick<br />
of nose candy in here.    </p>
<p>No, you<em> mezzo arguto paisan!</em>    </p>
<p>This is all aboveboard.    </p>
<p>I want to be family friendly.    </p>
<p>You mean &quot;the family&quot; family?    </p>
<p>I mean every family!    </p>
<p>Except the Branzinos.    </p>
<p>Death to them.    </p>
<p>ALL THREE: Death to them.    </p>
<p>Hey, boss, maybe you can get    </p>
<p>your little Maggie one of these.    </p>
<p>You would body shame a baby?!    </p>
<p>- (DOOR CLOSES)<br />
- I've seen enough.    </p>
<p>This Sunday we make our move.    </p>
<p>Can we make it Saturday? I got a thing.    </p>
<p>- Move your thing.<br />
- I already moved it    </p>
<p>for the thing that was<br />
cancelled for the you know what    </p>
<p>where we did that thing we did not do.    </p>
<p>That didn't happen two weeks ago.    </p>
<p>You don't know about that!    </p>
<p>You don't know what I don't know.    </p>
<p>Um, we certainly appreciate    </p>
<p>all you've done for us.    </p>
<p>Maggie has all the bling<br />
a toddler could want.    </p>
<p>Don't look at me.    </p>
<p>They fell off the back of a tricycle.    </p>
<p>(CRYING)    </p>
<p>(GASPS) What have we done?    </p>
<p>Uh, Maggie! What are ya doin'?    </p>
<p>I didn't mean it! Maggie!    </p>
<p>Fat Tony, get away from my kid!    </p>
<p>That's it.    </p>
<p>Fine. I see.    </p>
<p>Excuse me, there is an urgent matter    </p>
<p>I must attend to.    </p>
<p>(BURPS)    </p>
<p>Homer, can I tell you a little secret?    </p>
<p>- No, no, please don't!<br />
- It's a good secret.    </p>
<p>I'm finally getting out of<br />
this terrible business I'm in.    </p>
<p>And into the slightly<br />
less cutthroat business    </p>
<p>of maternity wear.    </p>
<p>I'm gonna get my soul back.    </p>
<p>And Maggie is my inspiration.    </p>
<p>- Aw.<br />
- Give me one more day    </p>
<p>to prove that I belong in her life.    </p>
<p>I'll see what I can do.    </p>
<p>(GIGGLES)    </p>
<p>Legs! Louie! Get in here!    </p>
<p>Dispose of this.    </p>
<p>I don't want to know where or how.    </p>
<p>Ain't nobody gonna find this now.    </p>
<p>Uh,<em> marone.</em> You never forget that smell.    </p>
<p>Remember: take the g*n.    </p>
<p>Leave the Zamboni.    </p>
<p>Okay, this is it. I'm ending it today.    </p>
<p>In a public place with<br />
a lot of witnesses.    </p>
<p>Well, Fat Tony, this is really fun,    </p>
<p>but where is everyone else?    </p>
<p>On the suggestion of my coworkers,    </p>
<p>who only have my best interests in mind,    </p>
<p>I bought out the whole arena    </p>
<p>for my dear little Maggie.    </p>
<p>No audience means no witnesses!    </p>
<p>What's going on?    </p>
<p>Fat Tony, I beg you!    </p>
<p>Stop being my daughter's godfather!    </p>
<p>If you do, I'll clean for you,<br />
I'll cook for you.    </p>
<p>I'll be your mama!    </p>
<p>God rest her soul.    </p>
<p>I must refuse your offer.    </p>
<p>I made a promise to<br />
God to watch your baby.    </p>
<p>And he's the only boss I answer to.    </p>
<p>Except that guy in Kansas City.    </p>
<p><em>MARGE: Oh, no! No!</em>    </p>
<p><em>We're stuck with him forever!</em>    </p>
<p><em>Maggie's in Hell already!</em>    </p>
<p>Johnny Tightlips!    </p>
<p>This is it, Tony.    </p>
<p>You did the worst thing<br />
a mob boss could ever do.    </p>
<p>Care about somebody else.    </p>
<p>I thought you was with<br />
me on this double cross!    </p>
<p>We'll never turn on Tony!<br />
He's my cousin!    </p>
<p>I thought he was my cousin!    </p>
<p>Well, he's somebody's cousin.    </p>
<p>And in this world, that's what counts.    </p>
<p>You would betray me?    </p>
<p>(GRUNTS)    </p>
<p>(GASPS)    </p>
<p>No, Maggie, no! I'm sorry!    </p>
<p>- That's not me!<br />
- Oh, isn't it?    </p>
<p>Oh, my God, you're right.    </p>
<p>I cannot change who I am.    </p>
<p>Also that maternity store was a joke.    </p>
<p>They look, but don't buy.    </p>
<p>But, Maggie, it's not too late<br />
for you to go straight.    </p>
<p>I'm stepping back as godfather.    </p>
<p>- Finally.<br />
- Thank God.    </p>
<p>(GRUNTING)    </p>
<p>Oops.    </p>
<p>Here's the keys to the SUV.    </p>
<p>(BOTH GRUNTING)    </p>
<p>You have to let go for<br />
me to take them back.    </p>
<p>I know, let me just    </p>
<p>open the doors one more time.    </p>
<p>(ALARM CHIRPS)    </p>
<p>(GRUNTS, GROANS)    </p>
<p>Maggie, my darling.    </p>
<p>Thank you for reminding me of everything    </p>
<p>that's good and sweet in this world.    </p>
<p>And now,<em> ciao bella.</em>    </p>
<p>(SNIFFING) Ew, uh,    </p>
<p>before you go... could you?    </p>
<p>Just when I thought I was out,    </p>
<p>they drag me back in.    </p>
<p>I'm not afraid to say it.    </p>
<p>If this keeps up, I'm calling HR.    </p>
<p>You mean Harry the Rat?<br />
He's buried right over there.    </p>
<p>Shh!</p>
