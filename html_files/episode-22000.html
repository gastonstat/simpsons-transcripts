<p>D'oh!</p>
<p><em>Oh, my God! The Mad magazine special edition.</em></p>
<p>They only put out 17 of these a year!</p>
<p>Boy, they're really sockin' it to that Spiro Agnew guy again. He must work there or something.</p>
<p><em>Let's do the fold-in.</p>
<p>Okay.</em></p>
<p>&quot;What higher power do TV evangelists worship?&quot;</p>
<p>I'll say God.</p>
<p>I'll say Jesus.</p>
<p><em>&quot;The almighty dollar&quot;?</p>
<p>You fold it, you bought it.</em></p>
<p>Whoo! &quot;Snappy answers to stupid questions.&quot;</p>
<p>I'm great at these. Ask me if something smells funny in here, boy.</p>
<p>Does something smell funny in here?</p>
<p>I don't think so, stupid.</p>
<p>Homie, you want pork chops?</p>
<p>No, I want roast beef, you clod!</p>
<p>Look at this. Special insert: &quot;Iron-on madness.</p>
<p>Ban the bath. Don't trust anyone over 10.</p>
<p>Sock it to me!&quot;</p>
<p>Those magazines create a dangerous amount of laughter.</p>
<p>&quot;The 'all-ighty ollar&quot;'?</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>Say, business stinks tonight. Where's Barney, Lenny and Carl?</p>
<p>They never come around anymore now that they got their mistresses.</p>
<p>Might as well close the dump.</p>
<p>I am gonna drink you under the table.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I am going to drink you under the-</p>
<p>Well, you're closin'. It's gettin' late.</p>
<p>My kids are probably wondering where their daddy is.</p>
<p>There's gotta be some other place we can go. Think, Moe! Think!</p>
<p>Sorry. It's league night. I couldn't give a lane to my own mother.</p>
<p>I have no son.</p>
<p>Man, you go through life, you try to be nice to people... you struggle to resist the urge to punch 'em in the face, and for what?</p>
<p>For some pimply little puke that treats ya like dirt unless you're on a team.</p>
<p>Well, I'm better than dirt. Well, most kinds of dirt.</p>
<p>I mean, not that fancy, store-bought dirt. That stuff's loaded with nutrients.</p>
<p>I can't compete with that stuff.</p>
<p>That I cannot bowl wreaks havoc with my self-esteem as well, but who am I to complain?</p>
<p>Well, I'm tired of being a wannabe league bowler. I wanna be a league bowler!</p>
<p>Hey, we can be a team.</p>
<p><em>Excuse me, but my team is ready to bowl.</em></p>
<p>You're short one person.</p>
<p>Uh... that long-haired freak's bowled with us for years.</p>
<p>I don't care if it takes me all night. I'm gonna get me that lobster harmonica.</p>
<p><em>Come on, lobstie. Whoo.</em></p>
<p>Oh, okay. Then I just need your $500 registration fee.</p>
<p>$500!</p>
<p>Oh, no problem. Would you take an out-of-state, two-party, bad check?</p>
<p>No, I will not pay you $500 for sex.</p>
<p>Aw, come on, Marge. You're getting something in return, and I'm getting a bowling team.</p>
<p>It's win-win.</p>
<p>It's sick... and I don't have that kind of money to spend on sex.</p>
<p>Maybe you could get someone with money to sponsor your team, like Mr. Burns.</p>
<p>Burns never gives money to anybody.</p>
<p>Just last week, I asked him for $1,500.</p>
<p>For what?</p>
<p>Oh, I gotta get the third degree from you too?</p>
<p>Tonight's homework assignment is-</p>
<p>Oh, man, is it hot in here.</p>
<p>I'd better take off my sweater.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Down with&quot;- &quot;homework&quot;?</em></p>
<p>Don't look at it, children.</p>
<p>His shirt makes a good point.</p>
<p>I'm with the shirt! Homework rots!</p>
<p>Down with homework! Down with homework!</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>As I was saying, my yearly evaluation couldn't have come at a better time.</p>
<p>Well, Seymour, I must say, for once, I am impressed.</p>
<p>In fact, I am going to give this school a perfect 10.</p>
<p>I'll just write the zero first.</p>
<p>Now a vertical line to indicate the one.</p>
<p>Down with homework!</p>
<p>Skinner, why are there children walking on my head?</p>
<p><em>So, we meet again, Mad magazine.</p>
<p>How do you know it's from Mad?</p>
<p>The year was 1968.</em></p>
<p>We were on recon in a steaming Mekong delta.</p>
<p>An overheated private removed his flak jacket, revealing a T-shirt...</p>
<p><em>with an iron-on sporting the Mad slogan &quot;up with miniskirts. &quot;</em></p>
<p>Well, we all had a good laugh, even though I didn't quite understand it.</p>
<p>But our momentary lapse of concentration allowed Charlie to get the drop on us.</p>
<p>I spent the next three years in a P.O.W. camp... forced to subsist on a thin stew made of fish, vegetables... prawns, coconut milk and four kinds of rice.</p>
<p>I came close to madness trying to find it here in the States... but they just can't get the spices right.</p>
<p>Uh, my punishment?</p>
<p>Hmm? Oh, I'm gonna have to think about that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, wear this home.</p>
<p>No-o-o. I need some more ether.</p>
<p>I can still feel the movement of the emery board.</p>
<p>We're fresh out, sir. I'll get some more.</p>
<p>Leave the rag.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Uh, excuse me, Mr. Burns.</p>
<p>Pop 'n' Fresh, you glutinous little dough boy!</p>
<p>There's something I've wanted to do to you for years.</p>
<p>Ow.</p>
<p>Mr. Burns, I was wondering if you'd like... to sponsor my bowling team for $500.</p>
<p>Why, certainly, Pop 'n' Fresh.</p>
<p>I owe my robust physique to your tubes of triple-bleached goo.</p>
<p>Whoo-hoo! Hey, everybody, if you wanna ask Burns for a favor, now's the time!</p>
<p>He's doped up or dyin' or somethin'!</p>
<p>Uh, excuse me. I'd like to request $17... for a push broom rebristling.</p>
<p>Why, it's that delightful TV leprechaun! I'm going to get your Lucky Charms.</p>
<p><em>Oh, no. My brains.</em></p>
<p>Hey, nice, quote, uniforms, end quote.</p>
<p>This just in. A new addition to our worst-dressed list: those guys!</p>
<p>Oh, forget this. I am far too fragile... to withstand an evening of barbs like that.</p>
<p>Oh, come on. If we quit now, we'll never know how badly they're gonna b*at us.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're right. That's the kind of thing that would haunt ya.</p>
<p><em>Hey!</p>
<p>Sí.</p>
<p>: Buenas noches, senoritas.!</em></p>
<p>What did he say? What did he say? Was that about me?</p>
<p>Okay, Otto. Pressure's on.</p>
<p>Don't choke. Don't choke. Don't choke. Don't... choke.</p>
<p>Oh, man! I knew I was gonna choke.</p>
<p><em>That's a funny-lookin' strike.</p>
<p>Come on, guys.</em></p>
<p>Let's be the team that supports each other.</p>
<p>You can do it, Otto! You can do it, Otto!</p>
<p>Help each other out! That'll be our motto!</p>
<p>You can do it, Otto! You can do it, Otto!</p>
<p>Make this spare, I give you free gelato!</p>
<p>Then back to my place, where I will get you blotto!</p>
<p><em>Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto.</p>
<p>You can do it, Otto! You can do it-</em></p>
<p>Guys, I made the spare. We won.</p>
<p>Yes! Yeah! All right!</p>
<p>Those beers are five dollars apiece.</p>
<p>Let me set the scene for you, Marge.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>It's a 7-10 split, the hardest sh*t in bowling.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>It was all up to me, so I got up all my courage.</p>
<p>Right away, my lips started to move... and I came up with a chant that won the match!</p>
<p>Who knocked down the pins?</p>
<p>I don't know. You know, some guy. Otto, I guess.</p>
<p>Good for him.</p>
<p>Yes, but, Marge, you're missing the point.</p>
<p>The individual doesn't matter. It was a team effort.</p>
<p>And I was the one who came up with the whole team idea.</p>
<p>Me.</p>
<p>I can't believe Otto picked up a 7-10 split.</p>
<p>He's phenomenal. Wow.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>Several days ago, a violent riot erupted... incited by an inflammatory T-shirt slogan.</p>
<p>No, no. Now, don't try to remember what that slogan was.</p>
<p>To ensure that this frenzied dance of destruction is never repeated...</p>
<p>I've decided, starting Monday, all students will be required to wear uniforms.</p>
<p>Huh? Uniforms?</p>
<p>Say hello to our little genius, Martin, who looks even smarter...</p>
<p><em>in this vest and short pant combination from Mr. Boy of Main Street.</p>
<p>Or how about little Lisa Simpson?</p>
<p>She'll have no reason to play the blues in this snappy ensemble... topped off with a saucy French beret... that seems to scream &quot;silence. &quot;</em></p>
<p>All right. Pick your size: extra small or extra large.</p>
<p>We've got both. No pushing now. I-What?</p>
<p>Oh, I've just been informed we've run out of extra large.</p>
<p><em>Go, Moe.! Go, Moe.! Don't make Homer shout out, &quot;D'oh.!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p><em>Yea!</em></p>
<p>All right, Snake. Make us proud.</p>
<p>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.</p>
<p>Bye!</p>
<p>Ah, we forfeit.</p>
<p><em>We'll take it.</em></p>
<p>There it is, boys: the championship trophy.</p>
<p>Whoo. We will never possess it.</p>
<p>The Holy Rollers have won it five years in a row.</p>
<p><em>They think they're so high and mighty...</em> just 'cause they never got caught drivin' without pants.</p>
<p>God boy couldn't get a strike!</p>
<p>It's me. Ned.</p>
<p>Mom, my slingshot doesn't fit in these pockets... and these shorts leave nothing to the imagination.</p>
<p>These uniforms suck.</p>
<p>Bart, where do you pick up words like that?</p>
<p><em>Yeah, Moe, that team sure did suck last night. Theyjust plain sucked.</em></p>
<p>I've seen teams suck before, but they were the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked.</p>
<p>Homer, watch your mouth!</p>
<p>I gotta go. My damn wiener kids are listening.</p>
<p>We are not wieners.</p>
<p>Then what are you dressed like that for?</p>
<p>They made us.</p>
<p>Oh. &quot;They made us.&quot;</p>
<p>That's loser talk. You gotta start acting more like me and my team... the future league champions of the world.</p>
<p>Nothing's gonna stop us now.</p>
<p>Stop everything! I don't remember writing a check for bowling.</p>
<p>Sir, that's a check for your boweling.</p>
<p>Oh, yes. That's very important.</p>
<p>Yes, sir. Remember that month you didn't do it?</p>
<p>Yes, that was unpleasant for all concerned.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the checks. Stop everything!</p>
<p>I don't remember writing a check for bowling.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>The memo says, &quot;To my pal, Pop 'n' Fresh.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, yes. That greedy, grasping glob of chemicals.</p>
<p>Probably one of your ether-induced hallucinations, sir.</p>
<p>I'll check the employee files to see who could pull off such an impersonation.</p>
<p>It was either Pops Freshenmeyer...</p>
<p><em>or Homer Simpson.</em></p>
<p>Simpson, eh? Let's shut down this bowling scam right now.</p>
<p><em>Come on, Homer. Come on, Homer. Pretend this is baseball and hit us a homer.</em></p>
<p>You rolled it. You rolled it.</p>
<p>By the way, rhyming &quot;Homer&quot; with &quot;Homer&quot;-</p>
<p>Look at them, Smithers, enjoying their embezzlement.</p>
<p>I have a much uglier word for it, sir: misappropriation.</p>
<p><em>Simpson.!</p>
<p>Listen here. I want to join your team.</em></p>
<p>You wanna join my what?</p>
<p>You wanna what his team?</p>
<p>I've had one of my unpredictable changes of heart.</p>
<p>Seeing these fine young athletes reveling in the humiliation of a vanquished foe-</p>
<p>I haven't felt this energized since my last... boweling.</p>
<p>Oh, man. He'll blow our winning streak.</p>
<p>Yeah. Call this an unfair generalization if you must... but old people are no good at everything.</p>
<p>Look, guys, it's not that simple. He's my boss.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what. I'll give him a sh*t, and if he stinks... it'll be easier to tell him no.</p>

<p>Ooh-</p>
<p>Welcome aboard!</p>
<p>It wasn't any easier.</p>
<p>Ah, these uniforms are a godsend.</p>
<p>Horseplay's down 40%. Youthful exuberance has been cut in half.</p>
<p>High spirits are at an all-time low.</p>
<p>They've even g*n blinking in unison.</p>
<p>I love that sound.</p>
<p>Now, children, while you're having quiet time...</p>
<p>I'm going to make sure my desk is exactly parallel to the rear wall.</p>
<p>Oh, there's something I used... to do in this situation, but can't remember.</p>
<p>Ha- ho?</p>
<p>I can't believe I got booted off the team for Mr. Businessman.</p>
<p>I bet I'll get a little respect once I get that Harvard diploma.</p>
<p>Look at that. All the way to the end with only one push.</p>
<p>That's the third game in a row he cost us, Homer.</p>
<p><em>Mamma mia.!</p>
<p>Hoot, mon!</em></p>
<p>Yee-haw!</p>
<p>Arr, me mateys. Arr.</p>
<p>Whoo! They begged me to join their team- begged me.</p>
<p>Well, we certainly got walloped tonight, eh, fellas?</p>
<p>Well-</p>
<p>Uh, Mr. Burns, next week is the big championship game.</p>
<p>Ah, yes, that silly championship.</p>
<p>The only ship worth a damn is friendship.</p>
<p>Look. Here comes the &quot;friend ship&quot; sailing your way.</p>
<p>Ooh, here. Let me get that, friend.</p>
<p>Oops. Lost a nail. Well, that's leprosy for you.</p>
<p>You're it.</p>
<p>Now you are the one who is it.</p>
<p>Understood.</p>
<p>Well, I've gotta hand it to you, Seymour. These drab student coverings... have created the perfect distraction-free environment... thus preparing the children for permanent positions in tomorrow's mills... and processing facilities.</p>
<p>Best of all, with less than a minute to go before I leave...</p>
<p><em>absolutely nothing has gone wrong.</em></p>
<p>Well, it is starting to rain, but I could hardly be blamed for that, can I?</p>
<p>Yes. Very good.</p>
<p>Wow! Look at all the colors, man!</p>
<p>Red, green, yellow, orange! I remember all of these!</p>
<p>I'm freaking out!</p>
<p>Hey, something's comin' back to me!</p>
<p><em>Down with homework!</p>
<p>And down with uniforms.!</em></p>
<p>Yea!</p>
<p>Ow, ow, ow, ow! Skinner... why aren't these uniforms colorfast?</p>
<p>I don't understand it. I got them at the same place I buy Mother's dresses, and-</p>
<p>Good Lord! Mother's in the park!</p>
<p>This I've gotta see.</p>
<p>Oh, Marge, we were so close to winning the championship.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to Burns, it's never gonna happen.</p>
<p>And I spent so much time building that trophy case.</p>
<p>Homer, maybe Mr. Burns will bowl a great game, and you will win your championship.</p>
<p>So you're saying we're definitely gonna win? Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p><em>I won't need this anymore.</p>
<p>Marge, someone broke the toilet.</em></p>
<p>Don't worry about nothin', Homer. I have a feeling... that Mr. Burns is gonna have a little accident that might keep him... from bowlin' with us tonight, heh, heh, heh.</p>
<p>Smithers, I'm afraid I won't be able to play tonight.</p>
<p>My old gimpy knee has gone akimbo again.</p>
<p>Take that!</p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p>Smithers, that precision as*ault popped it back into place. Thank you, masked stranger!</p>
<p>D'oh! He's gonna ruin everything! All right. That's it, Homer.</p>
<p>Either Burns goes, or Moe goes.</p>
<p>Yes, I am afraid that I am going to have to make a similar threat... with my name in place of Moe's name.</p>
<p>So, who's ready to kick some Christian keister?</p>
<p>Oh, uh, Mr. Burns, as team captain... it's my duty to inform you that-</p>
<p>Ooh, I almost forgot! I brought you all a little something.</p>
<p>Aww, would you look at that? The &quot;Pin Pals.&quot;</p>
<p>At last, I finally have a garment fine enough to be married in.</p>
<p>I've always been wealthy, but this is the first time I ever felt... rich.</p>
<p>Aww.</p>
<p>Now, Homer, you were about to say something to me.</p>
<p>You're off the team.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>He's just ribbin' ya, Monty.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Had you going there.</p>
<p>Guys.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey!</p>
<p><em>Hallelujah.</p>
<p>Hallelujah.!</em></p>
<p>Aww.</p>
<p>Nice one, Homer.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Okay. The Holy Rollers are ahead by one pin... and we only have one bowler left: Mr. Burns.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Well, next time, a few steps more toward center, don't you think?</p>
<p>Good-bye, trophy.</p>
<p>Ooh. Whatever I got ahold of is big.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Whoo-hoo! We won! We won!</p>
<p>You mean, I won.</p>
<p>But we were a team, sir.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm afraid I've had one of my trademark changes of heart.</p>
<p>You see, teamwork will only take you so far.</p>
<p>Then the truly evolved person makes that extra grab for personal glory.</p>
<p>Now I must discard my teammates, much like the boxer must shed roll after roll... of sweaty, useless, disgusting flab before he can win the title.</p>
<p>Ta.</p>
<p>I guess some people never change.</p>
<p>Or they quickly change and then quickly change back.</p>
<p>You know what? We don't need him or his trophy.</p>
<p>We got each other, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. That's right, Moe. Aww.</p>
<p><em>Go, Homer, you're our man! If you can't do it, nobody can!</em></p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p>No! Oh, God!</p>
<p>Well, I guess no one can.</p>
<p>Run, before they're through feeding!</p>
<p><em>No.! Oh, God.!</p>
<p>No.!</em></p>
<p>Shh!</p>
