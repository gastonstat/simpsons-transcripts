<p>[ Announcer ] Malibu Stacy, America's favorite eight-and-a-half-incher.</p>
<p>In I 959, homemaker Stacy Lavelle had a design and a dream.</p>
<p>The design? Malibu Stacy.</p>
<p>The dream? To mass-market a fashion doll that was also edible.</p>
<p>Kids didn't much like the taste of dried onion meal, but they loved the doll.</p>
<p>A second, plastic Malibu Stacy took America by storm.</p>
<p>Just ask the owner of the world's largest Malibu Stacy collection.: Waylon Smithers of Springfield.</p>
<p>Hello, Malibu Stacy collectors. I'll see you... at StacyCon '94, at the San Diego Airport Hilton.</p>
<p>[ Announcer ] And what does Stacy think ofher 35 years of success... and millions of friends worldwide?</p>
<p>Don't ask me. I'm just a girl! [ Giggles ]</p>
<p>[ Announcer, Chuckling ] She sure is.</p>
<p>Well, that's the tour.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer--</p>
<p>I have one.</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>Is the remarkably sexist drivel spouted by Malibu Stacy... intentional, or is it just a horrible mistake?</p>
<p>[ Chuckles ] Believe me, we're very mindful of such concerns.</p>
<p>♪ [ Wolf Whistle ]</p>
<p>Hey,Jiggles! Grab a pad and back that gorgeous butt in here.</p>
<p>Oh, you. Get away! [ Chuckles ]</p>

<p>Everyone listens to me, no matter how dumb my suggestions are.</p>
<p>[ Chewing Noisily ]</p>
<p>But I'm not gonna accomplish anything just sitting here-- and gripin', it's time for-- action!</p>
<p>I've got to talk to that woman who invented Malibu Stacy... and see if I can get her to-- come out of retirement!</p>
<p>I'm gonna get me a job! A real Malibu... and see if Stacy... can help... invent... me... young-- Help!</p>
<p>You're getting a job!</p>
<p>Yes! I'm going where the action is!</p>

<p>Yes? I-- [ Chuckles ] Why, it's Homer Simpson's daughter.</p>
<p>I thought you might be able to help me get in touch with the inventor of Malibu Stacy.</p>
<p>Whew! [ Chuckles ] That would be quite a feat.</p>
<p>Stacy Lavelle is a total recluse.</p>
<p>She hasn't appeared in public in 20 years.</p>
<p>Here, I'm writing an article on her for my next Malibu Stacy newsletter.</p>
<p>It contains her last known whereabouts.</p>
<p>I'll, uh, print you out a copy.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>[ Scoffs ] Not since I was forced out in I 97 4.</p>
<p>They said my way of thinking just wasn't cost-effective.</p>
<p>That's awful!</p>
<p>Well, that, and...</p>
<p>I was funneling profits to the Vietcong.</p>
<p>But you are Malibu Stacy. As long as she has your name, you have the responsibility!</p>
<p>I'd be mortified if someone ever made a lousy product with the Simpson name on it.</p>
<p>I may have had things in common with Stacy in the beginning... but 30 years of living her lifestyle taught me some very harsh lessons.</p>
<p>Five husbands: Ken,Johnny,Joe...</p>
<p>Dr. Colossus, Steve Austin.</p>
<p>But if you can learn from Malibu Stacy's mistakes, so can everyone.</p>
