<p> LENNY, CARL AND BARNEY: 27 28 Okay, Homer, this is the last pickled egg.</p>
<p> Keep it down and you win 50 bucks.</p>
<p> Okay.</p>
<p> If I win, we're going out for omelets.</p>
<p> Yeah!</p>
<p> I am the champion of this very bad idea.</p>
<p> Uh-oh.</p>
<p> He's gonna blow.</p>
<p> Hey, Moe, you're not gonna serve those eggs, are you?</p>
<p> No, no.</p>
<p> I, uh, I find another use for them.</p>
<p> Hmm.</p>
<p> I was 50 bucks up until I blew every egg out of my belly.</p>
<p> Oh!</p>
<p> Whoa!</p>
<p> Hey, there, pal.</p>
<p> I'm afraid that was the mayor's favorite light pole.</p>
<p> You give me the car, I give you 500 bucks and I make all of this go away.</p>
<p> Uh, this is awkward.</p>
<p> You don't have to thank me.</p>
<p> Ugh!</p>
<p> Marge.</p>
<p> When you start a sentence with &quot;Marge,&quot; it's really bad.</p>
<p> Marge, Marge, Marge.</p>
<p> I sold our car.</p>
<p> - What are you gonna drive?</p>
<p> - Your car.</p>
<p> Oh.</p>
<p> Well, then I guess I'll be riding the bus.</p>
<p> That's right.</p>
<p> Like rock stars and Rosa Parks.</p>
<p> Now just wait till you see what's become of our car.</p>
<p> Feast your eyes on this.</p>
<p> Why are you showing me this?</p>
<p> I don't get it.</p>
<p> And I'm crying.</p>
<p> Lousy wrong channel.</p>
<p> The Legends of Demolition Derby-Derby-Derby are coming to Springfield- Springfield-Springfield!</p>
<p> So shut up!</p>
<p> And get your ass-ass-ass over-over-over here-here-here!</p>
<p> Proceeds go to stuttering-stuttering-stuttering.</p>
<p> Wait for it.</p>
<p> Wait for it.</p>
<p> We've got all the Demolition Derby greats!</p>
<p> Vince &quot;Dead Tooth&quot; McGee!</p>
<p> James &quot;Psychiatric Disorder&quot; Porter.</p>
<p> &quot;Meth&quot; MacFarland.</p>
<p> Mysterious Fandango and a very drunk Billy Joel.</p>
<p> I'm sorry, but most of these names mean nothing to me.</p>
<p> Here it comes!</p>
<p> And making his triumphant return to the Crash Zone after a full skull transplant, Gene &quot;No Helmet&quot; Dupree!</p>
<p> Eh?</p>
<p> My car in a demolition derby!</p>
<p> And we got primo tickets for Saturday night.</p>
<p> Look at them fan.</p>
<p> Wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p> This is the point where Lisa always ruins it.</p>
<p> No, I'm good with it.</p>
<p> People get out their aggression and destroy carbon-burning cars.</p>
<p> See?</p>
<p> Ruined it.</p>
<p> And then I noticed there wasn't any more cinnamon on top of my rice pudding.</p>
<p> And I said, &quot;Where's the cinnamon?</p>
<p>&quot; And they said, &quot;There never was any cinnamon, Abe.</p>
<p> &quot; Fine, Dad, we'll get you some cinnamon!</p>
<p> I can't tolerate cinnamon!</p>
<p> So, I started asking everyone in the TV room if they remembered the cinnamon and the answer will surprise you.</p>
<p> The results were incon When did you get that put in?</p>
<p> Worth every penny.</p>
<p> But how many pennies is that?</p>
<p> Homer Simpson, you can't just Hmm.</p>
<p> All right, young'uns.</p>
<p> You know that movie Cars that you likes?</p>
<p> Uh-huh.</p>
<p> Well, all your favorite characters is gonna commit su1c1de here today.</p>
<p> - Huh?</p>
<p> - What?</p>
<p> Ladies and gentlemen, please silence all cell phones and holster all truck nuts.</p>
<p> And now, in conformance with the latest paleontological theories about dinosaurs, please welcome the all-new Truckasaurus Two.</p>
<p> I love you, Steven Spielberg.</p>
<p> Now, a brief moment in memory of those we lost in the past week.</p>
<p> And now let the bash-'em-ups begin!</p>
<p> If I get hit by a brain, can I keep it?</p>
<p> Be sure to get it signed afterwards.</p>
<p> There's our car!</p>
<p> Wow.</p>
<p> Without Dad's weight in it, it really moves.</p>
<p> Oh, my God, this is it.</p>
<p> Only one car stands in our way.</p>
<p> It's down to Homer's Boner and Car-rak Obama, the Affordable Healthcare Mobile, which you can't k*ll no matter how hard you try.</p>
<p> My whole life has been leading to this one moment.</p>
<p> Oh!</p>
<p> My chest hurts!</p>
<p> That's called pride.</p>
<p> My arm is numb!</p>
<p> Numb with pride.</p>
<p> Son, I need to go to the hospital.</p>
<p> Huh?</p>
<p> Sure, Dad.</p>
<p> I missed it.</p>
<p> Can you see the pain you're causing him?</p>
<p> Go on, git!</p>
<p> I'm sorry to say it, uh, doesn't look good.</p>
<p> Homer, your father would like to see you, uh, one last time.</p>
<p> I hope you've got a return receipt on that balloon.</p>
<p> I always do.</p>
<p> Homer, there's something I need to tell you.</p>
<p> I'll give you two a moment in this, uh, semiprivate room.</p>
<p> Where is the nurse with my Son, I did a terrible thing many years ago and I need you to forgive me before before it's too late.</p>
<p> Anything, Dad.</p>
<p> Uh-huh.</p>
<p> Uh-huh.</p>
<p> You already said that part.</p>
<p> Remember, you can't tell anyone.</p>
<p> It's awful!</p>
<p> I swear.</p>
<p> Now get to the point.</p>
<p> You didn't!</p>
<p> Okay.</p>
<p> I forgive you.</p>
<p> Your conscience is the one clean thing in this room.</p>
<p> Well, we tried everything we could and the last thing worked.</p>
<p> How did you save him?</p>
<p> When a body is in too much pain, the brain releases a hormone to bring a merciful death.</p>
<p> But an expensive new drug blocks that and keeps him alive.</p>
<p> What a glorious day!</p>
<p> I'm gonna live and my son has forgiven me for the worst thing I ever did.</p>
<p> Yes.</p>
<p> Forgiven.</p>
<p> Sir, you just destroyed a box of hospital cotton balls.</p>
<p> - That's $75,000.</p>
<p> - D'oh!</p>
<p> Now I want to watch my favorite new show, currently in its 17th season.</p>
<p> It looks like another m*rder at Jackson Island Naval Base.</p>
<p> That's what makes America great.</p>
<p> Prompt investigation of in-house naval crimes.</p>
<p> Homie, look who's here.</p>
<p> Yeah, I see.</p>
<p> Oh, Homer, are you a Sunday puzzle?</p>
<p> 'Cause you sure seem down and a'cross.</p>
<p> My dad did something to me I can never forgive.</p>
<p> No worse than what God did to his son and they wrote a book together.</p>
<p> Bye.</p>
<p> He tricked me with his code blue and his flatlining.</p>
<p> And I fell for it like a sap.</p>
<p> What did he do?</p>
<p> I promised him not to say what he told me, but I will never look at him the same way again.</p>
<p> Yeah, but you forgave me, so that means you have to love me.</p>
<p> Nyeah, nyeah, nyeah, nyeah, nyeah.</p>
<p> Marjorie, I'm sorry, but I do not want to be in the same room with this man.</p>
<p> I'm going to Moe's.</p>
<p> Then I'm going to Moe's!</p>
<p> Then I'm staying here.</p>
<p> A g*n and a sailor hat.</p>
<p> Nothing screams naval crime more than that.</p>
<p> I'm going to Moe's.</p>
<p> I hate seeing a father and a son sit at opposite ends of the bar 'cause it means I got to walk more.</p>
<p> Now come on, youse guys.</p>
<p> Bury the ol' hatchet.</p>
<p> Hey, life is short.</p>
<p> You could be k*ll by a drunk driver, die of cirrhosis, stabbed in a bar fight.</p>
<p> All kinds of random bad things happen to my customers.</p>
<p> All right, look, here's 50 cents, huh?</p>
<p> Play the jukebox and the love tester.</p>
<p> You heard Ray Charles.</p>
<p> Actually, in my jukebox, we can't afford no Ray Charles.</p>
<p> It's a white guy named, uh, Charles Ray.</p>
<p> Excellent vision, excellent vision.</p>
<p> Dad, Grampa, the place we're going is the perfect way to make you guys friends again.</p>
<p> I went there for Janey's last birthday party.</p>
<p> You think you can solve our problems at a kids' birthday party place?</p>
<p> It's cheaper than therapy and it comes with cake.</p>
<p> If cake solved problems, Homer would have a Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
<p> That's a bullcrap prize.</p>
<p> They gave it to Kissinger.</p>
<p> Welcome to the Escape Zone.</p>
<p> The latest attempt to get people to save a dying mall.</p>
<p> Now, would you like to be buried alive?</p>
<p> Done it for real.</p>
<p> How about Medieval Dungeon?</p>
<p> Got to be less torture than listening to him.</p>
<p> Hey.</p>
<p> Thank you.</p>
<p> Okay, you two are trapped in a dungeon.</p>
<p> The only way out is to solve ten puzzles by working together.</p>
<p> Yeah, whatever.</p>
<p> Super!</p>
<p> They're just sitting there.</p>
<p> I bet they'd hurry if they knew we had balloons.</p>
<p> They're moving.</p>
<p> Son, if you take this sword and stick it in that magic portal, I think it might open a bookcase somewhere.</p>
<p> Yes, that makes perfect sense.</p>
<p> I'll just Homer?</p>
<p> You're not getting out to say good-bye to your dad?</p>
<p> He's probably afraid we'll see how much the car lifts when he gets out.</p>
<p> No, I'm not.</p>
<p> There's only one way to make you guys understand.</p>
<p> I'll tell you what Grampa told me.</p>
<p> That was in confidence.</p>
<p> And in this family, we keep our promises.</p>
<p> Starting now.</p>
<p> I am telling.</p>
<p> Oh, God.</p>
<p> Oh, God.</p>
<p> I hate conflict.</p>
<p> - Then just leave your body.</p>
<p> - Okay.</p>
<p> Hey!</p>
<p> When I was growing up, my dad loved to make model World w*r II airplanes.</p>
<p> Watch it, son.</p>
<p> You're gonna break the wing.</p>
<p> Oh, now you got glue up your nose.</p>
<p> Oh!</p>
<p> Don't eat the decal.</p>
<p> How many have you had?</p>
<p> Just leave me be.</p>
<p> Oh!</p>
<p> I work hard all week at the model plane factory, and this hobby is my one escape.</p>
<p> Can you please watch this little monster?</p>
<p> When he gave me to her, it was the best thing he could've done.</p>
<p> - This is the dough.</p>
<p> - Dough.</p>
<p><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content"><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle transcripts-topic-in-post" style="display:inline-block" data-full-width-responsive="true" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3808023418243141" data-ad-slot="1728561479"></ins>
<p><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div></p>
<p> Yes, dough.</p>
<p> Now, I need someone very strong to roll this out.</p>
<p> Love you.</p>
<p> She loved me.</p>
<p> And for each pie she made, she wrote down the recipe and put a special note to me on the back.</p>
<p> We don't know what life will bring, so on your birthday or any day you need it, you'll know that your mother loved you and have reasons to love yourself.</p>
<p> You just taught me food is love.</p>
<p> I like myself.</p>
<p> That lunch box was the most valuable possession I ever had.</p>
<p> When she left, those recipes were all I had left of her.</p>
<p> And that's the end.</p>
<p> What a sweet story.</p>
<p> And there's some things that shouldn't be gone into until a man is dead and can't be kicked.</p>
<p> After she ran away, my father was furious and did something terrible.</p>
<p> He threw my recipes off a cliff.</p>
<p> Everything that reminded him of her.</p>
<p> He lied to me.</p>
<p> He told me she took the recipes with her when she left.</p>
<p> Are you sure, Daddy?</p>
<p> Yes.</p>
<p> And don't ask me again till I'm on my deathbed.</p>
<p> Wait.</p>
<p> Why are you looking like that?</p>
<p> If this man had had those notes, his life would've been different.</p>
<p> He would've had confidence.</p>
<p> He would've had his mother with him!</p>
<p> I would've had hair!</p>
<p> Homie, that's not very realistic.</p>
<p> And I would've been more realistic.</p>
<p> - Grampa, so thoughtless.</p>
<p> - Mean old man.</p>
<p> His slippers don't even have bottoms anymore.</p>
<p> I never thought I'd say this word, but here it comes: coot.</p>
<p> Homer, why are you smiling?</p>
<p> We're finally hating together as a family.</p>
<p> What do you say we all go to that home and yell at Grampa?</p>
<p> Oh, that would be lovely.</p>
<p> Now enjoy this sweet song of hate.</p>
<p> If I could save hate in a bottle The first thing that I'd like to do Is to hate every day Till eternity passes away Then end with a giant screw you But there never seems to be enough time To hate the things you want to hate Once you hate them.</p>
<p> - Lousy Grampa.</p>
<p> - So heartless.</p>
<p> Always calls me &quot;buddy&quot; or &quot;fella.</p>
<p> &quot; Don't forget he's hard of hearing.</p>
<p> Lousy Grampa!</p>
<p> So heartless!</p>
<p> What you did was crap, Grampa!</p>
<p> - I want to yell at him first.</p>
<p> - I want to yell at him first.</p>
<p> Hey, has anyone considered the silent treatment?</p>
<p> The silent treatment doesn't work.</p>
<p> It doesn't work.</p>
<p> It does not work.</p>
<p> Okay, fine, it works.</p>
<p> It works so well.</p>
<p> Please say something.</p>
<p> How long has it been?</p>
<p> Three months?</p>
<p> I don't even remember a time before this.</p>
<p> Where's Grampa?</p>
<p> - He hasn't touched his lunch.</p>
<p> - Or his lunch meds.</p>
<p> &quot;My beloved family&quot; Oh, boy.</p>
<p> &quot;I've learned an important lesson, never get things off your chest.</p>
<p> Which reminds me of a gal named Chesty Lazar.</p>
<p> She ran a speakeasy on Hawaii right before Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p> Pearl Harbor was the name of the lady who bought the joint&quot; Digression digression Crazy talk Ah, here's the end.</p>
<p> The point is, confessing don't really make you feel better, 'cause it don't redo the bad thing you did.</p>
<p> So I'm gonna undo what I done if it's the last thing I do.</p>
<p> Hmm.</p>
<p> Mm.</p>
<p> Oh, no.</p>
<p> He's heading for that cliff to look for those recipes.</p>
<p> I'm gonna find him, save him, and tell him I can't wait till he dies.</p>
<p> Leave me alone.</p>
<p> I'm gonna find it.</p>
<p> Don't do it, Dad!</p>
<p> Most is forgiven!</p>
<p> Wait, what's your rope tied to?</p>
<p> - Hmm?</p>
<p> - Hmm?</p>
<p> Oh, my God.</p>
<p> Please be okay.</p>
<p> Please be okay.</p>
<p> Oh Hmm?</p>
<p> Don't worry, son.</p>
<p> This will give you all the rope you need.</p>
<p> Dad, no!</p>
<p> I love you.</p>
<p> Mom left, but you were there.</p>
<p> Cranky, a little drunk, sometimes not there, but you were always there.</p>
<p> Oh.</p>
<p> You love me.</p>
<p> That's all I need to hear.</p>
<p> Good thing I also threw out your mother's bed when she left.</p>
<p> I can still smell her perfume.</p>
<p> And I've got the recipes back.</p>
<p> Huh?</p>
<p> Oh.</p>
<p> They're gone, just like Mom.</p>
<p> - I'm sorry, son.</p>
<p> - It's okay, Dad.</p>
<p> Life doesn't always give you neat endings that tie everything up in a bow.</p>
<p> Mmm.</p>
<p> This pie is fantastic.</p>
<p> It's what I imagine eating great jazz would be like.</p>
<p> Always with the jazz.</p>
<p> It tastes exactly like my mom used to make.</p>
<p> Exactly!</p>
<p> Excuse me, how the hell did you get this recipe?</p>
<p> It was a miracle, actually.</p>
<p> 33 years ago, this place wasn't doing well, possibly due to our location under a cliff.</p>
<p> I went out to contemplate my fate when suddenly, like a gift from God, the recipes came.</p>
<p> I'd never seen such recipes, such brilliant fruit combinations and such beautiful messages on the back.</p>
<p> Those messages were for me.</p>
<p> Well, then you should have them.</p>
<p> Everything tied up in a bow.</p>
<p> What's it say?</p>
<p> It says, uh &quot;Your father is an okay guy.</p>
<p> &quot; - Aw, thanks for telling me.</p>
<p> - Thanks for buying it.</p>
<p> Mr.</p>
<p> Simpson, based on your budget, I am afraid there's only one car on this lot you can afford.</p>
<p> You know this car?</p>
<p> Do I!</p>
<p> Aw, I thought that's where you were.</p>
<p> Geez, what's wrong with her</p>
