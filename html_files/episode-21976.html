							<p>And Maggie Makes Three.</p>
<p>We now return to.</p>
<p>Knightboat: The Crime-Solving Boat.</p>
<p>Faster, Knightboat. Gotta catch those starfish poachers.</p>
<p>Don't have to yell, Michael. I'm all around you.</p>
<p>Oh, no. They're headed for land.</p>
<p>We'll never catch them now.</p>
<p>Incorrect. Look, a canal.</p>
<p>Go, Knightboat, go.</p>
<p>Every week, there's a canal.</p>
<p>Or an inlet.</p>
<p>Or a fjord.</p>
<p>Quiet! I won't hear another word against the boat.</p>
<p>Okay, TV off. It's family time.</p>
<p>But, Marge... Knightboat: The Crime-Solving Boat.</p>
<p>Homer, you promised, one night of family time a week.</p>
<p>Besides, that back-talking boat sets a bad example.</p>
<p>Says you, woman.</p>
<p>Hey, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Mom.</p>
<p>All right, family time begins now.</p>
<p>Homer.</p>
<p>It was Bart.</p>
<p>Why don't we all look at the photo album.</p>
<p>So many memories.</p>
<p>Oh, look, Knightboat.</p>
<p>And here's our TV next to the mirror.</p>
<p>It looks like we have two.</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, two. Let's get to the baby pictures.</p>
<p>Mom.</p>
<p>That's exciting.</p>
<p>Oh, please.</p>
<p>Here's Bart sleeping.</p>
<p>Here he is dozing.</p>
<p>Here he is after a visit from the sandman.</p>
<p>Here's nappy time, Bart.</p>
<p>Here's a cute one. He's all tuckered out.</p>
<p>Why aren't there any pictures of Maggie?</p>
<p>Well, I'm glad you asked. It's actually a very interesting story.</p>
<p>It all began about two years ago, before Maggie was even born.</p>
<p>Bart, you were Lisa's age. And, Lisa... you were the age Bart was several years ago.</p>
<p>Get the camera ready, Bart very sleepy.</p>
<p>Listen carefully, and my words will shape images... as clear as any TV show.</p>
<p>It was a tumultuous time for our nation.</p>
<p>The clear-beverage craze gave us all a reason to live.</p>
<p>The information superhighway showed the average person... what some nerd thinks about Star Trek.</p>
<p>And the domestication of the dog continued unabated.</p>
<p>I was at my workstation when suddenly...</p>
<p>Attention, American workers.</p>
<p>Your plant has been taken over by an all-star team of freelance t*rrorists.</p>
<p>Not on my shift!</p>
<p>No, you don't.</p>
<p>Simpson, 10, t*rrorists, 8.</p>
<p>Homer, tell the story right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Homer, you should see a doctor.</p>
<p>I don't think a healthy man can make that kind of smell.</p>
<p>Your paychecks, gentlemen.</p>
<p>This is it. With a single glorious check... I'm finally completely out of debt.</p>
<p>Yes! With my bills paid off, I can finally quit this lousy job.</p>
<p>But, Homer, how you gonna make a living?</p>
<p>Don't worry about Homer J. I've got a plan.</p>
<p>A plan that'll fix you good.</p>
<p>Hey, what did we do?</p>
<p>Sorry, that just slipped out. I'll miss you.</p>
<p>Did you hear me? I said, I quit, Monty.</p>
<p>And since I quit, I can do anything I want.</p>
<p>Is that so?</p>
<p>Lovely desk. It would be too bad if someone... oh, I don't know, didn't use a coaster!</p>
<p>Such a nice, tidy office.</p>
<p>Maybe it's time you started living like a pig!</p>
<p>Oh, I hope I haven't upset you... bongo head!</p>
<p>Oh, I should be resisting this, but I'm paralyzed with rage... and island rhythms.</p>
<p>Go, Homer. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Way to play the boss's head like a bongo, Homer.</p>
<p>He's getting a pretty good sound out of that guy.</p>
<p>That's for employing me for eight years.</p>
<p>And that is that.</p>
<p>Goodbye, mind-numbing, backbreaking labor forever.</p>
<p>Hello, dream job in paradise.</p>
<p>And now, the final phase of my plan.</p>
<p>Barney, any chance you can get me a job?</p>
<p>Hey. Sure, Homer. I told you, my uncle owns the place.</p>
<p>Hey, Uncle Al, can Homer have a job?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Barney, you're fired.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Show up tomorrow. Bring three rags.</p>
<p>Oh, and a change of pants.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>When it happens, you'll know.</p>
<p>You're a pin monkey?</p>
<p>Finally, I don't have to be ashamed of my father's job.</p>
<p>It's romantic, throwing off the shackles of the workaday world... and following a dream, of sorts.</p>
<p>I don't know if it's such a good idea.</p>
<p>Can we get by on a pin monkey's salary?</p>
<p>Don't worry, Marge.</p>
<p>I've come up with a perfectly balanced budget.</p>
<p>There will be exactly enough money for you, me, Bart and Lisa... if we make a few small sacrifices.</p>
<p>From now on, we use regular toilet paper... not that fancy quilted kind.</p>
<p>And only one of you kids can go to college.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>That night, your mom and I went out for a romantic evening... to celebrate the start of our new life.</p>
<p>We began with dinner and dancing.</p>
<p>Followed by a stroll on the beach.</p>
<p>Marge.</p>
<p>Homer.</p>
<p>I've got sand in my underpants.</p>
<p>Me too. Let's go home.</p>
<p>I love you, Marge.</p>
<p>I love you too, Homie.</p>
<p>Everything in our lives is finally perfectly balanced.</p>
<p>I hope things stay exactly like this forever.</p>
<p>Did you have to be so graphic?</p>
<p>It's okay, Marge. They pave the way for this kind of filth in school.</p>
<p>Dad, were you excited that Mom was pregnant?</p>
<p>Actually, your mother hadn't told me yet.</p>
<p>At that time, I had no idea Maggie even existed.</p>
<p>Dad!</p>
<p>Dad!</p>
<p>Hi, Maggie.</p>
<p>So anyhow, back then there was no way for me to know... your mother was pregnant.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Marge, you tie up the bathroom every morning. I've gotta wash my hair.</p>
<p>The next few weeks at my dream job were like a wonderful waking coma.</p>
<p>Hey, Homer.</p>
<p>Hi there, Homer.</p>
<p>Hi, Homer.</p>
<p>Hi there, Homer.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Bowling-fresh.</p>
<p>Urinal-fresh.</p>
<p>Homer, did you polish your head in the Shine-O Ball-O?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay, then.</p>
<p>I slowly learned the intricate mysteries of the alley... like where the pins go after they're knocked down.</p>
<p>I was in heaven. If horseracing is the sport of kings... then surely, bowling... is a very good sport as well.</p>
<p>Hey, great job, Homer.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot, Homer.</p>
<p>Hey, you're the best.</p>
<p>I'm gonna make it after all.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Mrs. Simpson. You're pregnant.</p>
<p>Am I to take it that this is... an unwanted pregnancy?</p>
<p>Oh, no, no. Not exactly.</p>
<p>It's just that I haven't told Homer yet. With his new job... I don't know how we'll be able to afford this.</p>
<p>Well, you know, a healthy baby can bring upwards of $60,000.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>Of course, that was just a test.</p>
<p>Had you reacted differently, why, you'd be in jail right now. Simply a test.</p>
<p>So in a few months, both of you will have a brand-new brother or sister.</p>
<p>Been there, done that.</p>
<p>I hope it's a girl.</p>
<p>You know nothing about genetics, Lis. It goes boy, girl, boy, girl.</p>
<p>You're worried about telling Dad.</p>
<p>Why do you say that?</p>
<p>Well, you've been in my room for about four hours now.</p>
<p>Hey, I'm just hanging.</p>
<p><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content"><br />

<p><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div></p>
<p>Homie, l...</p>
<p>Can't talk. Praying.</p>
<p>Dear Lord, the gods have been good to me, and I am thankful.</p>
<p>For the first time in my life, everything is absolutely perfect... just the way it is.</p>
<p>So here's the deal: You freeze everything as it is... and I won't ask for anything more.</p>
<p>If that is okay, please give me absolutely no sign.</p>
<p>Okay, deal. In gratitude, I present you this offering of cookies and milk.</p>
<p>If you want me to eat them for you, give me no sign. Thy will be done.</p>
<p>I've got to tell Homer about this baby in just the right way... and at just the right time.</p>
<p>Until then, please keep this to yourselves.</p>
<p>If he found out now, it would probably destroy him, huh?</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>Gotta go.</p>
<p>Gotta go.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Wait. I know that look.</p>
<p>Now, promise you won't tell Homer.</p>
<p>Oh, we promise we won't tell... Homer.</p>
<p>Hello. Is this A. Aaronson?</p>
<p>It might interest you to know that Marge Simpson is pregnant again.</p>
<p>Just thought you'd like to know, Mr. Zowkowski.</p>
<p>There. Aaronson and Zowkowski are the two biggest gossips in town.</p>
<p>In an hour, everyone will know.</p>
<p>Another perfect day in my perfect life with my perfect job.</p>
<p>Hey, just heard the news over the squawk box.</p>
<p>That's nice work, Homer.</p>
<p>Thank you. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>It is nice work.</p>
<p>Oh, Mr. Simpson, I have just heard about the little bundle of joy.</p>
<p>Congratulations, sir.</p>
<p>It's true, the bundle is little... but I'm not in it for the money.</p>
<p>Hey, Homer, way to get Marge pregnant.</p>
<p>This is getting very abstract, but thank you... I do enjoy working at the bowling alley.</p>
<p>Surprise! Baby shower.</p>
<p>Baby shower? You know I haven't told Homer yet.</p>
<p>And he'll be home any minute.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Man, it's windy as hell out there.</p>
<p>Hey, wait a minute. What are all these presents?</p>
<p>It looks like you're... showering Marge with gifts.</p>
<p>With little, tiny baby-sized gifts.</p>
<p>Well, I'll be in the tub.</p>
<p>By the way, congratulations on your new job, Homer.</p>
<p>New job? Marge is pregnant?!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Dad, you really threw a tantrum like a little sissy girl?</p>
<p>Oh, just that one time.</p>
<p>Actually, when I was about to have Bart...</p>
<p>You're pregnant?!</p>
<p>And then when I told him about Lisa...</p>
<p>You're pregnant again?!</p>
<p>Who wouldn't be upset?</p>
<p>That new baby in your mother's womb was a ticking time b*mb... threatening to blow this family eight ways from Sunday.</p>
<p>Where are you going?</p>
<p>You can't expect a person... to sit for 30 minutes straight.</p>
<p>I'm gonna get a snack and maybe go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>I'll stay here, but I'm gonna think about products I might like to purchase.</p>
<p>I don't have that.</p>
<p>You're pregnant.</p>
<p>We're gonna have to have a baby. All our financial plans are ruined.</p>
<p>We're doomed. Doomed, I tells you!</p>
<p>Bart, let your father tell the story.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, but I know funny.</p>
<p>Anyhoo...</p>
<p>We're doomed!</p>
<p>Homer, you had a head.</p>
<p>Check.</p>
<p>And your bottom was a little bigger.</p>
<p>You've worked hard at the bowling alley.</p>
<p>Why don't you ask for a raise.</p>
<p>Yeah, a raise.</p>
<p>I've never been good enough at any job to deserve one.</p>
<p>But I'm damn good at this one. That's it.</p>
<p>I'm gonna march right up to Al and say: Steve. I mean, Al, I think I deserve a raise.</p>
<p>You're a hard worker. I'd like to give you a raise.</p>
<p>But the alley just ain't doing enough business to pay that kind of money.</p>
<p>How about if I triple the business? Then could I get a raise?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, but...</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Bowling. Bowling here.</p>
<p>Come bowl now. Get your bowling.</p>
<p>Who's ready? Bowling.</p>
<p>Mom, make Dad tell the story right.</p>
<p>That's what really happened.</p>
<p>My marketing plan attracted a record number of police and fire officials... but few stayed to bowl. I failed.</p>
<p>Quitting my dream job was the hardest thing I've ever done.</p>
<p>You did a great job, Homer.</p>
<p>I'm really gonna miss you. Place has never been cleaner.</p>
<p>And the way you kept the young people away, that was beautiful.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Thanks for that.</p>
<p>Anyway, we all pitched in, and we got you this little going-away thing.</p>
<p>This was the happiest time of my life.</p>
<p>I'll never forget you guys.</p>
<p>Especially you, Joey.</p>
<p>See you around, Mr. Homer.</p>
<p>Don't worry, Joey.</p>
<p>We'll make it to California someday.</p>
<p>Sure, we will, Mr. Homer. Sure, we will.</p>
<p>It's gonna be sad around here without you, Homer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sure is.</p>
<p>Boy, this is depressing.</p>
<p>I know what'd cheer us up. Bowling.</p>
<p>Look at this, I got a ball here.</p>
<p>I feel happy now. Hey.</p>
<p>Boy, this is fun.</p>
<p>I needed more money to support my growing family.</p>
<p>And there was only one place in town that a man like me could make it.</p>
<p>Acid rain again.</p>
<p>Yes? Are you a new applicant?</p>
<p>I quit, and I came to get my job back.</p>
<p>Through there.</p>
<p>So come crawling back, eh?</p>
<p>Seems like the classy thing to do would be not to call attention to it.</p>
<p>Thanks for giving me my old job back.</p>
<p>I'm afraid it's not that simple.</p>
<p>As punishment for your desertion... it's company policy to give you the plague.</p>
<p>Sir, that's the &quot;plaque.&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, the special de-motivational plaque... to break what's left of your spirit.</p>
<p>Because, you see, you're here forever.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't forget: You're here forever.&quot;</p>
<p>I've never been so miserable in all my life.</p>
<p>But I can't take it out on Marge and the kids.</p>
<p>I've gotta carry the burden all by myself.</p>
<p>Hi, honey. How are you?</p>
<p>Well, actually...</p>
<p>Oh, I can't go on with this charade. I hate my job. I hate my life.</p>
<p>Since I found out about this baby, there's been only bad luck.</p>
<p>My contractions started an hour ago.</p>
<p>Just in one ear and out the other with you, isn't it?</p>
<p>This is incredible. It's God's most wondrous miracle.</p>
<p>Sir, I think your wife wants to hold the baby.</p>
<p>My wife? Where? Where?</p>
<p>Congratulations. It's a boy.</p>
<p>You're truly the catch of the day.</p>
<p>It's wonderful. It's magical. Oh, boy.</p>
<p>Here it comes, another mouth.</p>
<p>One more push should do it.</p>
<p>Marvelous.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Mr. Simpson. You have a beautiful, healthy baby.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Homie, I think someone is saying hello.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>It's a boy. And what a boy!</p>
<p>That's the umbilical cord. It's a girl.</p>
<p>A girl. Oh, Marge, we have a wonderful baby girl.</p>
<p>Not just a girl. The most beautiful baby girl in the whole world.</p>
<p>Come on, Marge, show a little enthusiasm.</p>
<p>So you loved her right from the start.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Then why no pictures?</p>
<p>Oh, there are pictures.</p>
<p>I keep them where I need the most cheering up.</p>
