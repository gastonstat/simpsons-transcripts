<p>(BRAKES SCREECHING)</p>
<p>(SPRAYING)</p>
<p>Are you sure we can make money doing this?</p>
<p>What if nobody wants their address painted on the curb?</p>
<p>Duh! Nobody wants their address painted on the curb.</p>
<p>We do it without asking, and then they have to pay.</p>
<p>What are you punks doin?</p>
<p>(COCKS g*n)</p>
<p>Answer me, or I'll drop ya like a bad cell phone plan!</p>
<p>Sorry. This thing goes off on its own.</p>
<p>Anyway, you were sayin&quot;?</p>
<p>Ignore that.</p>
<p>We painted your address on the curb.</p>
<p>And since you didn't tell us not to, you owe us 10 bucks.</p>
<p>Wow. A number on the curb?</p>
<p>That really classes the joint up.</p>
<p>Yep, things are finally going my way.</p>
<p>I struck oil! I struck oil!</p>
<p>(VOCALIZING)</p>
<p>I struck oil!</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Uh, when do we tell him that's not oil?</p>
<p>Ah, let him have his fun.</p>
<p>Oil! Oil!</p>
<p>Only $10 to paint my curb like a common whore?</p>
<p>Well, I'm happy to pay for a three-digit spray.</p>
<p>Tell you what. I'll give you another $100 if you paint my garage.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. That's not a scam!</p>
<p>That's honest work for honest pay!</p>
<p>(All) No!</p>
<p>I'll throw in some Christian comic books!</p>
<p>Please! Somebody take them!</p>
<p>Screw you. I'm never gonna pay.</p>
<p>Well, then we're gonna leave you one digit short.</p>
<p>(NELSON GRUNTS)</p>
<p>Fine. I'll finish it myself.</p>
<p>And don't think I'm gonna screw it up, because I won't!</p>
<p>(HOMER LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Dad, all you had to do was paint one number.</p>
<p>Now no oneâ€™s gonna be able to find our house.</p>
<p>But, sweetie, I just wanted to tell the '74 Oakland A's how I felt about them.</p>
<p>Look, that guy remembers us!</p>
<p>(BRAKES SCREECH)</p>
<p>Hey, Sal Bando, give him a '74 A's &quot;thank you honk.&quot;</p>
<p>(HORN HONKS)</p>
<p>My work here is done.</p>
<p>(HUMMING)</p>
<p>(DOORBELL RINGS)</p>
<p>(GASPS) I'm needed at the door!</p>
<p>I have a delivery for a Scott and Brenda Weingarten, 74 Evergreen Terrace.</p>
<p>74? Oh, sorry. There's been a mistake.</p>
<p>Oh, no problem.</p>
<p>I'll just ship these juicy, mail-order steaks back to Omaha.</p>
<p>Uh, on second thought, I am Brenda Winecooler.</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Dad, isn't it wrong to open or eat other people's mail?</p>
<p>Son, all our mail has ever brought me is bad things.</p>
<p>Bills, jury duty, Entertainment Weekly.</p>
<p>Now, for once, I'm getting rich-person mail.</p>
<p>You wouldn't take that away from me, would you, son?</p>
<p>Oh, Dad, no one can rationalize like you.</p>
<p>Okay, Weingartens, what else is in your mail?</p>
<p>Oh! Marge, do you wanna go to a wedding of a couple we never met?</p>
<p>Strangers getting married?</p>
<p>I wouldn't miss it for the world.</p>
<p>Mark and Tracy, I remember the first words I heard you say, &quot;l do.&quot;</p>
<p>Your cousin Scott is so sweet.</p>
<p>But didn't you say he was blind?</p>
<p>That's what I heard, but he's so confident in his movements.</p>
<p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p>
<p>(ON TV) <em>This is Kent Brockman in the Springfield Keys, reporting to you from the middle of a hurricane.</p>
<p>The lid from my coffee cup is long gone.</em></p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p><em>I'm scared, people. Truly scared.</em></p>
<p>(CHUCKLING) Take that, liberal media.</p>
<p>Homer! This says I've won Homemaker Magazine's &quot;Clean for a Day&quot; contest! Mmm.</p>
<p>&quot;A highly k*ll professional will come to your home and clean it top to bottom while you relax.&quot;</p>
<p>But how could I have won?</p>
<p>I don't subscribe to this periodical.</p>
<p>Marge, I don't have to sit here and listen to your insane ravings about me getting other people's mail.</p>
<p>Hi. I'm Brenda Weingarten.</p>
<p>(SCREAMS)</p>
<p>(VACUUM CLEANER WHIRRING)</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: Mom, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Cleaning up before the housekeeper comes.</p>
<p>This is a total stranger who cleans houses for a living.</p>
<p>Who cares what she thinks?</p>
<p>Don't be so naive, Lisa.</p>
<p>Those people all talk to each other.</p>
<p>You know what I found in their dirty clothes hamper?</p>
<p>Dirty clothes!</p>
<p>I found a hair in the drain.</p>
<p>Not a fine upstanding head hair, but a curly-wurly!</p>
<p>(All) (CHANTING) Untidy! Untidy! Untidy!</p>
<p>Untidy! Untidy! Untidy! Mmm-mmm.</p>
<p>Now, this is a house that's ready to be cleaned!</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>(DOORBELL RINGS)</p>
<p>(GASPS) That's her! Don't answer it yet!</p>
<p>I don't want that judgmental bitch in my house!</p>
<p>(GASPS) Maple syrup mixed with baby spit-up and shoe scuff?</p>
<p>This is going to take my whole arsenal at once!</p>
<p>(GRUNTING)</p>
<p>(INHALES DEEPLY)</p>
<p><em>Et tu, Zud?</em></p>
<p>(GASPS) She's opening her eyes!</p>
<p>Oh, my head feels like it was punched by a boxing man.</p>
<p>How many fingers am I holding up?</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>Now I'll put them back in the jar.</p>
<p>Now I have a question.</p>
<p>Who are you people?</p>
<p>She doesn't recognize us!</p>
<p>(ALL GASP)</p>
<p>You monster! What have you done to my face?</p>
<p>When will Marge remember us?</p>
<p>It's hard to say, with retrograde amnesia such as this, the patient could forget years and years of her life.</p>
<p>You just have to keep jogging her memory till it works.</p>
<p>Aw, jogging?</p>
<p>I didn't say you should be jogging.</p>
<p>Sweet.</p>
<p>Although you should be jogging.</p>
<p>On, jogging?</p>
<p>Marge, I'm gonna take care of you until your amnesia goes scram-nesia.</p>
<p>I got you flowers...</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>...fluffy pillow, and a nice, relaxing private room.</p>
<p>(SNORING)</p>
<p>Oh, you're sweet.</p>
<p>I'm lucky to have such a kind, uh... Uncle?</p>
<p>I'm your husband!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I am. We're the same age.</p>
<p>But you're so much more ravaged than I am.</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>I do eat a lot of crap.</p>
<p>I'm Lisa.</p>
<p>I'm eight years old, and this might sound presumptuous, but I'm your favorite.</p>
<p>Oh, you seem sweet, but I could never have a favorite.</p>
<p>Well, talk to me in a week.</p>
<p>Hi. I'm Bart.</p>
<p>I'm 10 years old and a professional motocross jumper.</p>
<p>Can you buy me a motocross bike?</p>
<p>I may have lost my memory, but I'm not an idiot.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>Great news, Marge, we're going home.</p>
<p>Yes, the insurance company said you're as well as they're gonna pay for.</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Oh, I can't wait to see what kind of home we live in.</p>
<p>Oh, it's great.</p>
<p>Like somebody barfed a two-story pile of puke.</p>
<p>Why, you little...</p>
<p>(CHOKING)</p>
<p>(GRUNTING)</p>
<p>You strangle your child?</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING) Yeah, but he's cool with it.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>(SWALLOWS)</p>
<p>It hurts when I swallow.</p>
<p>Why, you little...</p>
<p>(GRUNTING)</p>
<p>(CHOKING)</p>
<p>Mmm...</p>
<p>Now, the doctor said a tour of the town could help bring back your memory.</p>
<p>I say Bing cherries are the most delicious!</p>
<p>I say maraschino!</p>
<p>(BOTH GRUNTING)</p>
<p>Who are those freaks?</p>
<p>(LAUGHING) Those &quot;freaks,&quot; as you call them, are some of our closest friends.</p>
<p>Maraschino isn't even a kind of cherry!</p>
<p>It's a way of preserving them!</p>
<p>Sounds like Duffman took the wrong side in this chicken fight.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah!</p>
<p>(BRAKES SCREECH)</p>
<p>Why is that drug addict driving a school bus?</p>
<p>Whoa, I may be wasted, but I still care about the safety of these kids.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Hmm... Hmm...</p>
<p>See that ball of fire?</p>
<p>That's the sun.</p>
<p>It goes by many names.</p>
<p>Apollo's Lantern, day-moon, Old Blazey.</p>
<p>The important thing is never to touch it.</p>
<p>I know what the sun is!</p>
<p>Yes, now you do.</p>
<p>(PACIFIER SQUEAKING)</p>
<p>I know that sound!</p>
<p>Maggie! My sweet little angel!</p>
<p>Mmm... Mmm!</p>
<p>The sound of the baby must have triggered a primal mnemonic response in Mom's brain!</p>
<p>Lisa! My little know-it-all!</p>
<p>Hey, guys, guess who just became lactose-tolerant?</p>
<p>Milhouse! You're Bart's best friend!</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>I remember Bart!</p>
<p>Oh, I can't believe you remembered me through Milhouse.</p>
<p>He's not even my best friend.</p>
<p>Who's got amnesia now, Bart?</p>
<p>Mmm, mmm, mmm.</p>
<p>It's so great to have my children back.</p>
<p>I better get ready. I'm next.</p>

<p>All right, Marge, time to remember Admiral Awesome!</p>
<p>Mmm...</p>
<p>Nope. I'm sorry, Admiral, but you're still a stranger to me.</p>
<p>Oh. Why do you remember them and not me?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Maybe there's something unpleasant blocking my memory of you.</p>
<p>Hi-diddly-ho, Simpsons!</p>
<p>Oh, hey, Ned. Isn't today your cat's birthday?</p>
<p>I remember, 'cause she shares the date with Patti LaBelle.</p>
<p>(GROANS LOUDLY)</p>
<p>Okay. All it'll take to unlock your memories of me is one of these blasts from the past.</p>
<p>Here's me fighting with former President Bush.</p>
<p>Me fighting with current President Bush.</p>
<p>And here's me showing a bag of apples who's boss.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>You seem like a colorful character, but I just don't remember you.</p>
<p>Well, maybe if we snuggle, it might rattle some memories loose.</p>
<p>What's &quot;snuggling&quot;?</p>
<p>When a man and a woman love each other very much, they usually get together...</p>
<p>Mr. Simpson, I don't even know you!</p>
<p>I'm not making love with you!</p>
<p>But what if we...</p>
<p>(INAUDIBLE)</p>
<p>You're describing how to parallel park.</p>
<p>(SOBBING)</p>
<p>You used to love my non sequiturs.</p>
<p>(SOBBING CONTINUES)</p>
<p>Why can I remember everyone in town except my husband?</p>
<p>Simple. Your brain is trying to save you from your backed-up toilet of a marriage.</p>
<p>Have you been talking like this for my entire marriage?</p>
<p>Oh, no. No.</p>
<p>We've always honored your choice.</p>
<p>I don't know. I should give Homer a chance.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, I feel nothing for him.</p>
<p>(BOTH LAUGHING)</p>
<p>(GASPS) This is horrible!</p>
<p>We've got to tell Dad.</p>
<p>Oh, no! Bart and Lisa are gonna tell me something horrible!</p>
<p>(SIGHS) What?</p>
<p>&quot;Buy the police department a hang glider,&quot; you said.</p>
<p>&quot;Fight crime from above,&quot; you said.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you said you're only 180 pounds.</p>
<p>Shut up and look for crime.</p>
<p>(DOORBELL RINGS)</p>
<p>Mr. Simpson?</p>
<p>Marge, if I can't make you remember me, then I'll make you fall for me all over again.</p>
<p>The heart is the symbol for love.</p>
<p>Uh!</p>
<p>(BOTH LAUGHING)</p>
<p>(SINGING) <em>That Homer Simpson, he's quite a guy.</p>
<p>He paid me 10 bucks so I would lie.</p>
<p>The truth is he's not so great.</p>
<p>He is the one man I truly hate</em></p>
<p>So beautiful.</p>
<p>I wish I could understand ltalian.</p>
<p>I've had a lovely evening, Mr. Simpson.</p>
<p>Just wait, we're coming to the site of our most romantic night ever.</p>
<p>It was the plywood castle that we first...</p>
<p>Well, you know.</p>
<p>Know what?</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>No! I'm not the kind of girl who makes love on a putt-putt golf course!</p>
<p>Oh, you loved it, especially when the windmill came around and whacked your butt.</p>
<p>(PURRING)</p>
<p>Oh, that sounds horrible!</p>
<p>No. It was the happiest night of my life.</p>
<p>The warm spring air, the swings I took in the batting cage afterwards.</p>
<p>Don't you remember, darling?</p>
<p>No, and I hope I never do!</p>
<p>The best thing that ever happened to me was forgetting about you!</p>
<p>(GRUNTING)</p>
<p>You know, I still think about you all the time.</p>
<p>Birthdays over, Seymour.</p>
<p>But, uh...</p>
<p>I'm sorry you have to leave, but I just can't think of another way.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Wait, I thought of another way. I stay.</p>
<p>Goodbye, Mr. Simpson.</p>
<p>Uh!</p>
<p>Dad, we don't want you to leave.</p>
<p>(SOBS) My grades will suffer.</p>
<p>In fact, they're already suffering.</p>
<p>Look at this garden of &quot;Fs.&quot; You planted them all.</p>
<p>Marge, I realize you've made up your mind, and I want you to know that I deeply respect your...</p>
<p>Boo! That works for hiccups, not amnesia.</p>
<p>I know. I just thought maybe...</p>
<p>Boo!</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>Boo.</p>
<p>(COUGHING)</p>
<p>How long you gonna be bunking with me, son?</p>
<p>Well, the rest of your life for sure.</p>
<p>Why are we having dinner in Shelbyville?</p>
<p>We found a place here that's serving up just what you need.</p>
<p>A mixer? I don't know.</p>
<p>I am still technically married.</p>
<p>All we're saying is go in and chat with these guys.</p>
<p>And if you want a quickie annulment and remarriage, we've got all the paperwork right here.</p>
<p>Why don't you sign a bunch now?</p>
<p>For fun.</p>
<p>Welcome to speed dating, you exciting, lonely people.</p>
<p>Every five minutes, I'm going to blow this horn...</p>
<p>(AIR HORN BLOWS)</p>
<p>...and each man will move one table to his left.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Is this how you met your husband?</p>
<p>No, I met him through friends like a normal person.</p>
<p>Now, speed date.</p>
<p>(AIR HORN BLOWS)</p>
<p>(STAMMERING) I want you to know I'm coming from a very fragile place.</p>
<p>My wife left me...</p>
<p>(SOBS)</p>
<p>...five years ago.</p>
<p>Oh, that's so sad.</p>
<p>Why did I k*ll her, why?</p>
<p>(AIR HORN BLOWS)</p>
<p>Hello there.</p>
<p>Yeah, hi. How you doing?</p>
<p>So, uh, let's get right to it.</p>
<p>I don't drive a Lexus, okay?</p>
<p>I don't have a Learjet or some big beach house in la-la land.</p>
<p>I am just a nice man who makes a decent living.</p>
<p>So I guess I should probably just go sh**t myself, huh?</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Oh, don't get quiet on me.</p>
<p>Please, I hate when they get quiet.</p>
<p>(AIR HORN BLOWS)</p>
<p>Ta-da!</p>
<p>I know what you're thinking, but don't worry, I'm old enough to date.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING)</p>
<p>(WHISPERING) Dermabrasion!</p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: <em>I think he's a male gay.</em></p>
<p>(AIR HORN BLOWS) Ah!</p>
<p>I have to admit something, I feel a little silly.</p>
<p>Oh, me, too.</p>
<p>I can't believe anyone ever really finds anyone at these things.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was dragged here by my older brothers.</p>
<p>We used to be quintuplets, but three of us drowned.</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>I really know where you're coming from.</p>
<p>(AIR HORN BLOWS)</p>
<p>Oh, I guess we have to move on.</p>
<p>Do we? We're adults. Why don't we just go get a cup of coffee?</p>
<p>I'd love to.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING)</p>
<p>Ooh-la-la.</p>
<p>I smell romance.</p>
<p>It's a perfect night for love.</p>
<p>Would you pretty ladies care to join us for some champagne?</p>
<p>Go suck a rat, Assanova.</p>
<p>(CLOCK TICKING)</p>
<p>(PHONE RINGING)</p>
<p>(GASPS) That might be Marge!</p>
<p>Don't answer it. Savor the sound.</p>
<p>(CONTINUES RINGING) Oh, boy...</p>
<p>Marge?</p>
<p>Homer, I don't want to alarm you, but right now we're looking at your wife yukkin' it up with a good-looking guy.</p>
<p>He just touched her arm and now they're being quiet.</p>
<p>But it's not an awkward silence.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's more like a &quot;nothing needs to be said&quot; kind of silence.</p>
<p>(SCREAMS)</p>
<p>I just think the best thing a person can do for the world is to be clean and polite.</p>
<p>Wow, that's what I would have said.</p>
<p>Well, I would have said, &quot;Polite and clean,&quot; but wow, still.</p>
<p>Oh, no! He's Marge's, and my, dream man.</p>
<p>I've got to make a play for her now Or I might lose her forever.</p>
<p>Uh!</p>
<p>(SPITS) D'oh!</p>
<p>At least she found someone who can make her happy.</p>
<p>Oh, Marge, I feel like the two of us can say anything to each other.</p>
<p>You really mean that? I do.</p>
<p>I've got amnesia and I have three kids.</p>
<p>Wow. My first thought is &quot;respect,&quot; both for your mental illness and your ability to get back into shape.</p>
<p>My second thought is &quot;goodbye.&quot;</p>
<p>You idiot! Ah!</p>
<p>Do you know what you just gave up?</p>
<p>Who the hell are you?</p>
<p>The wisest, wettest man you'll ever meet.</p>
<p>Go on. You just walked away from the sweetest, most beautiful woman a guy could want.</p>
<p>In 10 years, she never had the last slice of pizza and she's never complained.</p>
<p>Every election, she wishes she could vote for both guys because they both seem nice.</p>
<p>And there's alight inside her that makes everyone else look better.</p>
<p>And you blew her off.</p>
<p>Dude, she's got three kids.</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>Really? Well, she's still great.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: Mr. Simpson.</p>
<p>I may not know much about you, but you sure know a lot of wonderful things about me.</p>
<p>And that means a lot to a woman.</p>
<p>I still don't remember you.</p>
<p>But for the first time since this happened, I wish I did, Homer.</p>
<p>I'm so happy we're together again. Want to get a drink?</p>
<p>You drink?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, I started when you were in the hospital.</p>
<p>Oh, I was so worried.</p>
<p>Recently I tried this thing called beer, and...</p>
<p>(GASPS) I remember everything!</p>
<p>You get drunk all the time.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>But do you also remember that you're an enabler?</p>
<p>Oh, of course I do.</p>
<p>That's why we're such a great team.</p>
<p>(TIRES SQUEALING)</p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: You've been drinking today, haven't you?</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: I sure have, partner.</p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: <em>I remember him.</em></p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: <em>What about her? </em></p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: <em>No, I don't know.</p>
<p>And her? Oh, and her.</p>
<p>And her'! Uh-huh. And him.</p>
<p>Well, what about him?</p>
<p>Mmm, I don't recognize that name.</p>
<p>Yeah. I have their baseball cards.</p>
<p>Oh, I know all them.</p>
<p>Look at all those people. You know them?</p>
<p>Wow. She still works here?</p>
<p>Yeah, she's over in post now.</p>
<p>Oh, I always liked that guy.</em></p>
<p>Not me.</p>
<p><em>But we can't get rid of him because he's friends with Richard Sakai.</p>
<p>Oh, and there's a familiar name. And another one. Wait.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to that guy from the network?</p>
<p>Did he get married?</p>
<p>Oh, he ain't getting married.</em></p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p><em>He has commitment issues.</em></p>
