<p>Hello, friend-o.   </p>
<p>No, no! You promised you would cut this scene.   </p>
<p>No, no, I cut your scene because you were such a noodge.   </p>
<p>- Forget it. Show's over!<br />
- Woo-hoo!   </p>
<p>Ugh, fine.   </p>
<p>Can I please get back my after-show cupcakes?   </p>
<p>- We already ate them.<br />

<p>Homer, that's the weather.   </p>
<p>HOMER: D'oh!   </p>
<p>Homer, I want you to do something with Lisa.   </p>
<p>I am.   </p>
<p>Isn't that right, honey? Oops.   </p>
<p>You're not speaking to her or even making eye contact.   </p>
<p>Oh, you'd be surprised at the things my eyes are in contact with.   </p>
<p>Okay. Well, what is she doing right now?   </p>
<p>Uh, uh... she's riding her pony?   </p>
<p>Uh, uh... blowing her clarinet?   </p>
<p>Ooh, ooh, ooh! Protesting a whale.   </p>
<p>I'm reading <em>To k*ll a Mockingbird.</em>   </p>
<p>Now just remember, it's set in the South a long time ago.   </p>
<p>The terrible racism you're reading about is now everywhere.   </p>
<p>We're gonna shop at all the stores you like that have a chair I can sit in, except the chair store.   </p>
<p>I'm not allowed back there.   </p>
<p>Kent Brockman here interviewing three blue-collar men who voted for Trump.<br />
How do you feel now?   </p>
<p>- Please stop interviewing us.<br />
- Never.   </p>
<p>Here's the store.   </p>
<p>Let's get something sweet for my little girl.   </p>
<p>Sugar and spice and everything... What the?!   </p>
<p>&quot;Twerking Girl&quot;?   </p>
<p>&quot;Ho, Sweet Ho&quot;? &quot;Baby's First Thong&quot;?   </p>

<p>HOMER: Oh, for crying out loud.   </p>
<p>Okay, that's it. I've heard enough and three past that.   </p>
<p>My daughter is still a sweet little girl.   </p>
<p>What the? Oh, come on!   </p>
<p>My daughter's not a sex object.<br />
She's a respect object.   </p>
<p>Innocent girls.   </p>
<p>♪   </p>
<p>Knee socks.   </p>

<p>Grow up too fast.   </p>

<p>I will see you all in court.   </p>

<p>Hmm? Mm.   </p>
<p>Dad, I'm seeing you through new eyes.   </p>
<p>You've become the hero of my book.   </p>
<p>The guy who k*ll the mockingbird?    </p>
<p>No one k*ll a mockingbird.    </p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, spoiler alert.    </p>
<p>You're like Atticus Finch, a modest, heroic man who stands up for what's right.    </p>
<p>Uh, yeah, sure.    </p>
<p>And I love the way you just made me feel safer.    </p>
<p>[GASPS] She respects me.    </p>
<p>This is even better than the time the Milk Duds in the vending machine knocked down a   Musketeers bar, too.    </p>
<p>Woo-hoo! Man b*at machine!    </p>
<p>Oh!    </p>
<p>ATTICUS [ON TV]: Well, I think that's all the reading for tonight, honey. It's getting late.    </p>
<p>What time is it?    </p>
<p> :  .    </p>
<p>SCOUT: May I see your watch?    </p>
<p>&quot;To Atticus, My Beloved Husband.&quot;    </p>
<p>Oh, black and white? The TV's broken.    </p>
<p>Hey, we were watching that.    </p>
<p>[SOUTHERN ACCENT]:<br />
Why, look, it's Bart Simpson in his short pants on the davenport.    </p>
<p>Are you nuts?    </p>
<p>Homer is my hero.    </p>
<p>Say it in American.    </p>
<p>[NORMAL VOICE]: He stood up for me.    </p>
<p>It was magnificent.    </p>
<p>- I wish my dad was a hero.<br />
- Wish granted, son!    </p>
<p>Now let's move it.    </p>
<p>If I hand out  ,    flyers, I get all the turkey shreds I can dig out of the slicer trap.    </p>
<p>And dig I will. [CHUCKLES]    </p>
<p>Well, I don't care if Dad's your hero.    </p>
<p>You know whose hero I am?<br />
Maggie's. Come here, girl.    </p>
<p>Okay, the dog's your hero, but I'm your human hero.    </p>
<p>Fine.    </p>
<p>But I'm your living human hero.    </p>
<p>Are you saying I'm dead?<br />
Put up your dukes.    </p>
<p>Now put up my dukes.    </p>
<p>Now take down your dukes. [GRUNTS]    </p>
<p>I'm the greatest!    </p>
<p>Oh... someone put down my dukes.    </p>
<p>♪    </p>
<p>LISA: <em>I'd always liked my dad,</em><em>but this was something new and wonderful.</em>    </p>
<p><em>I admired him.</em>    </p>
<p><em>The way he'd take me to the science museum once a year.</em>    </p>
<p>D'oh!    </p>
<p>D'oh!    </p>
<p>And now we get ice cream.    </p>
<p>- Hmm.<br />
- Mmm.    </p>
<p>Oh, sweetie, it's starting to melt.    </p>
<p>Daddy will give you a little help.    </p>
<p>A little more help.    </p>
<p>A little more. A little more.    </p>
<p>Oops. Oh, Daddy ate yours.<br />
You can have mine.    </p>
<p>- Thank you.<br />
- Now let Daddy...    </p>
<p>I got it.    </p>
<p><em>And he inspired me in school.</em>    </p>
<p>The second grade was grim, but Jem assured me that the older I get, the better school would be.    </p>
<p>Who says my class is grim? Who's Jem?    </p>
<p>What are you talking about?    </p>
<p>That's from <em>To k*ll a Mockingbird.</em>    </p>
<p>Page   . The book you assigned us to read.    </p>
<p>I assigned you to read the Wikipedia article.    </p>
<p>LISA: <em>But my brother was not so happy.</em>    </p>
<p>Mom, why can't we be like that?    </p>
<p>[LISA AND HOMER LAUGHING]    </p>
<p>Well...    </p>
<p>[HUMMING]    </p>
<p>[SPITS] I taste blue.    </p>
<p>Yeah, okay.    </p>
<p>- [HACKS]<br />
- [GROANS]    </p>
<p>I tell you, guys, having a kid that likes you is the greatest feeling in the world.    </p>
<p>I never got along with my old man.    </p>
<p>He was always disappointed I didn't follow him in the family business.    </p>
<p>- What did he do?<br />
- He was editor of<em> Life</em> magazine.    </p>
<p>- I thought that was defunct.<br />
- Eh, he keeps saying a real son would've bought it out of bankruptcy and launched it as a digital platform.    </p>
<p>Well, angel funders want too much equity.    </p>
<p>Sorry, Dad.    </p>
<p>[SIGHS] Yeah, my dad left when I was most vulnerable, the day after Mom left.<br />
That was a tough week there.    </p>
<p>[CRYING]    </p>
<p>Not a good time to film a commercial.    </p>
<p>Don't worry, we'll take these cameras and we'll make a Netflix documentary.    </p>
<p>They will buy anything!    </p>
<p><em>[MARGE HUMMING]</em>    </p>
<p>For dessert, I made blackberry pie.    </p>
<p>Oh, I made Dad a blueberry pie.    </p>
<p>Oh, what to do, what to do?    </p>
<p>In the words of King Solomon, I shall eat two pies.    </p>
<p>I don't think King Solomon said that.    </p>
<p>Maybe it was a king salmon.    </p>
<p>The point is, pies are good.    </p>
<p>Homer, I think Bart could use a little attention.    </p>
<p>[SIGHS] Give attention to Lisa, give attention to Bart.    </p>
<p>What am I, made of attention?    </p>
<p>Okay, because of budget cutbacks, you got    seconds each.    </p>
<p>   after the explanation. You, get in!    </p>
<p>What you're experiencing is a phenomenon known as transference, where you project your feelings towards your mother onto your art teacher.    </p>
<p>Anytime you find yourself wanting to hug Mrs. Hakamuchi,    </p>
<p>- snap this rubber band on your wrist.<br />
- Ow.    </p>
<p>- [TIMER DINGS]<br />
- Next!    </p>
<p>What are you waiting for?<br />
I'm here for an hour, then I'm off to    other schools.    </p>
<p>I eat lunch in my car 'cause they won't let me counsel kids with food in my mouth.    </p>
<p>Well, I always thought my dad was a big fat loser until he started giving attention to my lame-o sister.    </p>
<p>So why do I want his attention now?    </p>
<p>Why does this hurt?    </p>
<p>Family members are locked into roles. Change that, and what do you get?    </p>
<p>Resentment and acting out.<br />
Acting out can take many forms, from pouting to armed robbery.    </p>
<p>- Time's almost up.<br />
- So, what do I do?    </p>
<p>You have no choice.    </p>
<p>Act out until somebody pays attention to you.    </p>
<p>- [TIMER DINGS]<br />
- Next!    </p>
<p>Okay, couples therapy.<br />
You got    seconds.    </p>
<p>BOTH: I'm the oldest, and she won't admit it.    </p>
<p>Milhouse, I'm about to act out.    </p>
<p>After we leave an envelope full of guilt.    </p>
<p>Also, we're stopping by the photo booth    </p>
<p>- and the perfume room.<br />
- Enough.    </p>

<p>Before you leave, I am going to talk.    </p>
<p>And I'm going to tell you a very long joke.    </p>
<p>Please stand.    </p>
<p>So, an old rabbi was confronted with squirrels in the attic.    </p>
<p>Get to the punch line or your son flunks geometry.    </p>
<p>He gave the squirrels a bar mitzvah and never saw them in temple again.    </p>
<p>Amen.    </p>

<p>[SOUTHERN ACCENT]: Excuse me, Mr. Szyslak.    </p>
<p>Mr. Szyslak, we know you.    </p>
<p>My father likes to drink at your bar.    </p>
<p>You can't say hi to me?    </p>
<p>[SOBBING]    </p>
<p>And how 'bout you, Chief Wiggum?    </p>
<p>I go to school with your boy, Ralph.    </p>
<p>Give my regards to Ralph, would you, please?    </p>
<p>All right, let's go, people.<br />
They've defused us.    </p>
<p>Everyone get, uh, get one last mutter in.    </p>
<p>[ALL MUTTERING]    </p>
<p>Oh, Lisa, sweetie, you saved me.    </p>
<p>No, Dad, you saved us all with your calmness and bravery.    </p>
<p>- Thanks. Just one thing.<br />
- Yes, Dad?    </p>
<p>Don't tell your mother about the mob that almost k*ll your brother.    </p>
<p>She's taken a liking to him.    </p>
<p>MARGE: The what?    </p>
<p>You're hearing things in the shower again, Marge.    </p>
<p>Oh, okay.    </p>
<p>- [g*n]<br />
- WIGGUM: Sorry.    </p>
<p>Okay, Maggie, you give me your binky, and I'll give you this substitution bear doll.    </p>
<p>You can't b*at addiction, Marge.    </p>
<p>I got addicted to Agatha Christie books.    </p>
<p>I always thought the m*rder was that know-it-all Belgian.    </p>
<p>Turns out, he was the detective.    </p>
<p>   books, and I never saw it coming.    </p>
<p>- [LISA GROANS]<br />
- [GASPS]    </p>
<p>- What happened?<br />
- Got in a fight.    </p>
<p>Why? What did the other kid do?    </p>
<p>Said Dad was lazy and incompetent.    </p>
<p>And where is this other kid?    </p>
<p>- Yo.<br />
- [GASPS]    </p>
<p>You got in a fight with your brother?    </p>
<p>I<em> won</em> a fight with my brother.    </p>
<p>- Liar.<br />
- Let's go again.    </p>
<p>Stop her, Mom.    </p>
<p>[MARGE GROANS]    </p>
<p>To combat bed-wetting, doctors recommend shifting times for drinking, scheduling bathroom breaks, and being encouraging.<br />
I'll deny having said this, but the next time you wet your bed, have 'em spank you.    </p>
<p>- Next.<br />
- [TIMER DINGS]    </p>
<p>Wait, you're not a kid. Doesn't matter.    </p>
<p>You've got    seconds. Go.    </p>
<p>I'm worried that my daughter is ruining her family idolizing her father.    </p>
<p>I see. Wow. Marge, it's totally normal for a little girl to be infatuated with her father.    </p>
<p>It's safe and comes from a good place, and when it ends, it's another thing she'll blame you for.    </p>
<p>Yes, well, I'm afraid my husband isn't always a perfect influence.    </p>
<p>Marge, I've got a legal matter to deal with.    </p>
<p>I'll be outside.    </p>
<p>Also, I'm worried that my son is feeling neglected.    </p>
<p>Your husband has to give your daughter the perfect speech, which lets her down but doesn't snap her in two.    </p>
<p>And make sure you don't have any more kids.    </p>
<p>Sounds like it'll be a disaster.    </p>
<p>Whoa, nice to meet you.<br />
See you in three years.    </p>
<p>- [TIMER DINGS]<br />
- Now, good-bye.    </p>
<p>- Homer?<br />
- Huh? What?    </p>
<p>Homer, it's sweet that Lisa idolizes you,    </p>
<p>but I think it's gone too far.    </p>
<p>You're right.    </p>
<p><em>Tell her she's right.</em>    </p>
<p>I just did.    </p>
<p><em>I'm on a five-second delay.</em>    </p>
<p>The kids are at each other's throats.    </p>
<p>Look, you can't be my dog and hers; pick a side.    </p>
<p>You can't hide in there forever.    </p>
<p>- [TOOTS]<br />
- [BARKING]    </p>
<p>Okay, I'll talk to Bart, you talk to Lisa.    </p>
<p>We've got to put this family back in place.    </p>
<p>Okay. Why do you always tell me the most important things just when I'm about to fall asleep?    </p>
<p>Because I think the pillow talk between a woman and her husband is the most important...    </p>
<p>What? How did I wind up in church?    </p>
<p>What's wrong, sweetie?    </p>
<p>I've got that terrible feeling where I'm almost at the end of a great book, and once I finish, it's over forever.    </p>
<p>Well, that's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about.    </p>
<p>You and I have had a lot of fun these past few weeks, but you aren't always gonna look up to your dad as much as you do now.    </p>
<p>Bup, bup, bup. Great man, there is nothing you could do to make me lose one iota of respect for you.    </p>
<p>♪    </p>
<p>When I was a kid, I wanted to be that guy, but now I can't fit behind a door.    </p>
<p>You'll discover I'm not the perfect man you think.    </p>
<p>Okay, I'll finish my book.    </p>
<p>But always remember you're my dad, and I'll never forget the way you and...    </p>
<p>Damn it.    </p>
<p>I'm home!    </p>
<p>[SIGHS]    </p>
<p><em>She's moved on,</em> <em>which, let's face it, is the way things should be.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Kids grow up, daddies die,</em><em>and then the wind whispers, &quot;Why?&quot;</em>    </p>
<p>Oh, I don't know. I've been hurt before.    </p>
<p>I don't want to mess you up by getting close to you.    </p>
<p>Aw.    </p>
<p>No problem.    </p>
<p>Marge, get in here.    </p>
<p>Okay Bart, because we treasure you too, I'm gonna let you do one thing just for yourself.    </p>
<p>Kick Homer in the butt?    </p>
<p>Uh, why don't you give it some thought.    </p>
<p>Kick Lisa in the butt. Have a birthday party every day?    </p>
<p>Never brush my teeth again.    </p>
<p>Be homeschooled by the dog.    </p>
<p>Drive a t*nk through Skinner's house.    </p>
<p>Open a casino in the basement.    </p>
<p>Have an affair?    </p>
<p>- You haven't decided yet?<br />
- Don't rush me.    </p>
<p>Convert my Roth IRA to a    K?    </p>
<p>Have an affair?    </p>
<p>Take a mulligan?    </p>
<p>Okay, I've decided.    </p>
<p>I'll kick Homer in the butt.    </p>
<p>You can kick it if you can find it.    </p>
<p>D'oh.    </p>
