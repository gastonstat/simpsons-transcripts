							<p>BART'S GIRLFRIEND</p>
<p>Remember, Bart... I mean, Dances in Underwear.</p>
<p>We take the white man alive.</p>
<p>All right, Thinks Too Much. It shall be so.</p>
<p>Keep your eyes peeled for Injuns. I mean, Native Americans.</p>
<p>They're after us because we gave them blankets infected with cooties.</p>
<p>I ate all my caps.</p>
<p>Throw down your w*apon and kiss the prairie, cow dorks!</p>
<p>Why do we have to play this corny old game anyway?</p>
<p>I brought my jacks!</p>
<p>I got twosies!</p>
<p>That's not fair, Nelson. They didn't have the k*ll 3000 back then.</p>
<p>Hey, records from that era are spotty at best.</p>
<p>Bart! Lisa! Time for church!</p>
<p>Milhouse, time for church!</p>
<p>Shlomo, time for your violin lesson!</p>
<p>Why the crap do we have to go church anyway?</p>
<p>You just answered your own question with that commode mouth.</p>
<p>Besides, you kids need to learn morals and decency... and how to love your fellow man.</p>
<p>And with flaming swords, the Aramites did pierce the eyes of their fellow men... and did feast on what flowed forth.</p>
<p>Among whom also we all once conducted ourselves... in the lusts of our flesh...</p>
<p>I'm a troll man.</p>
<p>I'm a troll man.</p>
<p>I don't want you playing with something that has such bizarre hair.</p>
<p>Awful, awful hair.</p>
<p>And now my daughter, Jessica... who has just returned from boarding school... will read the same passage I just read.</p>
<p>I noticed a few of you weren't paying attention.</p>
<p>Wow, there is a God.</p>
<p>I'm telling you, the light would work better if it pointed out to sea!</p>
<p>Shut up, I know what I'm doing.</p>
<p>I hate the sea and everything in it.</p>
<p>Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Thank you for choosing our church.</p>
<p>I've never felt this way about a girl before.</p>
<p>My long search is finally over.</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Bart Simpson.</p>
<p>I was incredibly moved by your reading.</p>
<p>I don't think God's words have ever sounded so plausible.</p>
<p>Thanks, Art.</p>
<p>I have to go over here now.</p>
<p>Don't be so hard on yourself, Bart.</p>
<p>It's not your fault Jessica doesn't like you.</p>
<p>Is it my hair? My overbite?</p>
<p>The fact that I've worn the same clothes for the last four years?</p>
<p>No, Bart. I just think you and Jessica are too different to get along.</p>
<p>She's a sweet, kind reverend's daughter, and you're the devil's cabana boy.</p>
<p>Good. Very good.</p>
<p>Ralph, Jesus did not have wheels.</p>
<p>Bart Simpson?</p>
<p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
<p>I'd like to return to your wonderful Sunday school, please.</p>
<p>But, Bart, we banned you from Sunday school.</p>
<p>You were happy. We were happy. Everybody was happy.</p>
<p>Particularly the hamster.</p>
<p>I've changed my ways.</p>
<p>Please give me another chance, ma'am.</p>
<p>All right, Bart. The Bible does teach forgiveness.</p>
<p>Class, I want you to welcome back our prodigal son.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What's prodigal mean?</p>
<p>Oh, dear.</p>
<p>You know, the great thing about Sunday school... is we're finally learning something we can use.</p>
<p>Yeah, so true.</p>
<p>I have to turn my chair this way now.</p>
<p>Somehow I gotta convince her I'm a good person.</p>
<p>All right, I have to sit here and behave, no matter what.</p>
<p>Okay, class. We have a special treat today for pass-around.</p>
<p>A replica of the slingshot David used to slay Goliath.</p>
<p>While you kids are looking at that, I'll just busy myself in this file cabinet.</p>
<p>Must fight Satan.</p>
<p>Make it up to him... later.</p>
<p>You know, I was considering staying after school... and helping teacher clean up.</p>
<p>Do you ever think anything you don't say?</p>
<p>There is just no pleasing a girl like that!</p>
<p>All that unnecessary behaving.</p>
<p>I'm all tense through the chestal area. I need relief.</p>
<p>Now, the kilt was only for day-to-day wear.</p>
<p>In battle, we donned a full-length ball gown covered in sequins.</p>
<p>The idea was to blind your opponent with luxury.</p>
<p>'Tis no more than what God gave me, you Puritan pukes.</p>
<p>That'll hold me, at least till I get my hands on some kind of expl*sives.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Simpson.</p>
<p>You just fell for our sting and won yourself three months' detention.</p>
<p>There's no such thing as Scotchtoberfest!</p>
<p>There's not? You used me, Skinner! You used me!</p>
<p>Three months?</p>
<p>Hi, Bart.</p>
<p>I saw the way they set you up. That was really unfair.</p>
<p>Wanna have dinner at my house tonight?</p>
<p>Really? Sure.</p>
<p>Great. We eat at 7.</p>
<p>There's only one thing to do at a moment like this: Strut.</p>
<p>I can't believe my little boy is already going on his first date.</p>
<p>Oh, that's sweet, Homer. Our son is growing up, isn't he?</p>
<p>No, it's not that. Didn't you hear?</p>
<p>They have no bananas. They have no bananas today.</p>
<p>So, Bart, how's school going? Jessica always gets straight A's.</p>
<p>Well, in my family, grades aren't that important.</p>
<p>It's what you learn that counts.</p>
<p>Six times five! What is it?</p>
<p>Actually, numbers don't have much use in my future career: Olympic gold-medal rocket-sled champ!</p>
<p>I didn't know the rocket sled was an Olympic event.</p>
<p>Well, no offense, but what you don't know could fill a warehouse.</p>
<p>Young man, explain yourself!</p>
<p>Sorry. I have kind of a short fuse, which some find charming.</p>
<p>Speaking of charming, watching Fox last night... I heard a rather amusing story.</p>
<p>This character named Martin was feeling rather randy... and he was heard to remark...</p>
<p>And don't you ever come near my daughter again!</p>
<p>Never have I heard such gratuitous use of the word &quot;butt&quot;!</p>
<p>But... But... But...</p>
<p>Make him stop!</p>
<p>But... But... But...</p>
<p>Make him stop!</p>
<p>You're bad, Bart Simpson.</p>
<p>No, I'm not. I'm really...</p>
<p>Yes, you are. You're bad. And I like it.</p>
<p>I'm bad to the bone, honey.</p>
<p>Let's go find some fun.</p>
<p>But your father said...</p>
<p>I told the rev I was going to my room to say my prayers.</p>
<p>Smart, beautiful and a liar.</p>
<p>So much better than that Sarah, plain and tall.</p>
<p>Right there! Put that there!</p>
<p>Excellent! You're incredible, Jessica.</p>
<p>Your throws, your catches, your spirals, your loops.</p>
<p>It's like the toilet paper is an extension of your body.</p>
<p>No way would a minister's daughter go out with you.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? I'll prove it.</p>
<p>Hey, Jessica.</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>Am I supposed to know you?</p>
<p>Jessica, we just...</p>
<p>That's for besmirching an innocent girl's name.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Bart.</p>
<p>You know my parents can't find out about us.</p>
<p>And besides, if it's secret, it's even more exciting.</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>Hey, you wanna go skateboarding?</p>
<p>Actually, I was hoping I could sit down for just a second.</p>
<p>Come on, it'll be fun.</p>
<p>Now I have the energy to do anything.</p>
<p>Just give me two minutes.</p>
<p>Jessica, I think this is too steep.</p>
<p>Bart, you can't trust your perception at this altitude.</p>
<p>Actually, if the road surface maintains its integrity... I just might be able to hold on.</p>
<p>The glue will slow me down.</p>
<p>Any glue leaking?</p>
<p>No. That glue ain't going nowhere.</p>
<p>Nothing's ever gonna stop me.</p>
<p>Oh, no. There goes the glue after all.</p>
<p>Fun, huh?</p>
<p>Have you noticed any change in Bart?</p>
<p>New glasses?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>He looks like something might be disturbing him.</p>
<p>Probably misses his old glasses.</p>
<p>I guess we could get more involved in Bart's activities.</p>
<p>But then I'd be afraid of smothering him.</p>
<p>Yeah. And then we'd get the chair.</p>
<p>That's not what I meant.</p>
<p>It was, Marge. Admit it.</p>

<p><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div></p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>We should get to class.</p>
<p>What's the hurry?</p>
<p>We could get in trouble for being late.</p>
<p>You worry too much.</p>
<p>Come on. If you stay here a while, I'll let you hold my hand.</p>
<p>Teamwork! Come on, Bart.</p>
<p>If I don't save the wee turtles, who will?</p>
<p>Save me from the wee turtles! They were too quick for me!</p>
<p>I can't believe it, Bart.</p>
<p>I'd always thought Jessica was so sweet.</p>
<p>She's like a Milk Dud, Lis: Sweet on the outside, poison on the inside.</p>
<p>You gotta give her up.</p>
<p>No, no, wait. Hear my plan.</p>
<p>Put up with her for seven more years.</p>
<p>Then we'll get married.</p>
<p>Once the first baby comes, she's bound to settle down and treat me right.</p>
<p>After all, I deserve it.</p>
<p>Bart, it's naive to think you can change a person.</p>
<p>Except maybe that boy who works in the library.</p>
<p>Do you have Go, Dog, Go?</p>
<p>That's in Juvenile. This is Young Adult.</p>
<p>Well-read and just a little wild.</p>
<p>If only someone could tame him.</p>
<p>You're right, Lisa. Love isn't about fixing someone.</p>
<p>I'm just gonna give her up cold turkey.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna talk to her or see her. It's over.</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice, sis.</p>
<p>There. If I can just get through this many days without seeing her... she should be completely out of my system.</p>
<p>Okay, day one.</p>
<p>Time for church, Bart.</p>
<p>I bet your little friend Jessica will be there.</p>
<p>Jessica.</p>
<p>Bart, be strong.</p>
<p>You don't need that little hellcat.</p>
<p>Oh, Lis, she's already drawn me to her... with her beautiful siren song.</p>
<p>That's very disturbing.</p>
<p>Hey, Bart. What? What's wrong?</p>
<p>Well, Jessica, I don't think we should hang out together anymore.</p>
<p>You're turning me into a criminal when all I want to be is a petty thug.</p>
<p>Oh, good. Here comes the collection plate.</p>
<p>&quot;Thirty cents off Shake 'N' Bake.&quot;</p>
<p>Homer!</p>
<p>We can spare it, Marge.</p>
<p>We've been blessed.</p>
<p>You're right about everything, Bart.</p>
<p>I have been too reckless.</p>
<p>From now on, I am going to settle down.</p>
<p>Jessica, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Well, it takes money to start a new life.</p>
<p>Stealing from the collection basket is really wrong. Even I know that.</p>
<p>Fine. You just lost your cut.</p>
<p>I'll just take that.</p>
<p>Everyone turn around and look at this.</p>
<p>What is it? A Unitarian?</p>
<p>Now just relax. For once, you didn't do anything wrong.</p>
<p>Just explain yourself and everyone will understand.</p>
<p>L...</p>
<p>Took the money? Yes, we know.</p>
<p>He confessed!</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Stop him! He's headed for the window!</p>
<p>Son, if you look me in the eye and say you didn't take the collection money... that's all I need.</p>
<p>I didn't take it.</p>
<p>Why, you little...</p>
<p>How can you lie like that?</p>
<p>Homer, stop that! I believe him.</p>
<p>Tell me, if he didn't take the money, why is he wearing those fancy clothes?</p>
<p>That's what he wore to church.</p>
<p>How convenient.</p>
<p>Bart, honey, do you know who did take the money?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>See, son?</p>
<p>Telling the truth isn't so bad.</p>
<p>Boo!</p>
<p>Boo!</p>
<p>Why, you little...!</p>
<p>Crook!</p>
<p>Thief!</p>
<p>Stealer of money from the church!</p>
<p>We've gotta talk.</p>
<p>Listen, thanks for not turning me in. That was sweet.</p>
<p>Well, it seems like if you really care for me, you should come forward.</p>
<p>Don't you see? It's because I care for you that I can't come forward.</p>
<p>That doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>Then I just don't feel like it, okay?</p>
<p>Jessica, you're really beautiful, but you are not very nice.</p>
<p>With the way you treat me, why should I protect you?</p>
<p>Because if you tell, no one will believe you.</p>
<p>Remember, I'm the sweet, perfect minister's daughter.</p>
<p>And you're just yellow trash.</p>
<p>So here's where you're hiding.</p>
<p>This is my only refuge from the taunts and accusations of the townspeople.</p>
<p>Thief.</p>
<p>Bart, we can't just let her get away with this!</p>
<p>Give it up, Lis. She's a criminal mastermind.</p>
<p>She's got a 108 IQ, she reads at a fifth-grade level.</p>
<p>And her hair smells like red Froot Loops.</p>
<p>Yeah? Well, I eat Froot Loops for breakfast.</p>
<p>Because of last week's problems... we'll be taking certain precautions with this week's collection.</p>
<p>We shouldn't have let them do this. It can't be helping his self-esteem.</p>
<p>Now for our offertory reading, Lisa Simpson... who we'll all be keeping an eye on.</p>
<p>I know most of you have already judged my brother guilty without any proof.</p>
<p>But doesn't the Bible teach us &quot;judge not, lest ye be judged,&quot; Reverend?</p>
<p>I think it may be somewhere towards the back.</p>
<p>There is someone among us with a guilty conscience.</p>
<p>After much soul-searching, I decided it would be wrong of me to name names.</p>
<p>But I urge that guilty person here, under the eyes of God... to come forward, to confess... and save yourself from the torment of your own personal hell!</p>
<p>I smelled some marijuana smoke in Vietnam!</p>
<p>I was the one that canceled Star Trek!</p>
<p>I left my Porsche keys inside Mrs. Glick.</p>
<p>I am talking to the collection-money thief!</p>
<p>Only you can come forward and end this injustice!</p>
<p>Oh, what the heck. It was Jessica Lovejoy!</p>
<p>If you search her room, I am certain you will find the money.</p>
<p>To the little girl's room!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>That's the collection money!</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Smells like church.</p>
<p>I guess it's obvious what's happened here.</p>
<p>Bart Simpson has somehow managed to sneak his bedroom into my house.</p>
<p>Well, come on! Use your imaginations!</p>
<p>No, Dad. I did it.</p>
<p>It's your classic cry for attention.</p>
<p>Well, young lady, I suppose we brought you home... from boarding school a little prematurely.</p>
<p>I was expelled, Dad.</p>
<p>Remember the pipe b*mb? The glee club brawl?</p>
<p>Remember the school chapel collection plate?</p>
<p>The exploding toilets ring a bell? Come on, Dad, pay attention to me!</p>
<p>Hello, in there. Hello?</p>
<p>I think you all owe my son an apology.</p>
<p>Very sorry.</p>
<p>That's okay. Appreciate it.</p>
<p>Hi, Jessica.</p>
<p>Hi, Bart.</p>
<p>Come to watch me suffer?</p>
<p>I just wanted to let you know that even though this was a difficult experience... I really learned a lot.</p>
<p>I'm a little wiser and a little less naive.</p>
<p>Well, I learned that I can make men do whatever I want.</p>
<p>Well, don't you see, Jessica? Then you really haven't learned...</p>
<p>Would you finish scrubbing these steps?</p>
<p>Will I?</p>
<p>Hey, Jessica!</p>
<p>Coming!</p>
<p>Poor sucker. It's amazing what some guys will do for a pretty face.</p>
<p>Not me though.</p>
<p>Wait till she sees the second-rate job I do on these stairs.</p>
