<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Here's your caption, boys. &quot;Local Hero Shuns Spotlight and Pitches in.&quot;</p>
<p>What an angle!</p>
<p>I can't believe I'm spending my Saturday picking up garbage.</p>
<p>I mean, half these bottles ain't even mine.</p>
<p><em>Let's have less conversation and more sanitation.</em></p>
<p>Hey, where's Homer? How'd he get out of this?</p>
<p><em>Hey, everybody.! Up here.!</em></p>
<p>Simpson, stop frolicking and get to work.</p>
<p>Right away, Mr. Smithers.</p>
<p>I'll just walk across these slippery rock-</p>
<p>Oh, no! He's going over the falls!</p>
<p><em>Oh, good. He snagged that tree branch.</em></p>
<p>Oh, no! The branch broke off.</p>
<p><em>Oh, good. He can grab onto them pointy rocks.</em></p>
<p>Oh, no. Them rocks broke his arms and legs!</p>
<p><em>Oh, good. Those helpful beavers are swimming out to save him.</p>
<p>Oh, no. They're biting him and stealing his pants.</p>
<p>Good lord.! He'll be sucked into the turbine.</em></p>
<p>Smithers, who was that corpse?</p>
<p>Homer Simpson, sir.</p>
<p>One of the finest, bravest men ever to grace Sector 7G.</p>
<p>I'll cross him off the list.</p>
<p>That dummy worked like a charm, Dad.</p>
<p>Best 600 bucks I ever spent.</p>
<p>Come on, boy. We've earned this Saturday.</p>
<p>Now let's make the most of it!</p>
<p>Sixty-one. Sixty-two. Sixty-three.</p>
<p><em>Marge, we can't tell you how sorry we are.</em></p>
<p>You have our deepest condol-diddly-olences.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I-I'm just nervous. I didn't mean any disrespect.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>You know. Uh-</p>
<p>Homer's passing.</p>
<p>Away.</p>
<p>Into death.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>That's ridiculous. Homer's not dead. He's right out back in the hammock.</p>
<p>Oh, Marge. Of course Homer's alive.</p>
<p>He's alive in all our hearts.</p>
<p>Yes, Marge. I can see him.</p>
<p>Hi, everybody!</p>
<p>Marge, I'm gonna give you the card of our juvenile counselor.</p>
<p><em>A tombstone?</em></p>
<p>It came with the burial plot. But that's not important.</p>
<p>The important thing is Homer is dead.</p>
<p>We've been saving for this since your wedding day.</p>
<p>Get out of here, you ghouls!</p>
<p><em>Ayayayaya.!</em></p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Uh, excuse me. Sir? I think there's been a mistake.</p>
<p>Oh, no. No mistake.</p>
<p>Your electricity's in the name of HomerJ. Simpson, deceased.</p>
<p>The juice stays off till you get a job or a generator.</p>
<p>Oh, and, uh, my deepest sympathies.</p>
<p>Homer.</p>
<p>That's my name.</p>
<p>When I asked you if that dummy was to fake your own death, you told me no.</p>
<p>You go downtown first thing in the morning and straighten this out.</p>
<p>Mom! Dad! Bart ran into a door frame and bit his tongue!</p>
<p>What the hell is going on here?</p>
<p>Listen here! My name is HomerJ. Simpson!</p>
<p>You guys think I'm dead, but I'm not.</p>
<p>I want you to straighten this out without a lot... of your bureaucratic red tape and mumbo jumbo!</p>
<p>Okay, Mr. Simpson.</p>
<p>I'll just make the change here. And you're all set.</p>
<p>I don't like your attitude, you watercooler dictator.</p>
<p>What do you have in that secret government file anyway? I have a right to read it.</p>
<p>You sure do.</p>
<p>&quot;Wife: Marjorie.</p>
<p><strong>Children</strong>: Bartholomew, Lisa&quot;-</p>
<p>Aha! See? This thing is all screwed up!</p>
<p>Who the heck is Margaret Simpson?</p>
<p>Uh, your youngest daughter.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, your youngest daughter.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, how about this? This thing says my mother's still alive!</p>
<p>She died when I was a kid! See that stone angel up there?</p>
<p>That's my mother's grave!</p>
<p>My dad points it out every time we drive by.</p>
<p>Mr. Simpson, uh, maybe you should actually go up there.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Oh, Mom. I'm sorry I never come to see you.</p>
<p>I'm just not a cemetery person.</p>
<p>&quot;Here lies&quot;-</p>
<p>Walt Whitman?</p>
<p>Damn you, Walt Whitman!</p>
<p>I... hate... you, Walt... freakin'... Whitman!</p>
<p><em>Leaves of Grass my ass!</em></p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Maybe it's that other grave.</p>
<p>The one that says &quot;Simpson.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Why does my death keep coming back to haunt me?</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>You awful, awful man!</p>
<p>Get out of my son's grave!</p>
<p>I hate to rain on your parade, lady.</p>
<p>But this is my grave. Hey-Wait a minute!</p>
<p>Mom?</p>
<p>Homer?</p>
<p><em>I thought you were dead.</p>
<p>I thought you were dead.</em></p>
<p>Well, dang blast it! Isn't anybody in this dad-gummed cemetery dead?</p>
<p>I didn't want to cause a fuss, but now that you mention it.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Homer, you grew up so handsome.</p>
<p>Some people say I look like Dan Aykroyd.</p>
<p>I can't believe you're here.</p>
<p>Dad always told me you died while I was at the movies.</p>
<p>Oh! Oh, my poor baby.</p>
<p>You must've been so upset.</p>
<p>But I suppose Abe had his reasons.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, where have you been all this time?</p>
<p>Oh, it's a very complicated story.</p>
<p>Let's just enjoy this moment.</p>
<p>Mom, there's something you should know about me.</p>
<p>I almost always spoil the moment.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>That's okay, darling.</p>
<p>It wasn't your fault.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody! I got a big surprise for you!</p>
<p>Presenting... my mother!</p>
<p>You're kidding!</p>
<p>That's Grandma Simpson?</p>
<p>Can you believe it?</p>
<p>I thought she was-</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>This is so weird.</p>
<p><em>It's like something out of Dickens. Or Melrose Place.</em></p>
<p>Where have you been, Granny? They freeze you or something?</p>
<p>Oh, my! Such clever grandchildren.</p>
<p>So full of questions and bright, shiny eyes.</p>
<p>I don't know what to say. I finally have a mother-in-law.</p>
<p>No more living vicariously through my girlfriends.</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Since you were a no-show at all the big moments of my life... you owe me years of back presents!</p>
<p>Christmases, birthdays, Easters, Kwanzaas, good report cards.</p>
<p>Hmm, 75 bucks a pop plus interest and penalties.</p>
<p>You owe me... $22,000.</p>
<p><em>I'll Kwanzaa you.!</em></p>
<p>Homer, don't be so hard on little-</p>
<p>What is his name?</p>
<p>This is my room. This is my dresser.</p>
<p>It's where I keep my shirts when I'm not wearing them.</p>
<p>Oh, yes. Right in the drawers.</p>
<p>You remembered.</p>
<p>Oh, I've missed moments like this...</p>
<p>Mom.</p>
<p>I saw all your awards, Lisa. They're mighty impressive.</p>
<p>Aw, I just keep 'em out to bug Bart.</p>
<p>Don't be bashful. When I was your age... kids made fun of me because I read at the ninth-grade level.</p>
<p>Me too!</p>
<p>Hey, Mom!</p>
<p>Look at me! Look at what I can do!</p>
<p>I see you, Homer. That's very nice.</p>
<p><em>Although, I hardly consider A Separate Peace the ninth-grade level.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, more like preschool.</p>
<p>I hate John Knowles.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>Mom, you're not looking!</p>
<p>You know, Lisa, I feel like I have an instant rapport with you.</p>
<p>You didn't dumb it down.</p>
<p>You said &quot;rapport.&quot;</p>
<p>Gotta run! Grandma stuff!</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>There. Now no one should be able to hear us.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>All right. We don't need the dryer.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Just shut up and listen!</p>
<p>There's something fishy about Grandma.</p>
<p>Whenever we ask her where she's been all this time, she changes the subject.</p>
<p>And just now when a police car drove by, she ran into the house.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't trust her either.</p>
<p>I was going through her purse. Look what I found.</p>
<p>&quot;Mona Simpson. Mona Stevens.</p>
<p>&quot;Martha Stewart. Penelope Olsen.</p>
<p>Muddy Mae Suggins?&quot;</p>
<p>These are the calling cards of a con artist.</p>
<p>Woo-hoo! I'm so glad to have my mom back.</p>
<p>I never realized how much I missed her.</p>
<p>She's nice.</p>
<p>But?</p>
<p>I just don't think you should get too excited... about the woman who abandoned you for 25 years.</p>
<p>You could get hurt again.</p>
<p>First, it wasn't 25 years.</p>
<p>It was 27 years. And second, she had a very good reason.</p>
<p>Which was?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I guess I was just a horrible son and no mother would want me.</p>
<p><em>Oh, Homie.</em></p>
<p>Come on! You're a sweet, kind, loving man.</p>
<p>I'm sure you were a wonderful son.</p>
<p>Then why did she leave me?</p>
<p>Let's find out.</p>
<p>Mother Simpson, we'd like to ask you a few questions about your past.</p>
<p>Can't reminisce. Sleeping.</p>
<p>Spill it, Muddy Mae, or we're calling the cops!</p>
<p>Please don't!</p>
<p>All right. Then we'll call your husband.</p>
<p>Grampa!</p>
<p>No! I'll talk!</p>
<p>I'll tell you everything. I've wanted to tell you.</p>
<p>It all started in the '60s.</p>
<p>Take out wrenched ankle.</p>
<p>Mom! Mom!</p>
<p>Mom!</p>

<p>Oh, my little Homie Bear.</p>
<p>Time for bed.</p>
<p>Sing me my bedtime song, Mom.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Darn tootin'!</p>
<p>Here's the tricky part.</p>
<p>Abe, isn't Homer cute?</p>
<p>Probably. I'm trying to watch the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>If people don't support this thing, it might not make it.</p>
<p>Joe Willie Namath swaggering off the field... his sideburns an apogee of sculpted &quot;sartorium&quot;- the foppish follicles pioneered by Ambrose Burnside...</p>
<p>Appomattox, 1865.</p>
<p><em>His wild, untamed facial hair... revealed a new world of rebellion, of change- a world where doors were open for women like me.</p>
<p>But Abe was stuck in his button-down...</p>
<p>Plastic Fantastic Madison Avenue scene.</em></p>
<p>Look at them sideburns! He looks like a girl.</p>
<p>Now, Johnny Unitas- there's a haircut you could set your watch to.</p>
<p>So, Mother Simpson, where did your newfound sense of irresponsibility take you?</p>
<p>I soon found people who shared my views at the state college.</p>
<p><em>Anthrax, gangrene, swimmer's ear.</em></p>
<p>Get your germ lab out of here!</p>
<p><em>Now! Now! How could I not become a radical... when we were fighting a force of pure evil?</p>
<p>Hey, hey, Mr. Burns.! Enough already with the germs.</em></p>
<p>Ptooh their flower power-</p>
<p><em>it's no match for my glower power.</em></p>
<p>Well, that's some nice glowering, Mr. &quot;B.&quot;</p>
<p><em>We'd met the enemy, and it was Montgomery Burns.</p>
<p>Drastic action had to be taken to stop his w*r machine.</em></p>
<p>I put Homer to bed, Abe. And now I'm going out.</p>
<p>It could be a late night. I'm meeting my destiny.</p>
<p>So long.</p>
<p>When this baby goes off, Burns's lab is gonna be history, man!</p>
<p>Germ history!</p>
<p>Oh, man! I got the munchies.</p>
<p>Oh! No!</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Bronchial tubes clearing. Asthma disappearing.</p>
<p>Acne... remains. But asthma disappearing.</p>
<p>My germs!</p>
<p>My precious germs! They never harmed a soul. They never even had a chance.</p>
<p>Whoever did this will never get past me.</p>
<p>You poor man. Let me help you up.</p>
<p>You just made a very big mistake.</p>
<p>You'll spend the rest of your life in pri-</p>
<p>My asthma's gone! Listen to me breathe.</p>
<p><em>From that moment on, my life as I knew it was over.</em></p>
<p>Only one member of the Springfield Seven was identified.</p>
<p>She's been described as a woman in her early 30s... yellow complexion and may be extremely helpful.</p>
<p><em>For Channel 6 News, I'm Kenny Brockelstein.</em></p>
<p>Homer.</p>
<p>I'll miss you, Homer.</p>
<p>I thought I dreamed that kiss.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry I misjudged you, Mom.</p>
<p>You had to leave to protect your family.</p>
<p>How did you survive?</p>
<p>Oh, I had help from my friends in the underground.</p>
<p>Jerry Rubin gave me a job marketing his line of health shakes...</p>
<p>I proofread Bobby Seale's cookbook... and I ran credit checks at Tom Hayden's Porsche dealership.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. There's one thing I don't understand.</p>
<p>In all those years, why didn't you ever try to contact me?</p>
<p>But I did. I sent you a care package every week.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, Mom. We use that same line on the kids when they're at camp.</p>
<p>But I did. I really did. I'll prove it to you.</p>
<p>Any undelivered mail for HomerJ. Simpson?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh, wait. This.</p>
<p>That's what happens when you don't tip your letter carrier at Christmas.</p>
<p>Yes, I'd like to send this letter to the Prussian consulate in Siam by aeromail.</p>
<p>Am I too late for the 4:30 autogiro?</p>
<p>Um, better look in the manual.</p>
<p>Ignorance.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. I know that woman.</p>
<p>But from when? And in what capacity?</p>
<p><em>It's her.!</em></p>
<p>At last!</p>
<p>This book must be out of date.</p>
<p>I don't see Prussia, Siam or autogiro.</p>
<p>Keep looking!</p>
<p>Are you sure this is the woman you saw in the post office?</p>
<p>Absolutely. Who could forget such a monstrous visage?</p>
<p>She has the sloping brow and cranial bumpage of the career criminal.</p>
<p>Uh, sir, phrenology was dismissed as quackery 160 years ago.</p>
<p>Of course you'd say that. You have the brainpan of a stagecoach tilter.</p>
<p>At any rate, the F.B.I. will track down this mystery woman... and put her behind bars.</p>
<p>How does it happen, Joe?</p>
<p>How does what happen?</p>
<p>How does a sweet young lady mortgage her future... for a bunch of scraggly ideals and greasy-haired promises?</p>
<p>Maybe she thought the w*r in Southeast Asia was so immoral her end justified the means.</p>
<p>Gee, Joe. You haven't been the same since your son went crazy in Vietnam.</p>
<p>It's a pain that never ends.</p>
<p>Seven!</p>
<p>No, Dad. It's a rhetorical question.</p>
<p>Rhetorical, eh?</p>
<p>Eight!</p>
<p>Dad, do you even know what &quot;rhetorical&quot; means?</p>
<p>Do I know what rhetorical means?</p>
<p><em>Quick, Grandma! Hide!</em></p>
<p>No door is gonna keep me from my meddlin'!</p>
<p>Stand up straight, Bart.</p>
<p>Abe?</p>
<p>What the-</p>
<p>Now, here's a piece of bad news.</p>
<p>Oh, Abe! You've aged terribly.</p>
<p>What do you expect? You left me to raise the boy on my own!</p>
<p>I had to leave! But you didn't have to tell Homer I was dead!</p>
<p>It was either that or tell him his mother was a wanted criminal!</p>
<p>You were a rotten wife, and I'll never ever forgive you!</p>
<p>Can we have sex? Please?</p>
<p>Oh, Abe!</p>
<p>Well, I tried. What's for supper?</p>
<p>Yeah. I might've seen her. It's hard to tell from this old picture, you know?</p>
<p>Well, according to our computer-aging program... she should look about...</p>
<p>25 years older.</p>
<p>Yeah, I seen her. Uh, that is to say, I saw her.</p>
<p>Look at me, Grandma. I'm a hippie. Peace, man.</p>
<p>Groovy. b*mb Vietnam!</p>
<p>Four more years! Up with people!</p>
<p>You know, Grandma, I used to think maybe I was adopted.</p>
<p>I couldn't understand how I fit into this family.</p>
<p>Now that I've met you, I suddenly make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>I'm so glad to see the spirit of the '60s is still alive in you kids.</p>
<p>Yep. I saw her.</p>
<p>That is to say, I seen her.</p>
<p>She seemed like a nice lady.</p>
<p>Well, that nice lady set the cause of biological warfare back 30 years.</p>
<p>We're only now finally caught up.</p>
<p>Two more ladies come by earlier that day.</p>
<p>One was real pretty.</p>
<p>Tother, sort of plain.</p>
<p>Ma'am, we're gonna need your assistance in locating this individual.</p>
<p>You're fresh.</p>
<p>Don't you want to play &quot;good cop, bad cop&quot;?</p>
<p>Ma'am, we're all good cops.</p>
<p>I had no intention of playing the good cop.</p>
<p>Look, we know you bought the tombstone.</p>
<p>We know the fugitive visited that tombstone. Whose tombstone was it?</p>
<p>Just lift up your coffee cups and see.</p>
<p>Good lord!</p>
<p>Put out an A.P. B... on a Uosdwis R. Dewoh.</p>
<p>Uh, better start with Greek town.</p>
<p>That's HomerJ. Simpson, Chief. You're reading it upside down.</p>
<p>Uh, cancel that A.P.B.</p>
<p>But, uh- Oh, bring back some of them, uh, gyros.</p>
<p>Uh, Chief, you're talking into your wallet.</p>
<p>Grandma, have you ever thought about moving back to Springfield?</p>
<p>You could live with Grampa again.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm a living joke.</p>
<p>You know, Lisa...</p>
<p><em>it might be nice to rest for a while.</p>
<p>Mom, there's nothing to be alarmed about.</em></p>
<p>But could you take one last look at the family and join me in the kitchen?</p>
<p>I've been waiting 25 years for this moment.</p>
<p><em>Huh?</em></p>
<p>I'm sorry, sir. I must've taped over that.</p>
<p>Freeze! F.B.I. The jig is up.</p>
<p>All right, I admit it. I am the Lindbergh baby.</p>
<p>Waah! Waah! Goo, goo. I miss my fly-fly dada.</p>
<p>Are you trying to stall us, or are you just senile?</p>
<p>A little from column &quot;A,&quot; a little from column &quot;B.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir, she's gone!</p>
<p>We made it, Homer!</p>
<p>It's all thanks to our anonymous tipster.</p>
<p>But who are you? And why did you tip us off?</p>
<p>Well, it's 'cause of your old lady that I got rid of the asthma... that was keeping me out of the academy.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Sure. Just think of me as an anonymous friend... who rose through the ranks of the Springfield Police... to become Chief Clancy Wig-</p>
<p>Yak, yak. Yak, yak, yak.</p>
<p>Well, there's my ride.</p>
<p>The underground awaits.</p>
<p>At least this time I'm awake for your good-bye.</p>
<p>Oh, Homer.</p>
<p>Remember, whatever happens, you have a mother... and she's truly proud of you.</p>
<p><em>Oh.! Hurry up, man.!</em></p>
<p>This electric van only has 20 minutes of juice left!</p>
<p>Don't forget me!</p>
<p>Don't worry, Homer.</p>
<p>You'll always be a part of me.</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
