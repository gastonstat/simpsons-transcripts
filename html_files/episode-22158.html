<p>Special Edna.</p>
<p>D'oh! Ah!</p>
<p>[SIZZLING]</p>
<p>The topic for your research paper will be World w*r I.</p>
<p>Was that the w*r with h*tler or Merlin?</p>
<p>Oh, you idiot. Merlin was in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Instead of writing a report, can I do a dance?</p>
<p>[HUMMING]</p>
<p>[MILHOUSE GRUNTS]</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>May I type my report?</p>
<p>It'll be easier on teacher's eyes.</p>
<p>Yes. In fact, why doesn't everyone type their paper?</p>
<p>Great idea, Martin.</p>
<p>Can the paper be 10 pages minimum?</p>
<p>Well, I was gonna say five, but okay. Thanks again, Martin.</p>
<p>Martin?</p>
<p>He's gone now. But you gotta admire his spirit.</p>
<p>All right, Seymour.</p>
<p>I'm ready for our romantic apple picking trip.</p>
<p>Yes. About that.</p>
<p>Mother's neck wattle got caught in a zipper.</p>
<p>I've, uh, got a long night of boo-boo kissing ahead of me.</p>
<p>But don't worry, I got you these store-bought apples instead.</p>
<p>The apples weren't the point.</p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]</p>
<p>Then why were we going apple picking?</p>
<p>[SIGHS]</p>
<p>Okay. Time to start this paper.</p>
<p>[SIGHS]</p>
<p>World w*r I. W-W-one.</p>
<p>Uh, that's a good start.</p>
<p>Time to watch wrestling.</p>
<p><strong>Announcer (on tv)</strong>: I can't believe it.</p>
<p>[GROANS]</p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: Uncle Slam has defeated Osama bin Rotten, wow.</p>
<p>Here comes Secretary of Hate, Colin Kapow!</p>
<p>He's dropping sanctions.</p>
<p>Unh!</p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: By which I mean anvils.</p>
<p>[OSAMA GRUNTS]</p>
<p>[TV AUDIENCE CHEERING]</p>
<p>[SIGHS]</p>
<p>Okay, gotta focus, gotta focus.</p>
<p>Gotta look at that bird.</p>
<p>Gotta focus.</p>
<p>[CLOCK TICKING]</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Damn it!</p>
<p>Why did I pay for a hundred Xeroxes when I only wanted one?</p>
<p>Well, I guess someone else will use the other 99.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Prank or study? Prank or study?</p>
<p>[GROANS]</p>
<p>What should I do, Lord? Give me a sign.</p>
<p>[LAUGHING]</p>
<p>[XEROX MACHINE WHIRRING]</p>
<p>[ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
<p>Now, if everyone would open your prayer books...</p>
<p>[YELLS]</p>
<p>[ALL SCREAMING]</p>
<p>[LAUGHS]</p>
<p>Well, boys, good thing we brought the eye soap.</p>
<p><strong>Rod and Todd</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p>The burning is love.</p>
<p>&quot;Russia, Great Britain and France had formed an entente cordiale...&quot;</p>
<p>[GROANS]</p>
<p>Ooh, Algebra.</p>
<p>I'll just do a few equations.</p>
<p>No. No more distractions.</p>
<p>Hey, Bart, wanna go for a ride in my uncle's Black Hawk helicopter?</p>
<p>But I just started my paper.</p>
<p>It's your last chance. He's probably gonna get court-martialed for this.</p>
<p>Black Hawk up.</p>
<p>[BART &amp; MILHOUSE LAUGHING]</p>
<p><strong>Bart (over speaker)</strong>: <em>Attention, teenage boys.</p>
<p>Take your hands off my daughter.</em></p>
<p>[BOYS WHIMPERING]</p>
<p><strong>Milhouse (over speaker)</strong>: <em>Now, kiss each other.</em></p>
<p>[SOBBING]</p>
<p>[BART &amp; MILHOUSE LAUGHING]</p>
<p>[FOOTSTEPS]</p>
<p>[WHISTLING]</p>
<p>Grampa, quick. Tell me everything you know about World w*r I.</p>
<p>World w*r I? I fought in that.</p>
<p>Of course, to enlist, I had to lie about my age.</p>
<p>[b*mb EXPLODING NEARBY]</p>
<p>Wanna see my picture I drew?</p>
<p>Lieutenant Simpson, you've been up for hours.</p>
<p>Take a nap. You're no good to us cranky.</p>
<p>But I'm not tired.</p>
<p>[CRYING]</p>
<p>Oh, this is great stuff. I can pad it out to 10 pages.</p>
<p>Good night, Grampa.</p>
<p>But I'm not tired.</p>
<p>Good night, sleepyhead.</p>
<p>Do you have to poop?</p>
<p>Always.</p>
<p>&quot;F&quot;? There must be some mistake. It's as long as you asked for.</p>
<p>Counting six pages of ads.</p>
<p>You're gonna have to redo your paper.</p>
<p>Well, if I may dust off an old chestnut: <em>Ay caramba.</em></p>
<p>[SIGHS]</p>
<p><em>Ay caramba </em>indeed.</p>
<p>&quot;And so on November 11th, 1918, the g*n fell silent and peace returned.</p>
<p>The end.&quot;</p>
<p>Very good, Bart.</p>
<p>Oh, I must have the wrong classroom.</p>
<p>I was looking for my girlfriend, not Pam Dawber.</p>
<p>[BOTH CHUCKLE]</p>
<p>Are you ready for a little after-school special?</p>
<p>Eyes front, Simpson.</p>
<p>[CELL PHONE RINGS]</p>
<p>Hello? Mother?</p>
<p>[SIGHS]</p>
<p>I'll be right there.</p>
<p>Now she wants to get out of the tub.</p>
<p>You've got to stop putting your mother ahead of me. We have a date.</p>
<p>I'll be back in three hours. Maybe less.</p>
<p>But almost certainly more.</p>
<p>[DOOR CLOSES]</p>
<p>[SOBS]</p>
<p>He's a wiener, Mrs. K.</p>
<p>Just say the word and his desk is full of boogers.</p>
<p>[CRIES]</p>
<p>That's sweet of you.</p>
<p>But if I lost Seymour, who else is there?</p>
<p><em>I believe in miracles.</p>
<p>Where you from You sexy thing?</p>
<p>Sexy thing, you.</p>
<p>I believe...</em></p>
<p>Okay. There's a lot of low cards in that hand.</p>
<p>Since we're both free, why don't you and me hit the town?</p>
<p>A pity date from a 10 year old? I'll take it.</p>
<p>From the widest gully to the deepest trench... holes define who we are and where we are going.</p>
<p>And although Rover here may not know it... he is participating in a ritual as old as time itself.</p>
<p>He is giving birth to a hole.</p>
<p>Or consider the dolphin, nature's most filmed creature.</p>
<p>Even they have holes. Blowholes.</p>
<p>Thanks for going out with me tonight.</p>
<p>It really took my mind off stupid jerks and their mothers.</p>
<p>[SIGHS]</p>
<p>And did you know the hole's only natural enemy is the pile?</p>
<p>I can't believe you went to the movies with the teacher.</p>
<p>What happened to the Bart Simpson who put the mothballs in the beef stew?</p>
<p>I only hung out with Krabappel because Skinner blew her off.</p>
<p>I've never seen her so sad.</p>
<p>You know what made me feel better about myself?</p>
<p>That award I got for World's Greatest Dad.</p>
<p>Dad, you bought that because it was full of gummy worms.</p>
<p>And you only wanted those as bait to catch gummy fish.</p>
<p>Which I did.</p>
<p>Mm, trophy.</p>
<p>Hey, Bart, you could nominate Mrs. Krabappel for an actual award... the Teacher of the Year. Then she'll feel appreciated.</p>
<p>They have an award for teaching?</p>
<p>Hey, they have Latin Grammys.</p>
<p>It is so hard to choose nominees from all these qualified candidates.</p>
<p>This is the most difficult one-day-a-year job in the world.</p>
<p>Put in the next tape.</p>
<p><em>I use humor to reach my students.</em></p>
<p>[JUDGES GROAN]</p>
<p><em>Dead Poets Society</em> has destroyed a generation of educators.</p>
<p>[LAUGHING]</p>
<p>And so President Kennedy says to Khrushchev: &quot;Well, enough jawing. Reach for it, pilgrim.&quot;</p>
<p>And the m*ssile are like, &quot;Oh, praise Jesus! Can I hear an amen?&quot;</p>
<p>[SINGS] <em>Hey, Macarena</em></p>
<p>Next.</p>
<p><em>I'd like to nominate my teacher... Mrs. Krabappel. She may not be glamorous or entertaining... she's just a real teacher who comes in every day no matter what.</p>
<p>And she never gave up on me, Bart Simpson.</em></p>
<p>[ALL GASP]</p>
<p>The Bart Simpson?</p>
<p>I thought he was an urban legend.</p>
<p>If she's danced with the devil in the blue shorts and lived... we have ourselves a nominee.</p>
<p><strong>Judges</strong>: Mm-hm.</p>
<p>Oh, Lord, it's only Wednesday.</p>
<p>I hope one of those little hoods puts a tack on my chair... just so I can feel something.</p>
<p>[CHEERING]</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>Edna Krabappel... you've been nominated for Teacher of the Year.</p>
<p>[KIDS CHEERING]</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>[SOBBING]</p>
<p>Ha, ha, you're a-crying.</p>
<p>Nelson Muntz, you've been nominated for Bully of the Year.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>[SOBS]</p>
<p>Wedgie.</p>
<p>Unh!</p>
<p>[GRUNTS]</p>
<p>How does it feel to be nominated for Teacher of the Year?</p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]</p>
<p>I can't believe it.</p>
<p>This after I accidentally showed the R-rated <em>Romeo and Juliet.</em></p>
<p>I thought that nipple would haunt me forever.</p>

<p>Oh, oh. Reporter Cletus, <em>Outhouse Times-Picayune.</em></p>
<p>Is there any persons, critters or spells to which you attribute this accolade?</p>
<p>There's one person I'd like to thank for this.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>We've had our ups and downs, but I can't imagine life without him.</p>
<p>Bart Simpson.</p>
<p>[CROWD CLAPPING]</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Way to go, Bart.</p>
<p>I can't express how I feel in words, so I drew this picture.</p>
<p>These stink lines stand for dedication, caring... and for letting me drink coffee in class.</p>
<p>Way to go, Edna.</p>
<p><strong>Woman 1</strong>: Yes, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Woman 2</strong>: Way to go!</p>
<p>Oh, oh.</p>
<p>Follow-up query.</p>
<p>Mrs. K, if you win this here learning derby... will you forget your kith and kin and leave us all forever?</p>
<p>Leave us forever?</p>
<p>I'd better pee on this fire.</p>
<p>As principal, I'd just like to say a few words... about what this wonderful woman means to this school and to me.</p>
<p><em>Webster's Dictionary</em> defines Mrs. Krabappel as...</p>
<p>[PAGER BEEPING]</p>
<p>Excuse me. I have an emergency page from mother.</p>
<p>This press conference is over.</p>
<p>[GROANS]</p>
<p>So because I nominated Mrs. K... our whole family gets a free trip to the awards ceremony in Orlando.</p>
<p>Orlando? Are we going to SeaWorld?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Disney World?</p>
<p>Uh-uh.</p>
<p>Universal Studios?</p>
<p>Afraid not.</p>
<p>Leisure World?</p>
<p>Sorry, Grampa.</p>
<p>Gator Gulch?</p>
<p>You wish.</p>
<p>Leisure World?</p>
<p>Grampa, you're not even going.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. I know where we're going.</p>
<p>Oh, it's horrible!</p>
<p>Oh, it's even boring to fly over it.</p>
<p>[CRYING]</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>It's so exciting. I'm meeting my peers.</p>
<p>Ooh, The Future Sphere.</p>
<p>It's what people in 1965 imagined what life would be like in 1987.</p>
<p><strong>Ride Announcer</strong>: <em>Eastern Airlines presents... &quot;The World of Tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>Don't walk, fly... in your personal Eastern Airlines Air Buggy.</p>
<p>And say goodbye to the cola wars.</p>
<p>The victor, Eastern Airlines Cola.</p>
<p>And we're not stopping there.</p>
<p>Because at Eastern Airlines, world conquest is part of our master plan.</p>
<p>Now, enjoy the soothing music of The Turtles.</em></p>
<p>[THE TURTLES' &quot;HAPPY TOGETHER&quot; PLAYING OVER SPEAKER]</p>
<p>It's nice and cool in here, don't you think?</p>
<p><strong>Ride Announcer</strong>: <em>Welcome to the electric car of the future... sponsored by the gasoline producers of America.</em></p>
<p>[CAR SPUTTERING]</p>
<p><strong>Car</strong>: <em>Hello. I'm an electric car.</p>
<p>I can't go very fast or very far.</p>
<p>And if you drive me, people will think you're gay.</em></p>
<p>[IN UNISON] One of us! One of us!</p>
<p>Willie, you're no stranger to the inner workings of the female mind.</p>
<p>Aye. Willie's sent many a Vermont Teddy Bear.</p>
<p>Well, I'm a little worried that, uh, with all this attention... Edna may meet someone better.</p>
<p>Damn straight she will, you brunch-eating popinjay.</p>
<p>Your woman's in Orlando, man.</p>
<p>You can't take two steps there without falling into a tunnel of love.</p>
<p>Oh, I've been a fool.</p>
<p>I've gotta go after her.</p>
<p>Take me car.</p>
<p>Unh.</p>
<p>[BEEPING]</p>
<p><em>Make sure you fill it up with Techron gas.</p>
<p>You don't want a case of the knocks.</em></p>
<p>Wow, this restaurant is so international.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Le </em>Pizza, <em>Der </em>Hamburger, Señor Grilled Cheese.&quot;</p>

<p>What happened to you two?</p>
<p><strong>Audience</strong>: Ew!</p>
<p>Let's go make some fireworks of our own.</p>
<p>I get to tamp the powder.</p>
<p>I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]</p>
<p>Oh, I wish I had someone to share this with.</p>
<p>Edna Krabappel, please report to the principal's arms.</p>
<p>[GASPS]</p>
<p>Oh, you came.</p>
<p>Ha. I took a personal day.</p>
<p>[BOTH MOANING]</p>
<p>Seymour! Bring me some ice.</p>
<p>My fanny is baboon red after that car ride.</p>
<p>Ow! Mother, we were sharing an open-mouthed kiss.</p>
<p>You brought your mother?</p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]</p>
<p>Well, technically, since she's paying for the room, she brought me.</p>
<p>[SCOFFS]</p>
<p>I am tired of sharing you with your mother.</p>
<p>This woman carried me for nine-and-a-half months.</p>
<p>I was out for two weeks and then went back in.</p>
<p>Ugh!</p>
<p>Hey, Skinner.</p>
<p>You and Edna wanna join Marge and me at Great Moments With Mr. Eisner?</p>
<p>I believe the only venue for me is the ride of broken dreams.</p>
<p>Oh, you mean the Enron ride. Let's go.</p>
<p>[COASTER RATTLING]</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: We're all gonna be rich!</p>
<p>[SCREAMING]</p>
<p><strong>Man 1</strong>: We broke even.</p>
<p>[SCREAMING]</p>
<p>[ALL GROAN]</p>
<p><strong>Man 2</strong>: Mm, that's good satire.</p>
<p>[LISA GASPS]</p>
<p>Mom, is that Principal Skinner sleeping in the bed of tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>Mother Robot</strong>: Rise and shine, sleepyhead.</p>
<p>You'll be late for the next rocket to the moon.</p>
<p>He's never going to get up. He's got no legs.</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>Oh, well, since Edna dumped me... I've been wandering around this park all night.</p>
<p>It's educational and offers mild thrills.</p>
<p>Just like Edna.</p>
<p>Now before the show, you'll need to take urine tests... to prove you're not taking teaching-enhancing drugs.</p>
<p>[LAUGHING]</p>
<p>You can't test what's not there.</p>
<p>We're also pleased to announce that our winner will receive enough money... so they'll never have to teach again.</p>
<p>[CHEERING]</p>
<p>Good Lord. I may lose Edna forever.</p>
<p>I've gotta stop her from winning.</p>
<p>Then she'll be broken, miserable and mine.</p>
<p>Don't look back. Just keep driving.</p>
<p>Seymour? Glad you're here.</p>
<p>You can help me play &quot;Halloween Hit and Run.&quot;</p>
<p>[SCREAMING]</p>
<p>Ooh, this game is gonna get some disapproving clucks.</p>
<p>But for now, I need my tongue to talk to you.</p>
<p>I don't wanna lose Edna... so I need you to sabotage her chances of winning tonight.</p>
<p>But I don't wanna hurt Mrs. K.</p>
<p>All right, Bart. I didn't wanna resort to this, but...</p>
<p>This drawing was found on the wall of Springfield Elementary last week.</p>
<p>All right, I'm in. I'll humiliate the love of your life.</p>
<p>Because I like you, I'll even do it pro boner.</p>
<p>It's pro bono.</p>
<p>I know what I said.</p>
<p>Oh, this is the worst thing I've ever done.</p>
<p>Even worse than what I did in Nam.</p>
<p>You're gonna get your parade, down my esophagus.</p>
<p>[GROANS]</p>
<p>So many categories.</p>
<p>&quot;Gym Teacher of the Year, Substitute Teacher of the Year... Most Wheelchair-Accessible School award&quot;?</p>
<p>[GASPS]</p>
<p>Oh, who will take home the Rampy?</p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: <em>And now, to present our final award... for Teacher of the Year, Little Richard.</em></p>
<p>I love teachers.</p>
<p>In fact, I'm a teacher.</p>
<p>I taught Paul McCartney to go: Whoo!</p>
<p>&quot;Purple Rain!&quot;</p>
<p>Shut up!</p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]</p>
<p>Michael Jackson just told me to shut up.</p>
<p>We're down to our last three teachers, folks.</p>
<p>And the winner will be decided by one final question... asked by the students who nominated them.</p>
<p>[AUDIENCE CLAPPING]</p>
<p><strong>Skinner (thinking)</strong>: <em>I feel terrible.</p>
<p>But this is the only way I can win Edna without upsetting Mother.</em></p>
<p><strong>Agnes (thinking)</strong>: <em>He has the tiny hands of a chimp.</em></p>
<p>And now, Bart Simpson will ask a question to his teacher.</p>
<p>[STUTTERING] &quot;Wha... What woul...?&quot;</p>
<p>Hurry up, son.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I can't read.</p>
<p>Mrs. Krabappel never taught me to read.</p>
<p>[GASPING]</p>
<p>Is this true, Edna?</p>
<p>[SIGHS]</p>
<p>Oh, God. I've created a Prankenstein.</p>
<p>Wait. That boy is lying. He's not illiterate.</p>
<p>And he's good around the potty too.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, everyone.</p>
<p>I perpetrated this charade.</p>
<p>Hmph.</p>
<p>The boy can read.</p>
<p>Edna Krabappel is the greatest teacher I've ever known.</p>
<p>[GASPS]</p>
<p>If she can teach me to love, then she can teach anything.</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Aw.</p>
<p>Seymour! Your feelings are ugly and wrong.</p>
<p>Are you gonna listen to her?</p>
<p>Not on your life, Reverend. From now on, I'm my own man.</p>
<p>I have waited to hear that for so long.</p>
<p>And it gets better.</p>
<p>Edna Krabappel, will you marry me?</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Now, I must warn you, two months' salary only bought me the ring box.</p>
<p>Oh, here, honey. Take one of mine. Whoo!</p>
<p>Oh! I felt naked there for a minute.</p>
<p>[GASPS]</p>
<p>Seymour, of course I'll marry you.</p>
<p>Oh, great. Three in a bed.</p>
<p>Since the show is running long, we'll just name a winner.</p>
<p>[IN UNISON] Edna! Edna!</p>
<p>Julio Estudiante... an inner-city math teacher who taught teenage gang members... that differential equations are more powerful than b*ll*ts.</p>
<p>What a rip! You all should be ashamed!</p>
<p>Well, I didn't win Teacher of the Year.</p>
<p>But I didn't go home empty-handed.</p>
<p>Do you wanna check out the bed of tomorrow today?</p>
<p>Oh, Seymour.</p>
<p>[EDNA CHUCKLES]</p>
<p>I love happy endings.</p>
<p>Well, here's ours.</p>
<p>We're going to Disney World.</p>
<p>[GRUNTING]</p>
<p>[SIRENS WAILING]</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Mouse [over speaker]</strong>: <em>Step away from the wall.</p>
<p>Step away from the wall.</em></p>
<p>Oh, it's so beautiful.</p>
<p>[GRUNTS]</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: One churro, please.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: That'll be $14.</p>
<p>[HOMER WAILING]</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Here.</p>
<p>Boy, those pies look good.</p>
<p>Open your gullet, you human blob.</p>
<p>Well, what do you think?</p>
<p>[GULPS]</p>
<p>[SINGING] <em>What do I think of the pie?</p>
<p>What do I think of the pie?</p>
<p>Goodness gracious it's delicious.</p>
<p>That's what I think of the pie.</p>
<p>Because...</em></p>
<p>Should we follow him?</p>
<p>I'm on vacation.</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Shh.</p>
