<p>D'oh! [Screams]</p>
<p>[Chuckling] Which, if true, means death for us all.</p>
<p>And now, &quot;Kent's People.&quot;</p>
<p>Tonight's inspiring story is about Frank Grimes... a 35-year-old &quot;Springfieldite&quot; who has earned everything the hard way... but never let adversity get him down.</p>
<p><em>Abandoned by his parents at age four...</p>
<p>Frank never got to go to school.</p>
<p>He spent his childhood years as a delivery boy... delivering toys to more fortunate children.</p>
<p>Then, on his I (th birthday... he was blown up in a silo expl*si*n.</p>
<p>During his long recuperation, he taught himself to hear... and feel pain again.</p>
<p>As the years passed, he used his few leisure moments each day... to study science by mail.</p>
<p>And, last week, Frank Grimes... the man who had to struggle for everything he ever got... received his correspondence school diploma in nuclear physics- with a minor in determination.</em></p>
<p>[Cawing]</p>
<p>[Grunting]</p>
<p>That's the kind of man I need on my team, Smithers-</p>
<p>[Sniffling] A real scrapper.</p>
<p>A self-made man, like me.</p>
<p>Bring this Grimes fellow to me.</p>
<p>I want to make him my executive vice president.</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Smithers, I've just seen the most heroic dog on television.</p>
<p>He pulled a toddler from the path of a speeding car... then pushed a criminal in front of it.</p>
<p>Find this dog. I want to make him my executive vice president.</p>
<p>Uh, yes, sir.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here's Frank Grimes.</p>
<p>[Clears Throat] The self-made man?</p>
<p>What? Oh, yes, that fellow. Just put him somewhere out of the way.</p>
<p>And find that dog.</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p>[Groans]</p>
<p>Chair goes round. Chair goes round.</p>
<p>Hey, Homer, you busy?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There's a new guy at the plant.</p>
<p>Maybe we ought to say hi to him.</p>
<p>I don't know. I'm kind of dizzy.</p>
<p>I should probably go home sick.</p>
<p>Mmm- Hmm.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Mmm... hmm.</p>
<p>You new?</p>
<p>Yes. My name is Frank Grimes.</p>
<p>I'm Lenny. This is Carl and Homer.</p>
<p>I'm Lenny.</p>
<p>How do you do?</p>
<p>Wow. You've got pencils with your name on 'em.</p>
<p>Just like a pencil company executive.</p>
<p>I'd give anything for one of these.</p>
<p>Any office supply company can have 'em made up for you.</p>
<p>Can I have this one?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Can... Lenny have it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh, that's my degree in nuclear physics.</p>
<p>I'm sure you all have one.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Carl and I each have a masters.</p>
<p>Of course, old Homer- He didn't need a degree.</p>
<p><em>Hejust showed up the day they opened the plant.</em></p>
<p>[Chuckles]</p>
<p>I didn't even know what a nuclear &quot;panner&quot; plant was.</p>
<p>Um- [Chuckles]</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, listen.</p>
<p>I'm sure we all have a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>Mm-mmm.</p>
<p>Mm-mmm.</p>
<p>Hey, you seem like a great guy, so I'll give you a little tip.</p>
<p>If you turn that security camera around... you can sleep and no one will ever know.</p>
<p>I don't think we're being paid to sleep.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. They're always trying to screw you.</p>
<p>[Groans]</p>
<p>&quot;Marge&quot; is already taken?</p>
<p>Mmm, how about &quot;Marjorie&quot;?</p>
<p>[Typing]</p>
<p>Uh, sorry, ma'am.</p>
<p>[Groans]</p>
<p>Mmm, how about &quot;Mitzi&quot;?</p>
<p>[Typing]</p>
<p>Uh-uh.</p>
<p>Uh, you can have &quot;Nitzi.&quot;</p>
<p>Hmm. &quot;Nitzi.&quot;</p>
<p>I'm out of here.</p>
<p><em><strong>Man</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, our next lot is number 751.</em></p>
<p>How much am I bid for ltem 751? 7-5-1?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>No bids for item 751?</p>
<p>A buck.</p>
<p>I have a buck. I have one dollar. I have one dollar there.</p>
<p>[Babbling]</p>
<p>Do I hear two? [Babbling]</p>
<p>Sold- for a buck.</p>
<p>Cool. What'd I buy?</p>
<p>35 Industry Way.</p>
<p>Looks like my years of hard work have finally paid off.</p>
<p>[Chomping]</p>
<p>Hiya, stretch. What's the good word?</p>
<p>My name is Grimes, Simpson, Frank Grimes.</p>
<p>I took the trouble to learn your name.</p>
<p>The least you can do is learn mine.</p>
<p>[Laughing] Okay, &quot;Grimey.&quot;</p>
<p>Uh-You're eating my special dietetic lunch.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Uh- [Clears Throat]</p>
<p>[Laughs]</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>The bag was clearly marked. Please be more careful in the future.</p>
<p>Check.</p>
<p>♪ [Humming]</p>
<p>Mmm-</p>
<p>[Groans]</p>
<p>Simpson, do you know who chewed my-</p>
<p>[Squeaking]</p>
<p>[Groaning]</p>
<p>[Chittering]</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>It's filthy- and it's mine.</p>
<p>[Chuckling]</p>
<p>Whee!</p>
<p>[Groans]</p>
<p>So, how's it going, Grimey? l-I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of my office, Simpson.</p>
<p>[Chuckles] I wish I had a nickel for every time I heard that.</p>
<p>♪ [Humming]</p>
<p><em>[Blows Raspberries]</p>
<p>♪ [Singing]</em></p>
<p>So, what's new, Grimey?</p>
<p><em>[Alarm Blaring]</em></p>
<p>Simpson, you've got a 513.</p>
<p>No, a 513- In your procedures manual? A 513?</p>
<p><em>[Alarm Continues]</em></p>
<p>Look at your control panel.</p>
<p>Oh! A five <em>13.</em></p>
<p>I'll handle it.</p>
<p><em>[Alarm Stops]</em></p>
<p>That got it.</p>
<p>[Whistles] Hey, Milhouse.</p>
<p><em>You want a job in my factory?</em></p>
<p>You don't have a factory.</p>
<p>Hey, I'm a busy man. You want a job or not?</p>
<p>Okay!</p>
<p>[Chomping]</p>
<p>God, he eats like a pig.</p>
<p>I don't know. Pigs tend to chew.</p>
<p>I'd say he eats more like a duck.</p>
<p>Well, some kind of farm animal anyway.</p>
<p>And earlier today I saw him asleep inside a radiation suit.</p>
<p>Can you imagine that? He was hanging from a coat hook.</p>
<p>[Chuckles] He had three beers at lunch.</p>
<p>That would make anybody sleepy.</p>
<p>I've never seen him do any work around here. What is his job?</p>
<p>Safety inspector.</p>
<p>That irresponsible oaf?</p>
<p>A man who, by all rights, should have been k*ll dozens of times by now?</p>
<p>Uh, 316 times, by my count.</p>
<p>That's the man who's in charge of our safety?</p>
<p>It boggles the mind.</p>
<p>It's best not to think about it.</p>
<p>[Chomping]</p>
<p>Ah! Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!</p>
<p>You idiot! You nearly drank a beaker full of sulfuric acid.</p>
<p>Acid, eh? Gee. That would have been stupid. [Laughs]</p>
<p>Boy, would my face have been red.</p>
<p>Stop laughing, you imbecile.</p>
<p>Don't you realize how close you just came to k*ll yourself?</p>
<p>Who did this to my wall?</p>
<p>He did.</p>
<p>Is this true?</p>
<p>[Stammering] l-Well-</p>
<p>Technically, it is true, sir, but-</p>
<p>Come with me.</p>
<p>He likes you.</p>
<p><em>[Dog Barking]</p>
<p>[Burns] How dare you destroy my valuable wall and spill my priceless acid?</p>
<p>Did you really think you were going to get away with it?</p>
<p>[Grimes] I wasn't- - Silence!</p>
<p>I'm going to give you one more chance- at a reduced salary.</p>
<p>So straighten up and fly right.</p>
<p>But, sir, if I could-</p>
<p>[Dog Barks, Growls]</em></p>
<p>Hi, Grimey, old buddy.</p>
<p>I'm not your buddy, Simpson.</p>
<p>I don't like you. In fact, I hate you.</p>
<p>Stay the hell away from me-</p>
<p>Because from now on, we're enemies.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do I have to do anything?</p>
<p>[Groans]</p>
<p>Oh, I can't believe it. I got an enemy.</p>
<p>Me-The most beloved man in Springfield.</p>
<p>Aw, it's a weird world, Homer.</p>
<p>As hard as it is to believe, some people don't care for me neither.</p>
<p>No, I won't accept that.</p>
<p>No, it's true. I got their names written down right here... in what I call my, uh, enemies list.</p>
<p>&quot;Jane Fonda, Daniel Schorr, Jack Anderson&quot;-</p>
<p>Hey! This is Richard Nixon's enemies list.</p>
<p>You just crossed out his name and put yours.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, gimme that. Gimme it back.</p>
<p>&quot;Barney Gumble.&quot;</p>
<p>[Groans]</p>
<p>Oh, what'll I do, Moe?</p>
<p>Why don't you invite him over to dinner-</p>
<p>Turn him from an enemy into a friend?</p>
<p>Then, when he's not expecting it- Bam!</p>
<p>The old fork in the eye.</p>
<p>Do you think it might work without the fork in the eye?</p>
<p>There's always a first time.</p>
<p>This dinner has to go absolutely perfect... if Grimey and me are going to be friends.</p>
<p>Lisa, be perfect.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Marge, perfect. Bart, perfect.</p>
<p>Other kid, perfect.</p>
<p>I only have five lobsters. Are you sure he's not bringing anyone with him?</p>
<p>No. No. He doesn't know he's coming to dinner.</p>
<p>I didn't think he'd come, so I said I have something really important to tell him... and that I could only tell him about it here.</p>

<p><em>[Doorbell Rings]</em></p>
<p>Oh! It's him! It's him, it's him. It's him, it's him, it's him... it's him, it's him, it's him-</p>
<p>Calm down, Homer.</p>
<p>Calm down. Answer the door.</p>
<p>[Taking Deep Breaths]</p>
<p>Welcome to the Simpson residence... or &quot;Casa de Simpson,&quot; as I call it. [Chuckles]</p>
<p>What did you want to see me about, Simpson? This better be important.</p>
<p>It is, it is, but first let me introduce you to my family-</p>
<p>My perfect family.</p>
<p>This is my wife, Marge.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p><em>And our beautiful baby.</p>
<p>My daughter Lisa- I.Q. 156.</em></p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p><em>See? And my son Bart.</em></p>
<p>[Clicks Tongue]</p>
<p><em>He owns a factory downtown.</em></p>
<p>H-How do you do? Homer, I'm late for my night job at the foundry... so if you don't mind telling me-</p>
<p>Good heavens! Th-This is a palace!</p>
<p><em>[Stammering] H- How in the world can you afford... to live in a house like this, Simpson?</em></p>
<p>I don't know. Don't ask me how the economy works.</p>
<p>Yeah, but look at the size of this place.</p>
<p>I live in a single room above a bowling alley... and below another bowling alley.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. Isn't that-</p>
<p>Yeah, that's me, all right. And the guy standing next to me is President Gerald Ford.</p>
<p>And this is when I was on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins.</p>
<p><em>Oh! And here's a picture of me in outer space.</em></p>
<p>You... went into outer space? You?</p>
<p>Sure. You've never been?</p>
<p>Would you like to see my Grammy award?</p>
<p>No! I wouldn't. God. I've had to work hard every day of my life... and what do I have to show for it?</p>
<p>This briefcase and this haircut.</p>
<p>And what do you have to show for your lifetime of sloth and ignorance?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Everything!</p>
<p>A dream house, two cars, a beautiful wife... a son who owns a factory, fancy clothes and- [Sniffing] lobsters for dinner.</p>
<p>And do you deserve any of it? No!</p>
<p>[Gasps] What are you saying?</p>
<p>[Laughs] I'm saying... you're what's wrong with America, Simpson.</p>
<p>You coast through life, you do as little as possible... and you leach off decent, hard-working people- like me.</p>
<p>[Laughs] If you lived in any other country in the world... you'd have starved to death long ago.</p>
<p>He's got you there, Dad.</p>
<p>You're a fraud-A total fraud.</p>
<p>It was nice meeting you.</p>
<p><em>[Door Slams]</em></p>
<p>[All Groan]</p>
<p><em>[Milhouse] Wow! Adding machines.</p>
<p>Industrial waste.</em></p>
<p>What should we do with all this stuff, Bart?</p>
<p>I think we both know the answer to that.</p>
<p>[Sighs]</p>
<p><em>[Pounding]</em></p>
<p>Get to work!</p>
<p>[Together] Wacky shack!</p>
<p>Better be careful, Bart. Look at those warning signs.</p>
<p>Solve your problem, Milhouse?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>[Both Laughing]</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Homer? Homer, why aren't you at work?</p>
<p>The car won't start.</p>
<p>I don't feel very good today. I <em>am</em> at work.</p>
<p>You're afraid to go to work because Frank Grimes will be there, aren't you?</p>
<p>Well, that's crazy talk.</p>
<p>You're crazy, Marge.</p>
<p>Get off the road!</p>
<p>[Honks]</p>
<p>You'll have to face him sometime, and when you do...</p>
<p>I'm sure he'll be just as anxious to make up as you are.</p>
<p>No, he won't. He hates me.</p>
<p>He doesn't hate you.</p>
<p>He just feels insecure because you're getting through life so easily... and it's been so difficult for him.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Yeah, that's his problem. He's a nut.</p>
<p>It's not about me being lazy.</p>
<p>It's about him being a crazy nut.</p>
<p>Well, maybe-</p>
<p>But I'll bet he would be less crazy if you were just a little more... mmm, professional in your work.</p>
<p>[Gasps]</p>
<p>Just a little more.</p>
<p>Then he won't have any reason to resent you.</p>
<p>I'll do it.</p>
<p>To professionalism.</p>
<p>Good morning, fellow employee.</p>
<p>You'll notice that I am now a model worker.</p>
<p>We should continue this conversation later... during a designated break period.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Homer Simpson.</p>
<p><em>[Alarm Blaring]</em></p>
<p>Can you believe that guy?</p>
<p>He's in his office making a pathetic attempt to look professional.</p>
<p>Hey, what do you got against Homer anyway?</p>
<p>Are you kidding?</p>
<p>Does this whole plant have some disease... where it can't see that he's an idiot? Look here.</p>
<p>Accidents have doubled every year since he became safety inspector.</p>
<p>And meltdowns have tripled.</p>
<p>Has he been fired? No. Has he been disciplined? No, no.</p>
<p>Aw, everybody makes mistakes.</p>
<p>That's why they put erasers on pencils.</p>
<p>Yeah, Homer's okay. Give him a break.</p>
<p>No! Homer is not okay-</p>
<p>And I want everyone in this plant to realize it.</p>
<p>I would die a happy man if I could prove to you... that Homer Simpson has the intelligence of a six-year-old.</p>
<p>So. How you doin'?</p>
<p>[Groans]</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Oh, here we go.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><em>Oh!</em></p>
<p>&quot;Design your own power plant,&quot; eh?</p>
<p>This is my chance to show everyone how professional I am.</p>
<p>Lenny, tell Mr. Burns I'm going home to work on the contest.</p>
<p>[Snickering]</p>
<p>[Snickering Continues]</p>
<p>Oh, God!</p>
<p><em>[Power Tool Whining]</p>
<p>[Homer Shouting, Indistinct]</p>
<p>Ow! [Shouting]</em></p>
<p>Can I go downstairs and see what Dad's doing?</p>
<p>I wouldn't bother him, honey.</p>
<p>He's making some kind of model for a contest.</p>
<p>He says it's really high-tech stuff that we wouldn't understand.</p>
<p>Marge, do we have any elbow macaroni and glue-on sparkles?</p>
<p><em>[Pounding]</em></p>
<p>[Grunting]</p>
<p>[Whistling]</p>
<p>Oh, boy! Quittin' time!</p>
<p>Just a minute, Van Houten. Somebody needs to guard this place tonight... so it doesn't get trashed.</p>
<p>How'd you like to be night watchman?</p>
<p>But I'm sleepy.</p>
<p>Oh, no problemo. Here's a nickel for the coffee machine.</p>
<p>[Squeaking]</p>
<p>So this is my life.</p>
<p>At least I've done better than Dad.</p>
<p>[Whistling, Gasps]</p>
<p>Aw, geez!</p>
<p>Milhouse, how could you let this happen?</p>
<p>You were supposed to be the night watchman.</p>
<p>I was watching. I saw the whole thing.</p>
<p>First it started falling over, and then it fell over.</p>
<p>Wow. I wonder where all the rats are gonna go.</p>
<p>[Chittering]</p>
<p><em><strong>Moe</strong>: Okay, everybody tuck your pants into your socks.</em></p>
<p>And the bold new ideas these tiny tykes unveil for us today... could make thousands of jobs like yours... obsolete.</p>
<p><em>[Scattered Applause]</em></p>
<p>Our first little genius is Ralph Wiggum.</p>
<p>[Chuckles] It's pretty good, sir.</p>
<p>Hot tub, media room-</p>
<p>It's supposed to be a power plant, not Aunt Beulah's bordello.</p>
<p>Thank you. Get out.</p>
<p>Next.</p>
<p><em>[Wiggum] Uh, Ralphie, get off the stage, sweetheart.</em></p>
<p>Behold-The power plant of the future... today.</p>
<p>[Groans] Too cold and sterile.</p>
<p>Where's the heart?</p>
<p>But it really generates power. It's lighting this room right now.</p>
<p><em>[Electronic Whine]</em></p>
<p>You lose. Get off my property. Let's have the next child.</p>
<p>Look, everybody.</p>
<p>Simpson's in a contest with children.</p>
<p>Hey, shh!</p>
<p>You're making us miss the contest.</p>
<p>Could you explain your model, young man?</p>
<p>What's to explain? He's an idiot!</p>
<p>[Lenny] Pipe down!</p>
<p>Well, basically, I just copied the plant we have now.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Then I added some fins to lower wind resistance-</p>
<p>And this racing stripe here, I feel is pretty sharp.</p>
<p>Agreed. First prize.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Way to go, Homer.</p>
<p>You're number one, Homer.</p>
<p>But this was a contest for children!</p>
<p>Yeah-And Homer b*at their brains out.</p>
<p>[Cheers, Applause]</p>
<p>I can't stand it any longer. This whole plant is insane.</p>
<p>Insane, I tell you!</p>
<p>[Stammers, Screams]</p>
<p>[Whimpering]</p>
<p>I can be lazy too. Look at me.</p>
<p>Hi. I'm a worthless employee, just like Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>Give me a promotion.</p>
<p>Ooh, I eat like a slob, but nobody minds.</p>
<p>[Chomping]</p>
<p><em>I'm peeing on the seat. Give me a raise.</em></p>
<p>Now I'm returning to work without washing my hands-</p>
<p>But it doesn't matter, because I'm Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>I don't need to do my work, 'cause someone else will do it for me.</p>
<p>D'oh, d'oh, d'oh.</p>
<p>Hey, you okay, Grimey?</p>
<p>I'm better than okay.</p>
<p>I'm Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>[Laughs] You wish.</p>
<p>Oh, hi, Mr. Burns. I'm the worst worker in the world.</p>
<p>Time to go home to my mansion and eat my lobster.</p>
<p>What's this? &quot;Extremely high voltage.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, I don't need safety gloves, because I'm Homer Simp-</p>
<p><em>Frank Grimes-</em> or &quot;Grimey,&quot; as he liked to be called- taught us that a man can triumph over adversity... and even though Frank's... agonizing struggle through life was tragically cut short...</p>
<p>I am sure he's looking down... - [Snoring] from heaven right now- [Continues, Indistinct][/i]</p>
<p>Change the channel, Marge.</p>
<p>[Mourners Laughing]</p>
<p>That's our Homer.</p>
<p>[Laughter Continues]</p>
<p>[Murmuring]</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
