<p>(SCREAMS)</p>
<p>(BRAKES SCREECHING)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p>(GULPING)</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey! No enjoying it!</p>
<p>Kent Brockman here with Stormwatch 6.</p>
<p>Professor Frink, what's the scientific explanation for this unusually severe thunderstorm?</p>
<p>Well, Kent, we are, uh, exploring two theories at this point.</p>
<p>Um, A, either we have a super cell of high-pressure fronts, or B, God is bowling!</p>
<p>With the balls and the pins and the rental shoes and the very bad cheese pizza that comes in squares.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING) Krusty, what's your lighthearted take on our recent bad weather?</p>
<p>Sorry, Kent. I sold all my bad weatherjokes to Jay Mohr.</p>
<p>But I can make funny sounds in your microphone.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>(BLABBERING)</p>
<p>A-ooga! (LAUGHS)</p>
<p>There you have it.</p>
<p>(SPUTTERING)</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>Homer, do something about this leak.</p>
<p>Don't worry, Marge. Hot Wheels to the rescue!</p>
<p>Water flows down here, through the straightaway, a couple of wicked S-turns, around the loop of death, and out the mail slot. Then it's the yard's problem.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: My hamster!</p>
<p>(PANTING)</p>
<p>(SQUEAKING)</p>
<p>(SCREAMING)</p>
<p>You know, Homer, I let a lot of things slide.</p>
<p>But when you can't keep a roof over your family's head, you're just not much of a father.</p>
<p>I was gonna have my classmates over for a homework party.</p>
<p>But now my refreshments are ruined.</p>
<p>Goodbye, college!</p>
<p>He was supposed to be in a show-and-tell this week!</p>
<p>(SNEEZES)</p>
<p>That's not gonna happen.</p>
<p>That teddy bear survived three safety recalls, but it couldn't survive you!</p>
<p>Oh, that's it! I'm going to Moe's!</p>
<p>Aw! It's raining outside!</p>
<p>It's raining inside!</p>
<p>(MEWLING)</p>
<p>Lousy cat!</p>
<p>(SLAMS)</p>
<p>Stupid Homer-hating family.</p>
<p>At least there's one place I'm always welcome.</p>
<p>(Men) <em>(SINGING) For he's a jolly good fellow...</em></p>
<p>Oh, guys. This is just what I needed.</p>
<p>This ain't for you, sweat stain.</p>
<p>It's a surprise party for Lenny thrown by his closest friends.</p>
<p>So what's Stephen Hawking doing here?</p>
<p><em>(ON VOICE SYNTHESIZER) I live here now.</p>
<p>You're looking at the new owner of the Little Caesars down the street.</p>
<p>Pizza, pizza. Pizza, pizza. Pizza, pizza. Pizza, pizza.</p>
<p>Sorry, that button sticks.</em></p>
<p>So why didn't you invite me?</p>
<p>We couldn't tell you ahead of time because you'd spill the beans.</p>
<p>I wouldn't ruin a surprise for Lenny.</p>
<p>Surprise? What surprise?</p>
<p>(BLOWING HORNS)</p>
<p>(ALL GROAN)</p>
<p>Way to go, Homer.</p>
<p>Ugh! That's six years planning down the drain!</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I'll just sit over here until you stop being mad at me.</p>
<p>Oh, great, Homer!</p>
<p>I bake a cake shaped like Lenny's favorite barstool, and you wreck it!</p>
<p>Well, I can see I'm not wanted here.</p>
<p>Wait, Homer. Don't go.</p>
<p>Okay, b*at it!</p>
<p>Who wants ass frosting?</p>
<p><em>No, thanks. I'm on Atkins.</em></p>
<p>My family hates me.</p>
<p>My stupid friends kick me out of their stupid party.</p>
<p>They'll all be sorry when I invent the world's best-tasting cola.</p>
<p>And share it with no one!</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>(GASPS) A sign!</p>
<p>Finally, a bar for men who like to drink and look at sexy women.</p>
<p>Welcome to Knockers, hon.</p>
<p>Let me know if you see anything you like.</p>
<p>Read the sign, prevert!</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: D'oh!</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>I'd like a beer and a sympathetic ear.</p>
<p>I got my own problems.</p>
<p>I just lost this eye last night.</p>
<p>How did it ever come to this?</p>
<p>I'm the first man ever to feel depressed in a bar.</p>
<p>I don't have a friend in the world.</p>
<p>Look at the size of that nacho plate!</p>
<p>I haven't seen this much melted cheese since I left my Billy Joel albums out in the sun.</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>The sun.</p>
<p>Hey, you want to split this?</p>
<p>Wow. It's been so long since I've been with someone who doesn't know what a selfish pig I am.</p>
<p>Mine. Move your hand.</p>
<p>I get this.</p>
<p>Hey, my name's Ray. Ray Magini.</p>
<p>Ray, you know me better than anyone.</p>
<p>How can I get my wife to love me again?</p>
<p>b*at me. I'm no marriage counselor.</p>
<p>Just a licensed and bonded roofer.</p>
<p>(GASPS) Ray, will you help me fix my roof?</p>
<p>Sure, I'll help you.</p>
<p>Under one condition.</p>
<p>You gotta help me finish this pitcher of beer.</p>
<p>Wait. Did I add that right?</p>
<p>Now for my first act as President...</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>(SHATTERING)</p>
<p>(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)</p>
<p>Deal! To my new buddy!</p>
<p>Now all we need is an awesome theme song.</p>
<p>Whatever plays next on the jukebox.</p>
<p>Deal.</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: <em>(SINGING) Do that to me one more time.</p>
<p>Once is never enough with a man like you</em></p>
<p>Next song. Uh, yeah, that's what I meant.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>(HOMER SNORING)</p>
<p>Homer! I woke up to find an owl eating a mouse on the pillow next to me.</p>
<p>I think that means six more weeks of autumn.</p>
<p>It means you have to fix the roof.</p>
<p>Don't worry, honey. I found us a roofer last night.</p>
<p>And you'll never guess where.</p>
<p>Knockers on Route 98.</p>
<p>How did you know?</p>
<p>I'm psychic.</p>
<p>Look, I don't know if I want a roofer who hangs out in bars.</p>
<p>(SCOFFS) You're right, Marge.</p>
<p>I guess I should look for roofers at poetry slams and yoga retreats.</p>
<p>High five! Nah.</p>
<p>I got standards. I don't hand out high-fives like Chiclets.</p>
<p>Ray would high five me.</p>
<p>Well, he'd better high five our roof! Huh?</p>
<p>Yay, Mom!</p>
<p>Zing! D'oh!</p>
<p>Come on, kids. We're gonna visit Grampa.</p>
<p>Then we're gonna take the dog to the V-E-T.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Then take Bart to get C-I-R-C-U-M-C-I-S-E-D.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Uh, I'll tell you what it means when it's over.</p>
<p>Hey, Homer. Oh, Ray.</p>
<p>You came at the agreed-upon time!</p>
<p>That's what I like about you, Homer. Everything impresses you.</p>
<p>&quot;Impresses,&quot; what a big word.</p>
<p>I'm gonna look that up.</p>
<p>Ah... This is gonna take some work.</p>
<p>Tell me, was the roof in good condition when you bought the house?</p>
<p>I didn't really check. I mainly bought this house for the view.</p>
<p>Someday that bowl will overflow, and I'll be there.</p>
<p>Okay, kids.</p>
<p>We only have time for a quick visit to Grampa.</p>
<p>So as soon as he feels loved, we're out of there.</p>
<p>(BARKING)</p>
<p>Oh, he must smell leftovers.</p>
<p>Please. We call them senior citizens.</p>
<p>Oh, look!</p>
<p>(ALL COOING)</p>
<p>A dog? What a nice surprise. I'm gonna pet you raw!</p>
<p>(GRUNTS AFFECTIONATELY)</p>
<p>(ALL CHEERING)</p>
<p>Can we keep your dog, please?</p>
<p>Keep my dog? Till when?</p>
<p>Not too long. Just till we die.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Well, he does seem happy here.</p>
<p>Also, gerontological studies have demonstrated that animal companions can slow the inevitable decline of...</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, thank you.</p>
<p>Why don't you go find a parade and rain on it?</p>

<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>One, two, three, four! I declare a nail w*r!</p>
<p>This is why I got into roofing!</p>
<p>(BOTH LAUGHING)</p>
<p>(Ned) Hey, Homer!</p>
<p>Ned, are you okay?</p>
<p>Yeah. But my mower can't get much lower.</p>
<p>(AIR HISSING)</p>
<p>I was wrong! (WHIMPERS)</p>
<p>(DOOR SLAMS)</p>
<p>(BOTH LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Ah, that's Ned Flanders.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>There's one in every neighborhood.</p>
<p>(PAGER BEEPING)</p>
<p>Oh, sorry, man. I gotta go.</p>
<p>This says my kid attempted something.</p>
<p>I hate the way these things cut off.</p>
<p>Goodbye, Ray! Bye!</p>
<p>Oh, he turned a corner.</p>
<p>Ooh! Now I see him again!</p>
<p>(CRASHING)</p>
<p>(SCREAMS)</p>
<p>(SNORING)</p>
<p>Homer! Huh? Huh?</p>
<p>You're drooling on my Goodwill pile!</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>And why is the hole in the roof even bigger?</p>
<p>Don't worry. Ray'll be back any minute.</p>
<p>It's after 6:00! He's not coming back!</p>
<p>He's a lousy roofer and a flake!</p>
<p>Hey, watch what you say about him!</p>
<p>I think Ray could be the one.</p>
<p>The one what?</p>
<p>My new best friend!</p>
<p>We think alike, we act alike, we finish each other's sandwiches.</p>
<p>I don't want to hear any more about Ray!</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning you buy some shingles and fix that roof yourself!</p>
<p>Ray's not gonna like that.</p>
<p>You're not married to Ray!</p>
<p>Well, if I was, we'd have taller kids!</p>
<p>I'm sure everyone's happier with Santa's Little Helper here to love them.</p>
<p>Yeah. I bet the old people will be acting like young people, like in those cell phone ads everyone hates.</p>
<p>(BARKS WEAKLY)</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>He's become one of them!</p>
<p>Hey, boy. Want a treat?</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>Better get you home. Come on, Lisa.</p>
<p>Right after Pat Sajak.</p>
<p>Oh! Jeez, Louise!</p>
<p>(BOTH WHINING)</p>
<p>You know, it's too bad.</p>
<p>We've had that dog as long as I can remember.</p>
<p>What dog? Who the hell are you?</p>
<p>I wish I knew.</p>
<p>You know, son, my dad used to take me down to Johnson's Hardware.</p>
<p>Old man Johnson knew everything about fixing stuff.</p>
<p>When they built this place, he hung himself.</p>
<p>(STRAINING)</p>
<p>Oh, sorry, son. I wanted you to bring me the stack of tiles from the top shelf.</p>
<p>Hey, Ray's here!</p>
<p>Hey, Homer! Look, I just came down with a case of shingles.</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>What's in the box?</p>
<p>Hey, I'm real sorry I never made it back yesterday.</p>
<p>I hope we're still friends.</p>
<p>Of course we are. Uh...</p>
<p>If you want to be?</p>
<p>Well, I want to be, if you want to be.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what, let me get a few more supplies, and I'll come ﬂght over and I'll finish your roof!</p>
<p>Hey, Dad. Remember when you said if I used a chainsaw unsupervised, I'd hurt myself?</p>
<p>Well, you were wrong. I hurt someone else.</p>
<p>Oh! I have 45 minutes to get ready for the prom!</p>
<p>What are you doing? Why aren't you fixing the roof?</p>
<p>I don't have to. Ray's gonna be here any minute.</p>
<p>(GRUNTS) I am so sick of hearing about that stupid, unreliable Ray, who, by the way, I have never even met!</p>
<p>All right. Then you can just look at the portrait I painted of him.</p>
<p>Homer, how did you think I'd feel when I saw that?</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>Uh! Uh! Oh...</p>
<p>Oh! Uh! Oh...</p>
<p>Oh! Oh...</p>
<p>Homer, come down for dinner.</p>
<p>Did you make enough for Ray?</p>
<p>Oh! Ray's not coming!</p>
<p>He is, too!</p>
<p>His truck's gonna come around the corner right now.</p>
<p>Right now! Right now! Now!</p>
<p>Now!</p>
<p>(MUTTERS)</p>
<p>Now!</p>
<p>(SHIVERING)</p>
<p>(SHAKILY) Now. Now.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>Homer, I know where Ray is.</p>
<p>Oh, thank God. Where is he? Tell me!</p>
<p>Sweetheart, your friend, Ray is in your head.</p>
<p>Ray wouldn't fit in my head. He's a human man.</p>
<p>(SIGHS)</p>
<p>You have to understand.</p>
<p>Ray doesn't exist.</p>
<p>Yes, he does. He's on his way.</p>
<p>And when he gets here, we'll have ever so much fun.</p>
<p>You'll see. (LAUGHING)</p>
<p>We'll laugh! (SCREAMS)</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>(GASPS) Homer!</p>
<p>(LAUGHING WEAKLY)</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>What? What's going on? Where are my shoes?</p>
<p>(STRAINING)</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>Struggle all you want, Homer.</p>
<p>There's nothing you can do.</p>
<p>(HOCKS AND SPITS)</p>
<p>Why... Excuse us for a moment.</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>What am I doing here? Let me go!</p>
<p>We'll let you go when you admit there is no Ray Magini.</p>
<p>Fine, I admit it.</p>
<p>Help me, Ray! Appear and strike them down!</p>
<p>Homer, no one has ever seen Ray but you.</p>
<p>But that's not true. Bart saw him at the Builder's Barn.</p>
<p>No, I didn't, Dad.</p>
<p><em>I saw you talking to yourself.</em></p>
<p>Flanders, you saw Ray on the roof with me!</p>
<p>Sorry, Homer. You'll have to call me a &quot;Ray-theist&quot; because I don't believe I saw him.</p>
<p>Ned, are you okay?</p>
<p>There has to be someone who saw him.</p>
<p>Someone who doesn't hate me, like Flanders and Bart. (GASPS)</p>
<p>Wait! The bartender at Knockers!</p>
<p>I called that bosom bar.</p>
<p>The bartender said you were there alone.</p>
<p>Ray's a figment of your imagination, Homer.</p>
<p>You felt lonely and unappreciated, so you made him up.</p>
<p>And here's the clincher.</p>
<p>&quot;Ray Magini&quot; is an anagram for &quot;imaginary.&quot;</p>
<p>Wow. My subconscious is a genius.</p>
<p>Well, that's all very convincing and...</p>
<p>(THUDDING)</p>
<p>(BLABBERS)</p>
<p>He's right over there!</p>
<p>Hey, come on! Can't anybody see him?</p>
<p>(BLABBERING)</p>
<p>You can only see from my point of view.</p>
<p>I'm afraid this calls for electroshock.</p>
<p>(GASPS) Electroshock?</p>
<p>Actually, the technical term is electroconvulsive therapy.</p>
<p>Well, that's a world of difference. Light me up, Doc!</p>
<p>When you're getting juiced, can you hold my turtle?</p>
<p>I want to bring him back to life.</p>
<p>Aw... What did he die of?</p>
<p>I don't know. He was dead when I found him.</p>
<p>(WHIMPERING)</p>
<p>Homer, that's just to bite on, not to eat.</p>
<p>Sorry. Give me one that doesn't taste so good.</p>
<p>That was rubber covered in Vaseline!</p>
<p>Marge, write that down so we can have it at home.</p>
<p>We can't begin his treatment soon enough.</p>
<p>(MACHINE WHIRS)</p>
<p>(ELECTRICAL CRACKLING)</p>
<p>(SCREAMS)</p>
<p>(HISSING)</p>
<p>(BLABBERING)</p>
<p>How you feeling, sweetie?</p>
<p>Much better.</p>
<p>Do you see anyone here who isn't here?</p>
<p>Nope. Just you, Marge, and Yogi Bear.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES) Kidding!</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES) Well, I see your sense of humor's not affected.</p>
<p>That's a very bad sign.</p>
<p>(WHIRS)</p>
<p>(ELECTRICAL CRACKLING)</p>
<p>(SCREAMS)</p>
<p>Real.</p>
<p>Not real.</p>
<p>Real. Real.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry, Homer. But recent historical evidence indicates that Robin Hood did not actually exist.</p>
<p>(ELECTRICAL CRACKLING)</p>
<p>(SCREAMS)</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>You kids can relax. Your father is fine now.</p>
<p>Fine and dandy?</p>
<p>Well, his dandiness will slowly return with time.</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p>Oh, kids, I heart you, too.</p>
<p>Man, I'm glad to be off that electroshock table.</p>
<p>Although, to be honest, I did enjoy lying down.</p>
<p>Hello, Homer.</p>
<p>(GASPS) It's Ray! I see him again!</p>
<p>Monster, you don't exist!</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>Hey, no one calls me a monster and questions my existence!</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>The awesome power of the human mind.</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>I see Ray, too.</p>
<p>So do I. Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not worried.</p>
<p>You've already agreed not to sue me for anything.</p>
<p>When did I agree to that?</p>
<p>You did when I validated your parking.</p>
<p>You didn't validate my parking.</p>
<p>Check and mate.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>So Ray does exist?</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>Now let's explore the improbable series of events that led to this amusing yet tragic farce.</p>
<p>On account of my eye patch, I couldn't see Ray sitting at the bar.</p>
<p><em>All I saw was you eating and drinking and talking to yourself.</em></p>
<p>And, Ned, you didn't see me because I was hiding behind the chimney.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES) Gee, I thought my vision was perfect, and here I was worshipping false eyeballs.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>How come at Builder's Barn, I saw Homer talking to thin air.</p>
<p>Well, that... Hmm.</p>
<p>(Hawking)<em> I can answer that.</p>
<p>I've been tracking a tear in the fabric of space-time, which combined with airborne pieces of metal at Builder's Barn to create a miniature black hole.</p>
<p>This anomaly interposed itself between Homer and Bart causing a gravitational lens, which absorbed the light reflected from Ray the roofer.</em></p>
<p>That seems feasible.</p>
<p>(ALL CHEERING)</p>
<p>Wait. There's still one last thing that doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Why did you start fixing our roof and then just disappear?</p>
<p>That's easy. I'm a contractor.</p>
<p>(ALL LAUGHING)</p>
<p>That's right. You're all crooks.</p>
<p>(ALL LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we're all crooks. It's true.</p>
<p>(LAUGHS)</p>
<p>Hey, wait a minute!</p>
<p>I went through a lot of pain and suffering because of this &quot;little misunderstanding.&quot;</p>
<p>Somebody owes me big.</p>
<p>Well, Homer, I could make it up to you.</p>
<p>Maybe a free eye-scraping.</p>
<p>That's a given. There's something else.</p>
<p>Something much more else.</p>
<p>Homer, can I please knock off?</p>
<p>I've got surgery in the morning.</p>
<p>Not if those gutters aren't clean, you don't.</p>
<p>(MUTTERS)</p>
<p>So as I was saying, Homer, Mondays, 9:00, CBS.</p>
<p>They say everybody loves that guy, but I don't get it.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Hey, I'm just saying, catch it while you still can.</p>
<p>(BOTH CHUCKLING)</p>
<p>(Hawking) <em>Badda-bing, badda-boom. And we're done.</em></p>
