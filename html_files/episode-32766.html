<p>D'oh!  </p>
<p>(tires screeching)  </p>
<p>(grunts)  </p>
<p>(trumpets)  </p>
<p>(croaking)   </p>
<p>George, I'm sorry to see you up here.   </p>
<p>Well, yes, but I died for a worthy cause.   </p>
<p>As we speak, my body is about to be dissected by a budding young scientist.   </p>
<p>Let's observe the dedication to learning of this ten-year-old scholar by the name of Bart Simpson.   </p>
<p>♪ Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab, die ♪   </p>
<p>♪ Stab, stab, die, die, death, k*ll. ♪   </p>
<p>Well, his passion is undeniable.   </p>
<p>Yes, very... very impressive.   </p>
<p>By examining my specimen's pyloric sphincter valve,   </p>
<p>I deduced that she had an affinity for fruit flies.   </p>
<p>By examining my specimen's natty dreads, I was able to deduce that he was a jammin' Rasta-frogian.   </p>
<p>My body, my little green body.   </p>
<p>Okay, but surely his portrayal of Rastafarianism will be culturally sensitive.   </p>
<p>Pass the Dutchie.   </p>
<p>We be smokin' slabba slabba with the Babylon.   </p>
<p>Ribbit, ribbit, mon.   </p>
<p>(panting loudly)   </p>
<p>Come now, George.   </p>
<p>At least this Scottish groundskeeper will give your remains a respectful burial.   </p>
<p>WILLIE: Into the crapper you go, useless froggy garbage.   </p>
<p>(toilet flushing)   </p>
<p>Are you going to put a good spin on that, too?   </p>
<p>Hmm? Are you?!   </p>
<p>Well, are you?   </p>
<p>Well, uh... ribbit?   </p>
<p>MARGE: I can't put these grades on the refrigerator.   </p>
<p>I can't even put them on the garage refrigerator.   </p>
<p>It's not my fault.   </p>
<p>- I blame &quot;so-key-ity.&quot;<br />
- What?!   </p>
<p>You know, so-key-ity.   </p>
<p>That's what everyone blames for everything.   </p>
<p>You mean &quot;society&quot;?   </p>
<p>- Yeah, that's the guy.<br />
- Honey,   </p>
<p>I know you're a bright boy, but if you don't try harder in school, you could end up...   </p>
<p>...not a success.   </p>
<p>Oh, that. Don't worry, Mom.   </p>
<p>As long as I can stand on a corner and spin a sign reading &quot;new condos,&quot;   </p>
<p>I'll be just fine.   </p>
<p>(groaning)   </p>
<p>(Marge groaning)   </p>
<p>(Marge groaning)   </p>
<p>All that pacing isn't gonna fix the boy.   </p>
<p>Just get him some pills.   </p>
<p>Two pinks and a blue, and it's off to the races.   </p>
<p>Everything we've tried with Bart has failed.   </p>
<p>What if there's nothing we can do?   </p>
<p>Mm, &quot;nothing we can do&quot; is a whole lot better than &quot;it'll take all we've got.&quot;   </p>
<p>I wonder if anyone talks about parenting online.   </p>
<p>Look at this one!   </p>
<p>HOMER: They're skiing.   </p>
<p>Skiing means happy.   </p>
<p>Hmm, an expert with a new book to promote.   </p>
<p>Oh, I wonder if she'd be willing to speak to a group for a fee.   </p>
<p>Getting your child established on the path to success isn't easy.   </p>
<p>I was driving my daughter from her falconry tournament to lute class when she turned to me asked...   </p>
<p>(speaks Mandarin)   </p>
<p>...which is Mandarin for, &quot;How do you do it?&quot;   </p>
<p>She and I are learning Mandarin.   </p>
<p>The answer? (speaks Mandarin)   </p>
<p>Positive reinforcement.   </p>
<p>(inquisitive chatter)   </p>
<p>In a recent study, this mouse was denied food whenever he failed to find his way through a maze.   </p>
<p>The mouse ended up dying... of low self-esteem.   </p>
<p>(shocked and excited chatter)   </p>
<p>I had a nightmare where that happened to Bart, but I never told you about it.   </p>
<p>I love it when you don't tell me things.   </p>
<p>This mouse was given food whether he got through the maze or not.   </p>
<p>And this fall, he'll be in a lab at Harvard.   </p>
<p>(excited gasps and chatter)   </p>
<p>Low self-esteem can cripple your child's chances of success.   </p>
<p>The cure: praise.   </p>
<p>(excited chatter)   </p>
<p>Praise they can hold in their hands.   </p>
<p>Certificates, ribbons and, yes, even trophies.   </p>
<p>(crowd gasps)   </p>
<p>(gasps) Trophies.    </p>
<p>So that's the easy answer.    </p>
<p>If Ralphie's shelf says he's a winner, then he'll be one!    </p>
<p>And Moe yells a third thing to feel part of the group!    </p>
<p>Yes! Trophies-- that's what Bart needs.    </p>
<p>This is how we save him.    </p>
<p>(scoffs) Give Bart a trophy? What for?    </p>
<p>Most boogers wiped on a bedroom wall?    </p>
<p>They're giving trophies for that now?    </p>
<p>I weep for this country.    </p>
<p>Bart's future is at stake.    </p>
<p>Besides, I'm tired of Springfield missing out on every parenting trend, like the time-out and the diaper.    </p>
<p>I never got a trophy when I was a kid, and I turned out just...    </p>
<p>(gulping)    </p>
<p>(slowly): ...fine.    </p>
<p>He's my son, and he's getting a trophy for nothing.    </p>
<p>You hear me? For nothing!    </p>
<p>Huh. Huh?    </p>
<p>(screams)    </p>
<p>Good morning.    </p>
<p>How's my special little winner?    </p>
<p>How'd you get that thing in my bed without waking me up?    </p>
<p>Because you're a champion sleeper.    </p>
<p>It's the craziest thing.    </p>
<p>She will not give up on that kid.    </p>
<p>Trophies<em> can</em> boost self-esteem.    </p>
<p>If you actually win them, like I did.    </p>
<p>But what's the point of just handing out unearned statues?    </p>
<p>And statuettes.    </p>
<p>Well, it's just a waste of gullible parents' money.    </p>
<p>(echoing):<em> Waste of gullible parents' money.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Gullible parents' money.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Money. Money.</em>    </p>
<p>(bell dings) Hmm.    </p>
<p>Step right up! Every kid's a winner!    </p>
<p>The more you spend, the more you love!    </p>
<p>Mm-hmm.    </p>
<p>I thought you agreed that trophies should be earned.    </p>
<p>I'm earning nature's trophy: money.    </p>
<p>(wind whistles softly)    </p>
<p>Remember, folks.    </p>
<p>Nothing but a genuine Trophyland trophy says to your kids that...    </p>
<p>HOMER: ♪ You're the best around ♪    </p>
<p>♪ Nothing's gonna ever keep you down ♪    </p>
<p>♪ You're the best around ♪    </p>
<p>♪ Nothing's gonna ever keep you down ♪    </p>
<p>♪ You're the best around ♪    </p>
<p>♪ Nothing's gonna ever keep you down ♪    </p>
<p>♪ You're the best around ♪    </p>
<p>♪ Nothing's gonna ♪    </p>
<p>♪ Ever keep you down ♪    </p>
<p>♪ You're the best around ♪    </p>
<p>♪ Nothing's gonna ever keep you down ♪    </p>
<p>♪ You're the best. ♪    </p>
<p>(chuckles) These stupid, loving parents will buy trophies for any accomplishment.    </p>
<p>Not wetting the bed, using your inside voice, even &quot;go watch TV in the other room.&quot;    </p>
<p>I still think these things are good for their self-esteem.    </p>
<p>Not to mention the self-esteem that comes from wad riffling.    </p>
<p>(wind whistles softly)    </p>
<p>Look, I even put the boy to work.    </p>
<p>Well, then he should get a trophy for that.    </p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!    </p>
<p>We have a saying in the participation trophy business.    </p>
<p>&quot;Don't get high-- self-esteem-- on your own supply-- of self-esteem.&quot;    </p>
<p>I don't care. I'm giving him this.    </p>
<p>What? Why did it break?    </p>
<p>The parts are of the highest quality.    </p>
<p>They come from the China of China: India.    </p>
<p>Boy, did you glue this trophy together with bubblegum?    </p>
<p>Eh, sticky is sticky. I'm taking my break.    </p>
<p>HOMER: See? Giving him trophies did nothing.    </p>
<p>You've showered him with praise, and he's just as lazy as ever.    </p>
<p>Shh! What if he heard you say that?    </p>
<p>Hey, if Bart is as bad at eavesdropping as he is at everything else, we've got nothing to worry about.    </p>
<p>I say we keep talking loudly.    </p>
<p>But what about his confidence?    </p>
<p>Face it. Our son is a screw-up.    </p>
<p>He was born a screw-up, and no matter how hard he tries--    </p>
<p>which he never will--    </p>
<p>Bart will<em> always</em> be a screw-up.    </p>
<p>(groans)    </p>
<p>And have you ever heard that sound he makes when he's sad?    </p>
<p>Pathetic.    </p>
<p>(sighs)    </p>
<p>Queen's bishop Lomotil takes king's Ativan.    </p>
<p>Oh, looks like I'll be having a panic attack on the toilet tonight.    </p>
<p>(scoffs) Look at that whimpering little crybaby.    </p>
<p>(mocking): Wah! Wah!    </p>
<p>Abe, that's your grandson.    </p>
<p>Come visit me!    </p>
<p>I'm so lonely!    </p>
<p>(crying): Wah! Wah!    </p>
<p>What's got you down, kiddo?    </p>
<p>My dad says I'm terrible at everything.    </p>
<p>Oh, he's just repeating what he heard as a boy from me.    </p>
<p>Oh, I was an awful father, just like my old man.    </p>
<p>Your dad didn't believe in you, either?    </p>
<p>It wasn't his fault.    </p>
<p>He was just focused on his career as a professional b*at.    </p>
<p><em>Men would come from five towns over</em>    </p>
<p><em>to study my father's technique.</em>    </p>
<p><em>But no matter how many strangles he patented,</em>    </p>
<p><em>his father never approved.</em>    </p>
<p>(choking loudly)    </p>
<p>Even if only a little bit of that really happened, I'll never escape being a loser.    </p>
<p>That's loser talk!    </p>
<p>You're a great kid, and I'm gonna prove it to you.    </p>
<p>Boy, this here's a real trophy.    </p>
<p>Our family's most prized possession: a Baumont Chrono-master Elite.    </p>
<p>It's been a Simpson heirloom ever since it was stolen off a dead body at Gettysburg.    </p>
<p>In     .    </p>
<p>Whoa!    </p>
<p>Wait. Is this just another gold shiny thing to trick me into feeling special when I'm not?    </p>
<p>You are special!    </p>
<p>You're like my prostate-- a spiky little troublemaker who plays by his own rules.    </p>
<p>You don't take hooey from Louis.    </p>
<p>Never have, never will.    </p>
<p>(shudders)    </p>
<p>I feel something.    </p>
<p>It's like a sunburn on the inside.    </p>
<p>It's called &quot;pride.&quot;    </p>
<p>Every tick will remind you you've got a grandpa who believes in you.    </p>
<p>The same way I believe the retirement home has been taken over by robots.    </p>
<p>(Eastern European accent):<br />
I am not a robot.    </p>
<p>I just have light-up sneakers.    </p>
<p>♪ ♪    </p>
<p>(Ralph humming)    </p>
<p>Why is my trophy the smallest?    </p>
<p>You all lost-- to me!    </p>
<p>(confused murmurs)    </p>
<p>Lisa, are you suggesting we engage in excellence bias?    </p>
<p>(crying): She's loser-shaming me.    </p>
<p>(growls)    </p>
<p>(students gasp)    </p>
<p>Why do you always have to make trouble, ya wee harpy?    </p>
<p>How am I supposed to stay silent when parents are just blindly chasing the latest trend?    </p>
<p>Ugh, parents.    </p>
<p>Those lazy lunch-packers.    </p>
<p>They just want to be told what to do.    </p>
<p>And there's no shortage of experts who want to tell 'em.    </p>
<p>WILLIE (echoing): <em>No shortage of experts.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Experts. Experts. Experts.</em>    </p>
<p>(bell dings)    </p>
<p>LISA; <em>Another parenting expert, eh?</em>    </p>
<p>Clearly, this is a community in the grip of an addiction to trophies.    </p>
<p>Now, parents, I warn you, too much praise creates millennials-- a generation of soft, entitled narcissists, who drop out of college to become deejays.    </p>
<p>That only pays well at the very highest levels.    </p>
<p>Instead of showering your kids with gifts, you should prod them to greatness with GRIT.    </p>
<p>Get up. Retry.    </p>
<p>I don't care if you're...    </p>
<p>Tired.    </p>
<p>He's got a word made of other words.    </p>
<p>(chuckles) He must know what he's talking about.    </p>
<p>Oh, it is an end to praise.    </p>
<p>Praise Vishnu.    </p>
<p>(crowd exclaims, murmurs)    </p>
<p>Remember, GRIT also stands for: Get Rid of Idiotic Trophies.    </p>
<p>Another word word! He did it again!    </p>
<p>Why does the word &quot;of&quot; sometimes count in the acronym and sometimes not?    </p>
<p>Shut up, Mel! Your kids live in Nebraska with your mom.    </p>
<p>CROWD (chanting): No more trophies!<br />
No more trophies!    </p>
<p>Uh-oh.    </p>
<p>You are scum, sir!    </p>
<p>- (crowd booing)<br />
- Burn in hell!    </p>
<p>k*ll him with GRIT!    </p>
<p>Hi, Homer. How's the trophy business?    </p>
<p>Nobody wants them anymore, thanks to GRIT.    </p>
<p>Stupid parenting method I can't exploit for money.    </p>
<p>Actually kinda makes sense.    </p>
<p>Hate it so much.    </p>
<p>(Homer gasps)    </p>
<p>I know that.    </p>
<p>That's my dad's old pocket watch.    </p>
<p>How did you get it?    </p>
<p>Oh, Grampa said I earned it.    </p>
<p>I guess someone in this family's proud of me.    </p>
<p>Oh, you didn't want it, did you?    </p>
<p>(scoffs) Yeah, right.    </p>
<p>That watch means nothing to me.    </p>
<p>Really? Then how do you explain that case you made?    </p>
<p>I built it to always remind me of what not to want.    </p>
<p>What about your self-published novel?    </p>
<p>Well, the character of John Homer is only partly based on me.    </p>
<p>Well, if I didn't know better, I'd say you were obsessed with getting Grampa's watch.    </p>
<p>Ooh, thanks for the analysis, Dr. Freud.    </p>
<p>Next you'll be telling me that this whole trophy business, and in fact, all my get-rich-quick schemes over the years, are born of a desperate need for approval from a father who couldn't show love.    </p>
<p>Likely because of his traumatic relationship with his own father, and his before him, and so on.    </p>
<p>But, unfortunately, Dr. Freud, that couldn't be further from the truth, Doctor.    </p>
<p>If you say so.    </p>
<p>Now I'm gonna take this out and see what life is like with real love and encouragement ticking in my pocket.    </p>
<p>Stupid watch.    </p>
<p>Doesn't even have a fob.    </p>
<p>Bart, where's the fob?    </p>
<p>Bart, you look like a fool!    </p>

<p>Okay, Milhouse, I'll drop a rock, you watch it come down.    </p>
<p>That should be where Grampa's watch landed.    </p>
<p>- (thud)<br />
- MILHOUSE: Ow!    </p>
<p>Did you see where the rock landed?    </p>
<p>In my eye!    </p>
<p>Oh. That watch was the only thing that made me not terrible.    </p>
<p>I can't lose it.    </p>
<p>I'll drop another rock a few feet to the left.    </p>
<p>My other eye!    </p>
<p>Ow!    </p>
<p>Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!    </p>
<p>Not a single one has missed me!    </p>
<p>What are you doing?    </p>
<p>That expert at the school said trophies are bad for kids.    </p>
<p>It's all part of GRIT.    </p>
<p>No, no.    </p>
<p>My trophies were earned.    </p>
<p>Even the soccer one?    </p>
<p>I went to most of the practices.    </p>
<p>Yeah, but what happens when another parenting expert comes along with a whole new theory on self-esteem?    </p>
<p>Another expert?    </p>
<p>Who are they? What are they saying?    </p>
<p>Aw.    </p>
<p>Okay, the watch is gone.    </p>
<p>I guess I can live with being a useless, worthless nothing as long as no one finds out.    </p>
<p>Sweetie, your grampa's on the phone.    </p>
<p>Hello.    </p>
<p>Great news, kiddo.    </p>
<p><em>Remember That</em> magazine is putting out their annual family heirlooms issue.    </p>
<p>They want us for the cover.    </p>
<p>You, me and the pocket watch.    </p>
<p>Um...    </p>
<p>It's a great story.    </p>
<p>Passing a beloved heirloom from grandfather to grandson.    </p>
<p>A gift that restored a child's faith in himself.    </p>
<p>Uh, Grampa, there's something I have to tell you.    </p>
<p>Hold on one second.    </p>
<p>I'm just finishing up a mandatory pre-article heart exam.    </p>
<p>Doc says as long as I don't suffer any major disappointments, I'll be fine.    </p>
<p>Now, what did you want to tell me?    </p>
<p>Uh, helmets ruined football.    </p>
<p>Exactly! If you want to protect your head, grow your hair long.    </p>
<p>Anyway, I'll see you tomorrow at   :   a.m.    </p>
<p>And you won't be late because you've got that watch.    </p>
<p>(groans)    </p>
<p>Stupid parenting experts.    </p>
<p>Why don't they write a book called<em> Stop Buying These Books?</em>    </p>
<p>Everybody'd buy that.    </p>
<p>Even if I was listening to what you said, it doesn't matter; nothing matters.    </p>
<p>My trophy business has failed and Bart has the thing I wanted most:    </p>
<p>Grampa's watch.    </p>
<p>What watch?    </p>
<p>The one you get for being a success.    </p>
<p>Well, then I should have it.    </p>
<p>Uh, that never really came up.    </p>
<p>All that's left to do now is bring these to the needy.    </p>
<p>Best I can do is charge you ten dollars to throw them in my Dumpster.    </p>
<p>How about I give you a trophy that says &quot;Best Pawn Shop&quot;?    </p>
<p>Not unless I earned it.    </p>
<p>(gasps)    </p>
<p>Dad's watch!    </p>
<p>Hey, dirtbag shopkeep.    </p>
<p>How did this come to you?    </p>
<p>Mm. Some kid brought it in.    </p>
<p>Said he was mad at his friend for dropping so many rocks in his eye.    </p>
<p>That dude's seen a lot of living.    </p>
<p>Yours for    bucks.    </p>
<p>That's an insult.    </p>
<p>You're talking about a self-worth-boosting antique that's been in my family for generations.    </p>
<p>Twenty-two?    </p>
<p>You'll take it all and you'll like it.    </p>
<p>(maniacal laugh)    </p>
<p>Yes. I have it.    </p>
<p>Some said it would never happen.    </p>
<p>Most were unaware of the situation.    </p>
<p>But I finally have my father's watch!    </p>
<p>(maniacal laugh)    </p>
<p>(singsongy): Oh, Bart, look what Daddy's got now.    </p>
<p>(Bart crying)    </p>
<p>Grampa was the only person who believed in me.    </p>
<p>But when he finds out I lost the watch, even he'll give up.    </p>
<p>(sobbing)    </p>
<p>Stay strong, Homer.    </p>
<p>Don't go soft on him now.    </p>
<p>This is a once-in-a-lifetime face-rubbing-in.    </p>
<p>Mm. Come on, foot.    </p>
<p>Kick, damn you!    </p>
<p>(grunts)    </p>
<p>(sighs) Son, I found something that belongs to you.    </p>
<p>(gasps) Grampa's watch!    </p>
<p>No. I can't take it.    </p>
<p>I didn't earn it, so I don't deserve it.    </p>
<p>You were right.    </p>
<p>I am a screwup.    </p>
<p>But, boy, who screwed you up?    </p>
<p>(gasps) You.    </p>
<p>It was you.    </p>
<p>And those who came before.    </p>
<p>(choking loudly)    </p>
<p>It's stuck in your hand fat.    </p>
<p>Oh. You got to wedge something in there to break the vacuum.    </p>
<p>(grunting)    </p>
<p>Okay.    </p>
<p>Smile, my little watch watcher.    </p>
<p>(camera clicking)    </p>
<p>That was a nice thing you did.    </p>
<p>Which parenting guide told you to do it?    </p>
<p>Well, baby, sometimes you just got to trust your gut.    </p>
<p>(watch shatters)    </p>
<p>(choking)</p>
