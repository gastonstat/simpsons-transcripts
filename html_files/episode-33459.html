<p> Joan MirÃ³'s The Poetess, going once, going twice, sold.</p>
<p> To billionaire tech mogul Megan Matheson.</p>
<p> - Hmph.</p>
<p> - [SHUDDERS]</p>
<p> [GROANS]</p>
<p> [GROWLS]</p>
<p> Don't take that painting, I love it!</p>
<p> I won't let you take it!</p>
<p> There you have it, Ms.</p>
<p> Matheson, Joan MirÃ³'s The Poetess.</p>
<p> [GASPS]</p>
<p> My painting's been stolen.</p>
<p> That's impossible.</p>
<p> It's a mystery so baffling, only one man can solve it.</p>
<p> Get me Manacek.</p>
<p> [RINGING]</p>
<p> [BANACEK THEME SONG PLAYING]</p>
<p> Thank goodness you're here, Mr. Manacek.</p>
<p> You're the best freelance insurance investigator in the business.</p>
<p> Oh, well, isn't that just what we need?</p>
<p> Some smug pretty boy out to make us cops look stupid.</p>
<p> Ah, Clancy, you're looking well - fed.</p>
<p> - Uh see?</p>
<p> He put that pause between those two words deliberately.</p>
<p> Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.</p>
<p> Well, two can play at that pause.</p>
<p> Three people bid on the stolen painting: nuclear magnate Mr.</p>
<p> Burns, venture capitalist Megan Matheson and mini golf cheat Homer Simpson.</p>
<p> They're all suspects.</p>
<p> I don't mind telling you, Manacek: I hope you fall flat on your face.</p>
<p> [CHUCKLING]: Oh.</p>
<p> I hope not.</p>
<p> My mother's rather fond of it.</p>
<p> Damn your wit.</p>
<p> [SIGHS]</p>
<p> Look, Manacek, I don't know why you're talking to me.</p>
<p> It's my painting that was stolen.</p>
<p> Yes, but you insured a $15 million painting for $30 million.</p>
<p> For a woman with a head for numbers, it doesn't add up.</p>
<p> You smug son of a bitch.</p>
<p> [LAUGHS]</p>
<p> I like you, Manacek.</p>
<p> But you should be talking to the real painting thief: the man I outbid, Montgomery Burns.</p>
<p> That's quite a workout you're getting.</p>
<p> Although, I can think of a better one.</p>
<p> Sorry, but I'm in a committed relationship with the former Miss Denmark.</p>
<p> She's created a breed of mosquito that cures malaria.</p>
<p> Well, if she invents a cure for commitment, let me know.</p>
<p> Pull.</p>
<p> sh**t.</p>
<p> Nice sh*t, Mr. Burns.</p>
<p> You're a natural in the ancient art of skeet.</p>
<p> Oh, spare me your flattery, Manacek.</p>
<p> I know why you're here.</p>
<p> You think I stole that ridiculous painting.</p>
<p> Absurd.</p>
<p> A little clay pigeon told me that you couldn't stand being outbid by a woman.</p>
<p> Pull, pull, pull!</p>
<p> Looks like the only thing being hit around here is a nerve.</p>
<p> I'll blast that smile right off your smug face.</p>
<p> [LAUGHS]</p>
<p> I like you, Manacek.</p>
<p> But it's obvious who took the painting.</p>
<p> That lunatic who said he'd do anything to have it: Homer Simpson.</p>
<p> I Did you bring that with you?</p>
<p> It's inflatable.</p>
<p> I got it at Brookstone.</p>
<p> I don't know what help I can be with your case, Mr.</p>
<p> Manacek.</p>
<p> As you can see, I'm a very busy man.</p>
<p> [IMITATING BEEPING SOUNDS]</p>
<p> According to my sources Lenny you were obsessed with that painting.</p>
<p> I myself was once obsessed with a suede sports jacket with leather pockets.</p>
<p> I would have done anything to get it.</p>
<p> Even steal a painting.</p>
<p> Me?</p>
<p> Obsessed with some stupid painting?</p>
<p> That's absurd.</p>
<p> [YELPS]</p>
<p> - Is it?</p>
<p> - You're right.</p>
<p> I'd do anything to have that painting.</p>
<p> Lie, k*ll, steal.</p>
<p> Well, not k*ll.</p>
<p> But I would steal it, and then lie about it.</p>
<p> But I didn't steal it.</p>
<p> And I'm not lying.</p>
<p> Believe me, or I'll k*ll you.</p>
<p> [CHUCKLES]</p>
<p> I like you, Manacek.</p>
<p> I'll k*ll you!</p>
<p> [CHUCKLES]</p>
<p> I like you.</p>
<p> Mr. Simpson, there's more to your story than you're letting on.</p>
<p> And I'm gonna find out what.</p>
<p> Please don't.</p>
<p> [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
<p> [DOORBELL RINGS]</p>
<p> Wow.</p>
<p> The pizza delivery boys get better looking all the time.</p>
<p> I'm Homer Simpson's wife.</p>
<p> I love wives.</p>
<p> They never pester you to marry them.</p>
<p> Geez, you've got a lot of lines.</p>
<p> You will too, after I show you my corduroy sheets.</p>
<p> Mr. Manacek, my husband is a wreck.</p>
<p> Please, just give me a chance to convince you he's innocent.</p>
<p> Only if it's over dinner.</p>
<p> Uh, okay.</p>
<p> More Frito pie, Mr. Manacek?</p>
<p> [SIGHS]</p>
<p> Sure, why not?</p>
<p> If he's not guilty of stealing that painting, why is Homer cowering on the stairs, eating cereal straight from the box?</p>
<p> [WHIMPERING]</p>
<p> Well, Homer's so quick to panic.</p>
<p> It's his only flaw.</p>
<p> Marge, I need you to be straight with me.</p>
<p> Okay, I admit it, he has many flaws.</p>
<p> Thousands.</p>
<p> Flaws.</p>
<p> Everywhere, flaws.</p>
<p> Your husband doesn't really seem like a typical art lover, but he shows exquisite taste in the female form.</p>
<p> Hey, Front Pockets, quit hitting on my mom.</p>
<p> She only loves one stocky man in tight pants: our dad.</p>
<p> Sorry, I can only solve impossible crimes if I'm seducing an amazing woman.</p>
<p> It's my process.</p>
<p> I'll tell you everything I know about Homer for one of those Tiparillos.</p>
<p> No Tiparillos.</p>
<p> BOTH: [SCOFFS]</p>
<p> Women.</p>
<p> [CHUCKLES]</p>
<p> I like you, Manacek.</p>
<p> So let me clue you in on the real story about my dad and that painting.</p>
<p> Homer was chaperoning my class field trip to the art museum, and he was not happy about it.</p>
<p> Come on, come on.</p>
<p> Hurry up in there.</p>
<p> Three to a urinal.</p>
<p> No hand washing, or we'll be late for lunch.</p>
<p> [GROANS]</p>
<p> Hmm?</p>
<p> HOMER: Sheesh, look at that stupid painting.</p>
<p> What is it even supposed to be?</p>
<p> Art should be of pretty ladies, hunting dogs with dead rabbits, Bible crap and 3-D sidewalk drawings where it looks like you could fall in.</p>
<p> [WHIRRING]</p>
<p> HOMER: I get it.</p>
<p> I get it.</p>
<p> Mr. Simpson, some of the kids went to the gift shop.</p>
<p> We were only supposed to bring five dollars, but some brought more.</p>
<p> Wha-Wha What?</p>
<p> Oh, right.</p>
<p> Chaperone.</p>
<p> Hmm mmm?</p>
<p> This is warm beer.</p>
<p> That's an '07 Michelob.</p>
<p> Homer was saving it for a special occasion.</p>
<p> Mmm.</p>
<p> Yes.</p>
<p> My husband just couldn't stop thinking about that painting.</p>
<p> [LAUGHING]</p>
<p> [GIGGLES]</p>
<p> [BELCHES]</p>
<p> [HUMMING]</p>
<p> [EXHALES]</p>
<p> Wha?</p>
<p> Honey, I love a painting.</p>
<p> Oh, what is it of?</p>
<p> Grapes?</p>
<p> - No.</p>
<p> - Flowers?</p>
<p> - No.</p>
<p> - Peaches?</p>
<p> No.</p>
<p> You sure it's a painting?</p>
<p> I'm positive.</p>
<p> I touched it when no one was looking.</p>
<p> Well, there's nothing wrong with being an art lover as long as it's representational.</p>
<p> Mmm It is representational, isn't it?</p>
<p> - [GROANS]</p>
<p> - Tell me it's representational.</p>
<p> - [GROANS]</p>
<p> - What else about our marriage is a lie?</p>
<p> Are you really a licensed DJ?</p>
<p> I took the courses, but I failed the test!</p>
<p> A blue-collar Joe suddenly likes modern art?</p>
<p> That story and two bits will get you a cup of coffee.</p>
<p> What year do you think it is?</p>
<p> Hey, who's the shamus here?</p>
<p> I'm telling you, deep down, my dad is really sensitive.</p>
<p> - [HONKS SAXOPHONE]</p>
<p> - [SCREAMS]</p>
<p> [PANTING]</p>
<p> Oh, good, you're awake.</p>
<p> You're the only one I can talk to about this.</p>
<p> I know that painting.</p>
<p> It's called The Poetess by Joan MirÃ³.</p>
<p> Why does it bring me such peace?</p>
<p> Why?!</p>
<p> See?</p>
<p> Even though the painting is abstract, that yellow circle can represent the sun.</p>
<p> HOMER: Or Pac-Man at rest.</p>
<p> Dad, you think art sucks.</p>
<p> Snap out of it.</p>
<p> HOMER: Wow.</p>
<p> I mean, wow.</p>
<p> Every time I look at it from a different angle, - I see something new.</p>
<p> - [GROANS]</p>
<p> I just want to take a moment to acknowledge that for the first time, you're dragging me into the museum.</p>
<p> Yeah, it's a Topsy-turvy world.</p>
<p> Beach volleyball's bigger than regular volleyball.</p>
<p> Sorry, pally.</p>
<p> Sorry, gally.</p>
<p> But the museum's closed down for good.</p>
<p> - [GASPS]</p>
<p> - [GASPS]</p>
<p> Can we go in and look at our favorite painting one last time?</p>
<p> It's called The Poetess.</p>
<p> Oh, it's right there, inside the crate that's going to the auction house, where a billionaire will buy it and you'll never see it again.</p>
<p> Oh, and I'll have to take that, too.</p>
<p> [HOMER WHIMPERS]</p>
<p> Now museum, now you don't.</p>
<p> The Springfield Museum of Fine Art is the latest v*ctim of this city's budget woes.</p>
<p> The storied institution has closed its doors forever.</p>
<p> Its legendary art collection will be sold at auction and its docents released into the wild.</p>
<p> The closure is being protested by a coalition of local art lovers and homeless bathroom users.</p>
<p> [CHANTING]: Picasso, Goya, CÃ©zanne, DalÃ­, selling off artwork would be folly.</p>
<p> [ALL CHEER]</p>
<p> We're here, Vermeer, get used to it!</p>
<p> People, people.</p>
<p> Government is about making tough choices.</p>
<p> This was not one of them.</p>
<p> Museum attendance was near zero.</p>
<p> We lost thousands on stolen audio wands.</p>
<p> What do people want with wands?</p>
<p> These wands are putting the hurt on these walnuts.</p>
<p> MAN [OVER WAND]: Notice how Edward Hopper's use of windows invites the viewer into the scene but also keeps them at bay.</p>
<p> - [WAND CHIMES]</p>
<p> - [GRUNTS]</p>
<p> But Mayor Quimby, the Springfield Museum of Fine Art, or SMOFA, was a jewel.</p>
<p> SMOFA was the one institution of genuine culture our town could be proud of.</p>
<p> Stop saying SMOFA.</p>
<p> It never caught on.</p>
<p> Um, excuse me, Mayor SMOFA.</p>
<p> I'm not like these brainy tote bags over here.</p>
<p> I like my crusts stuffed, my martial arts mixed, and my movies fully Sandler-ed.</p>
<p> But there's this painting from that museum, and when I really look at it, only one word explains what I feel.</p>
<p> - What is it again?</p>
<p> - [WHISPERS]</p>
<p> - Transgender.</p>

<p> At Water's Edge by Paul CÃ©zanne, sold for $65 million.</p>
<p> Yeah!</p>
<p> I'm as happy as Steve Martin.</p>
<p> It's Oh, God, no.</p>
<p> Our last item is The Poetess by Joan MirÃ³.</p>
<p> The bidding starts at $5 million.</p>
<p> HOMER: I bid that.</p>
<p> - What are you doing?</p>
<p> - I have a plan to get the painting.</p>
<p> $6 million.</p>
<p> WOMAN: I think we can do better than that.</p>
<p> I need this painting for my private monkey sanctuary in Costa Rica.</p>
<p> The monkeys find the colors quite arousing.</p>
<p> $7 million.</p>
<p> - Eight million.</p>
<p> - Nine million.</p>
<p> Sir, we attempted to verify your funds at the First Bank of Moe's.</p>

<p> - [GROANS]</p>
<p> - It's okay, Dad.</p>
<p> You just really loved that painting.</p>
<p> The bidding stands at $8 million.</p>
<p> - Nine million.</p>
<p> - Ten million.</p>
<p> 11 million.</p>
<p> $15 million.</p>
<p> Joan MirÃ³'s The Poetess going once going twice sold!</p>
<p> To billionaire tech mogul Megan Matheson.</p>
<p> - Hmph.</p>
<p> - [SHUDDERS]</p>
<p> [GROANS]</p>
<p> [GROWLS]</p>
<p> Don't take that painting, I love it!</p>
<p> I won't let you take it!</p>
<p> Your story had everything a field trip, a dream sequence, Sideshow Mel and it gave your father the perfect motive </p>
<p> TO STEAL THAT PAINTING: a deeper connection to his daughter.</p>
<p> Well, maybe, but I'm sure he's innocent.</p>
<p> Mom, Lisa, 1970s horndog, Dad's run off.</p>
<p> He's on the lam!</p>
<p> You know, once I send your husband to prison, you'll be kind of single.</p>
<p> [CHUCKLES]</p>
<p> MANACEK: It seems Homer escaped out this window.</p>
<p> Hmm.</p>
<p> In all my years as an investigator, I've never seen a trellis take such a pounding.</p>
<p> I know it looks bad, but think about what we told you.</p>
<p> My husband could never have stolen that painting.</p>
<p> Hmm.</p>
<p> Thank you, Marge.</p>
<p> I now know exactly how everything happened.</p>
<p> How do you know that?</p>
<p> I'll be happy to explain over breakfast?</p>
<p> [GRUMBLES]</p>
<p> You have a real problem with women.</p>
<p> I know.</p>
<p> I'm seeing a therapist tonight at my place.</p>
<p> Oh, get out.</p>
<p> Go, go!</p>
<p> [SIGHS]</p>
<p> White chocolate the loneliest chocolate.</p>
<p> MANACEK: Homer, I know you're in there.</p>
<p> [GASPS]</p>
<p> How did you find me?</p>
<p> I knew you'd return to the scene of the crime: where your inner peace was stolen.</p>
<p> You can't bring me in.</p>
<p> You're not a cop.</p>
<p> You're not even a regular insurance investigator.</p>
<p> You're freelance.</p>
<p> You don't get paid unless you submit an invoice.</p>
<p> Which lets me control when my corporate year ends.</p>
<p> You're always one step ahead.</p>
<p> [LAUGHS]</p>
<p> I don't like you, Manacek.</p>
<p> Your family's story of how you fell in love with that painting did prove your innocence.</p>
<p> - How?</p>
<p> - By providing one crucial fact: you're too dumb to steal anything.</p>
<p> Maybe I did take it.</p>
<p> - Trust me, you didn't.</p>
<p> - I could have.</p>
<p> But I know you didn't.</p>
<p> That's what I'm saying.</p>
<p> - I'm smart.</p>
<p> - You're dumb.</p>
<p> After careful consideration of facts and evidence observed only by me, I can reveal who stole The Poetess: Ms.</p>
<p> Matheson.</p>
<p> [ALL GASP]</p>
<p> Your last IPO was DOA, and you needed the cash to keep your girlfriend in hybrid mosquito larva.</p>
<p> I've seen it a thousand times.</p>
<p> Impossible!</p>
<p> The armed guards never let the painting out of their sight.</p>
<p> But which armed guards?</p>
<p> It was a simple matter of finding the guards' identical twins, then hiring them to rob their own brothers.</p>
<p> That's the last impossible mystery you'll ever solve.</p>
<p> Well done, Mr.</p>
<p> Manacek.</p>
<p> Who would have suspected it was the person none of us had ever met before?</p>
<p> Yes, it's a shame she went through all that trouble to steal a painting that had already been stolen by you.</p>
<p> Uh, not yet, sir.</p>
<p> I mean, how dare you accuse me of such a crime?</p>
<p> But the painting was safely in our vault until it left the auction house.</p>
<p> But which auction house?</p>
<p> It was a simple matter of Burns building an identical auction house next door to the real one.</p>
<p> The actual painting never left the vault, so Burns could steal it at his leisure.</p>
<p> - Now?</p>
<p> - Yes, sir.</p>
<p> [GASPS]</p>
<p> My painting!</p>
<p> Oh, thank goodness those thieves didn't get you.</p>
<p> It's a shame I punched out a woman and an old man over a gift shop tote bag.</p>
<p> [ALL GASP]</p>
<p> Lisa?</p>
<p> [SIGHS]</p>
<p> It wasn't my plan to steal it.</p>
<p> That painting was the first thing my dad and I ever had in common.</p>
<p> I couldn't bear to see him lose it.</p>
<p> It was a simple matter of switching my canvas tote bag for the painting before it was even auctioned off.</p>
<p> I knew it was wrong, but isn't it a worse crime to let some billionaire hide art away where guys like my dad can never fall in love with it?</p>
<p> So, who gets The Poetess now?</p>
<p> $10 million.</p>
<p> Ownership of the painting reverts back to the city.</p>
<p> But where will we hang it?</p>
<p> We're knocking down the art museum.</p>
<p> And what are you doing with the money Springfield got from selling all the public's art?</p>
<p> Well, uh, we're, uh, building certain vitally needed civic improvements.</p>
<p> Everything I love in one place.</p>
<p> Beer.</p>
<p> Hot dog.</p>
<p> Bathroom.</p>
<p> Painting.</p>
<p> Daughter.</p>
<p> Marge, you're a beautiful woman, but you're loyal to your husband.</p>
<p> And I respect that.</p>
<p> But if things were different, would I have a sh*t?</p>
<p> You are the most conceited, chauvinistic, son of a [CHUCKLES]</p>
<p> I like you, Manacek.</p>
