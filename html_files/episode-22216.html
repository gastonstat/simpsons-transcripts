<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>(EXCLAIMING)</p>
<p>(BRAKES SCREECHING)</p>
<p>(YOWLING)</p>
<p>(Edna) Good news, children.</p>
<p>This Friday, we'll be holding a school-wide medieval festival.</p>
<p>Medieval? Like <em>Lord of the Rings?</em></p>
<p>No. Not at all.</p>
<p>(ALL GROAN)</p>
<p>Can't we just keep going forward in our textbooks?</p>
<p>No! Now I've already assigned each of you a role in the medieval court.</p>
<p>Martin, you shall be our king.</p>
<p>I shall pattern my reign on Enguerrand the Seventh, Sire de Coucy!</p>
<p>Tralloo trallay!</p>
<p>(Edna) Not so fast, Nelson.</p>
<p>You're one of King Martin's guards.</p>
<p>Ha ha!</p>
<p>You'll pay for this! My Liege.</p>
<p>What am I gonna be? Black Knight? Court Ninja? Bart the lmpaler!</p>
<p>Bart, you'll be playing the village cooper.</p>
<p>What kind of a knight is that?</p>
<p>The kind of knight that makes barrels and isn't a knight. Ha!</p>
<p><em>Ay, caramba!</em> Well, this stinks.</p>
<p>But I bet Lisa got something even stupider.</p>
<p>(FANFARE PLAYS) Hmm?</p>
<p>All hail the Queen!</p>
<p>Now, as queen, you shall be entitled to eat the same French fries the teachers do.</p>
<p>The ones made from potatoes?</p>
<p>The very same.</p>
<p>(INDISTINCT TALKING)</p>
<p>My coat of arms is a Spiderman <em>couchant</em> on a field vert.</p>
<p>What's <em>&quot;couchant&quot;</em> mean?</p>
<p>Lying down.</p>
<p>(GROANS) You mean like you?</p>
<p>Now what does <em>&quot;vert&quot;</em> mean?</p>
<p>Say it means punching.</p>
<p>Oh, Willie, during the festival, you'll be wearing these urine-soaked rags.</p>
<p>You're the village idiot.</p>
<p>Now, allow me to apply this rubber cement to your face to represent the ravages of plague.</p>
<p>Ach! My face!</p>
<p>What drunken call girl will have me now? Oh!</p>
<p>(RENAISSANCE MUSIC PLAYING)</p>
<p>Now, peasants, since the Middle Ages had no compact disks or Super Mario men, people found entertainment in abusing the village idiot.</p>
<p>So let history come alive.</p>
<p>(All) Yeah!</p>
<p>Wait! Let me take out my contact lenses!</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>Pelt all you want. But revenge will be Willie's!</p>
<p>(SCREAMS) That was a stapler!</p>
<p>(SINGING) <em>Dragon in the dungeon.</p>
<p>Maiden in my lair.</p>
<p>There's potions in my Wizard's pot.</p>
<p>Now drink it if you dare</em></p>
<p>Lute solo!</p>
<p>Yeah! (GRUNTS)</p>
<p>(ALL GASPING)</p>
<p>(LAUGHS)</p>
<p>Cooper! More pink lemon-ale!</p>
<p>(ALE SLOSHING)</p>
<p>(GRUNTING)</p>
<p>Cooper, thy staves are not flush.</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>(ALL LAUGHING)</p>
<p>You'll pay for this, my queen.</p>
<p>Guards, take him to the tower!</p>
<p>(SHUDDERS)</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>Where is the tower?</p>
<p>It's the backseat of my Merkur.</p>
<p>There's 37 cents in the coin caddy and stay out of my diary!</p>
<p>(RATS SQUEAKING)</p>
<p>Quiet, my pretties.</p>
<p>Soon, we'll have revenge on those who mocked me!</p>
<p>Also on those who were kind to me.</p>
<p>And on the parents who took time from their busy schedules to make today such a success.</p>
<p>Oh, I hate them all!</p>
<p>Noble idiot, bring in the pie!</p>
<p>(TRUMPETS PLAYING)</p>
<p>I dedicate this pie to the backbone of the feudal system.</p>
<p>The serfs!</p>
<p>(ALL SCREAMING)</p>
<p>(CACKLING)</p>
<p>Scary McBeasties, nibble and gnaw at their overstuffed buttocks!</p>
<p>Milhouse, don't open your mouth!</p>
<p>Whoa! (GAGGING)</p>
<p>(ALL SCREAMING)</p>
<p>(CLATTERING)</p>
<p>This is no accident.</p>
<p>(LAUGHING) Nice party, dink.</p>
<p>You're responsible for this, Simpson.</p>
<p>No way! I didn't do it!</p>
<p>Unlike all the other stuff I told you I didn't do which I did.</p>
<p>Bart, I'm sick of playing the tomfool!</p>
<p>You are hereby expelled from Springfield Elementary!</p>
<p>Boy, I can't believe you got expelled!</p>
<p>Well, don't expect to spend all week lying around on the couch like a bum!</p>
<p>'Cause that's my thing!</p>
<p>Bart, a school-sponsored medieval festival is supposed to be the best day of a young girl's life.</p>
<p>And you ruined it! You deserved to be expelled!</p>
<p>I didn't do it!</p>
<p>Mom, you believe me, don't you?</p>
<p>Bart, I love you.</p>
<p>But sometimes ldon%love your choices.</p>
<p>(SIGHS) Now we have to find another school for you.</p>
<p>And if you get kicked out of that one, you're going straight in the army where you'll be sent straight to America's latest military quagmire.</p>
<p>Where will it be? North Korea, Iran?</p>
<p>Anything's possible with Commander Cuckoo Bananas in charge!</p>
<p>Bart, this could be a good new school.</p>
<p>Oakwood Academy! Huh?</p>
<p>Mom, that's a school for the blind.</p>
<p>Think of the leg up you'd have.</p>
<p>How can we afford any of these private schools?</p>
<p>They're all so expensive.</p>
<p>If we want to throw good money after bad, why don't we just get Grampa that new pacemaker?</p>
<p>I need two double-A batteries, now!</p>
<p>Get 'em from the smoke detector.</p>
<p>What if there's a fire?</p>
<p>The smoke will wake us up.</p>
<p>How about this one? St. Jerome's Catholic School.</p>
<p>Catholic schools are usually the most affordable private schools.</p>
<p>Catholic school, eh? That'll straighten you out, boy.</p>
<p>There you don't just get bad grades, you go to hell!</p>
<p>Oh! Oh, no!</p>
<p>(SCREAMING)</p>
<p>My pacemaker!</p>
<p>(BEEPING)</p>
<p>Classic Grampa!</p>
<p>Class, we have a new student.</p>
<p>Bart, would you like to introduce yourself?</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Bart Simpson. <em>Ay, caramba.</em> Do the Bartman, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>(VIDEOGAME BEEPING)</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>In the old days, we'd use a ruler to deal with incorrigibles like you.</p>
<p>Thanks for the history lesson, Sis.</p>
<p>These days, we use a yardstick!</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>(SCREAMS)</p>
<p>I'll show you. I'll move 33 inches away.</p>
<p>A yard's 36!</p>
<p>(SCREAMS)</p>
<p>(GROANING)</p>
<p>Now you tell me.</p>
<p>I don't know what they taught you in public school.</p>
<p>But at St. Jerome's, we don't tolerate back sass.</p>
<p>Stretch out your arms like our Lord on the cross.</p>
<p>Now hold these dictionaries.</p>
<p>Now think what it would be like if you had nails in your hands.</p>
<p>Well, I guess they'd help me hold the dictionaries up.</p>
<p>Wrong answer!</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>(SCREAMS)</p>
<p>Stupid Catholic school.</p>
<p>Suffering from my hip attitude. I'm the real Jesus here.</p>
<p>(MAN LAUGHING)</p>
<p>So, it's sacrilege you're spoutin' now.</p>
<p>What's it to you, Irish?</p>
<p>My name's Father Sean.</p>
<p>And I used to be an ornery wee cuss myself.</p>
<p>Until one day after a drunken brawl with me dad...</p>
<p>(BOTH GRUNTING)</p>
<p>You're just like your mother! Can't take a punch!</p>
<p>(GROANING)</p>
<p>(Father Sean) <em>I was laying in the gutter picking up my teeth when Saint Peter himself appears before me.</em></p>
<p>Sean, you w*nk*r... <em>He says.</em></p>
<p>Repent of your wicked ways or sod off.</p>
<p><em>Then he gobbed in my face and turned back into a streetlight.</em></p>
<p>And that's how I came to the Church.</p>
<p>Well, I'm only here because I got blamed for a prank I didn't do!</p>
<p>Mmm-hmm.</p>
<p>Call me crazy, but I believe you.</p>
<p>You do? Of course I do.</p>
<p>You know, lots of church types started off as rotten wee buggers.</p>
<p>St. Augustine himself got his start stealing pears.</p>
<p>Stealing pairs of what?</p>
<p>Hubcaps, Reeboks, human eyes?</p>
<p>It's all in here. See for yourself.</p>
<p>Cool!</p>
<p>Sister Thomasina, I've taken the liberty of knocking the vinegar out of him.</p>
<p>He's all yours. Yeah, whatever.</p>
<p>Now, class, open your math books to the word problems of our Lord.</p>
<p>&quot;Billy and Joseph start their penance at the same time.</p>
<p>&quot;If each swear word brings 1,000 years in hell...&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Bart</strong>: <em>&quot;Saint Sebastian was a pious Roman soldier.</p>
<p>&quot;For preaching Christianity to the Romans, &quot;the Emperor Diocletian sentenced him to death by hail of arrows.&quot;</em></p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>Now it's payback time!</p>
<p>(GRUNTING)</p>
<p>I wish I'd gone to more orgies.</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>Wow! This stuff is great!</p>
<p>It's way better than the comics I get at the dentist!</p>
<p>Then Father Sean quoted Eminem in his sermon.</p>
<p>And in art class, we painted Saint Joan burning at the stake.</p>
<p>And mine was the grossest.</p>
<p>(CACKLING) Catholics rock!</p>
<p>(MUTTERS)</p>
<p>Bart, I'm glad you had fun.</p>
<p>But I wouldn't get too into that Catholic church with all the sitting and standing and kneeling.</p>
<p>It's like Simon Says without a winner.</p>
<p>Mom, that's blasphemy.</p>
<p>I'll say a rosary for you.</p>
<p>Don't you touch bead one! (GRUNTS)</p>
<p>Homer, maybe we should be concerned.</p>
<p>Catholics can be a peculiar bunch.</p>
<p>No birth control, no meat on Friday.</p>
<p>No meat? What do they eat? Light bulbs?</p>
<p>Let's just change the subject.</p>
<p>Bart, would you like to say grace?</p>
<p>Yes'm.</p>
<p><em>In nomine Patris et fillii et Spiritus Sancti.</em></p>
<p>Bart, what the hell are you saying?</p>
<p>That's Latin, Dad. The language of Plutarch.</p>
<p>Mickey Mouse's dog?</p>
<p>No. Plutarch!</p>
<p>He chronicled the lives of the Roman emperors.</p>
<p>Oh! I didn't need that new fact!</p>
<p>Now I forgot who won Bud Bowl VIII.</p>
<p>Boy, I'm pulling you out of that crazy school!</p>

<p>(GRUNTING) Hey!</p>
<p>I'm Bart Simpson's father.</p>
<p>And I'm sick of you teaching my son your time-tested values.</p>
<p>(SNIFFS)</p>
<p>Hey, what's that smell?</p>
<p>We're having our monthly pancake dinner. Care to join us?</p>
<p>You've transformed breakfast into dinner.</p>
<p>It's a miracle!</p>
<p>Log Cabin, full of taste, my stomach is with thee.</p>
<p>Blessed art thou among syrups. And bless...</p>
<p>No praying to the condiments!</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p><em>Que buenos</em> cake-os de pan-o!</p>
<p>Oh, boy! Oh. yeah! Good!</p>
<p>Um...</p>
<p>All pancakes aside, I really came here to talk about my son.</p>
<p>I understand. But can it wait until after Bingo?</p>
<p>Bingo? That's my favorite game.</p>
<p>I just can't remember what to yell out when you win.</p>
<p>&quot;Bingo.&quot; That's my favorite game.</p>
<p>I just can't remember what to yell out when you win.</p>
<p>Oh! How about you just say, &quot;Yay, I won!&quot;</p>
<p>Bingo!</p>
<p>I've never seen such masterful Bingo playing.</p>
<p>What's your secret, Homer?</p>
<p>(WHISPERS) You have to cheat!</p>
<p>Uh, listen.</p>
<p>Is it true you priest guys can't ever...</p>
<p>(MUTTERS) You know...</p>
<p>I'll admit, the vow of celibacy is one of our sterner challenges.</p>
<p>Celibacy? I was talking about the meat on Friday thing!</p>
<p>Man, you guys got more crazy rules than Blockbuster Video!</p>
<p>Well, that's true. But if you do break a rule, you can always find absolution in the sacrament of confession.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait. No matter what I did, no matter how many people lost their pensions, it's forgiven like that?</p>
<p>If you truly repent, then yes.</p>
<p>Okay! Let's make some magic here.</p>
<p>I wiped a booger on your shirt. I made a dog and a cat kiss.</p>
<p>I swiped a bolted down TV from a Holiday lnn, I coveted the wife in <em>Jaws 2,</em> I lied to a waiter, I masturbated eight billion times, and I have no plans to stop masturbating in the future.</p>
<p>Whoo-hoo! I'm clean! In your face, Lord!</p>
<p>Um, not quite, Mr. Simpson.</p>
<p>I can only absolve you if you're a Catholic.</p>
<p>Right. And how do I join?</p>
<p>Do I whale on some Unitarians?</p>
<p>Well, it's a little harder than that.</p>
<p>It begins by looking inside yourself.</p>
<p>(MOANS) But it ends with bread and wine. Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p>Homer, you've been out all night.</p>
<p>And you look like you've accepted someone as your personal something.</p>
<p>Were you at that Catholic church?</p>
<p>Look, Marge. I know I was supposed to yell at that priest.</p>
<p>But he's so cool!</p>
<p>He plays drums in a band with a bunch of other priests!</p>
<p>I knew they'd try to convert you!</p>
<p>That's what they do!</p>
<p>Well, I'm not having another 12 kids!</p>
<p>Marge, no one is saying 12. Nine, 10, tops. See?</p>
<p>Forget it!</p>
<p>And you know, I went to a Catholic wedding once.</p>
<p>The incense ruined my pantsuit!</p>
<p>Marge, relax.</p>
<p>I never heard of anyone getting so upset about religion.</p>
<p>(INAUDIBLE)</p>
<p>(ORGAN PLAYING)</p>
<p>Marge is here all alone.</p>
<p>I heard her son is Catholic now. Her husband, too.</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>Marge, all by yourself today?</p>
<p>Well, Homer and Bart are...</p>
<p>Well, they're under the weather.</p>
<p>Mmm-hmm. Under the weather?</p>
<p>Or under the spell of a man in a pointy white hat?</p>
<p>All right. I admit it! They're both at the Catholic church!</p>
<p>Reverend, what should I do?</p>
<p>Marge, this calls for an emergency meeting of the church's spiritual council.</p>
<p>To Stuckey's!</p>
<p>Bart and Homer can't go Catholic.</p>
<p>Romans have been separate from us since the Schism of Lourdes in 1573.</p>
<p>And that was about our holy right to come to church with wet hair!</p>
<p>Which we've since abolished.</p>
<p>I guess it's good that they're taking an interest in spirituality.</p>
<p>Oh, spirituality's great, Marge. Hey, I'm Mr. Spiritual.</p>
<p>But remember, a different faith means a different afterlife.</p>
<p>Hmm...</p>
<p>Marge Simpson, welcome to Protestant Heaven.</p>
<p>Through in one? Hurrah.</p>
<p>Poppy, have you seen Dash?</p>
<p>Where's Homer and Bart?</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>(MARIACHI MUSIC PLAYING)</p>
<p>(BOTH GRUNTING)</p>
<p>(GROANS) Wow! Up here, that feels good!</p>
<p>Now dance, you heavenly gobs!</p>
<p>(IRISH MUSIC PLAYING)</p>
<p>Oh, I wish my family was with me.</p>
<p>Sorry, Marge. They're just not our sort.</p>
<p>Well, then I'd like to speak with Jesus.</p>
<p>I'm afraid he's gone native.</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Whoa! Stop it!</p>
<p>Guys, I'm serious!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Don't worry, Marge. We'll get your boy back.</p>
<p>Excuse me. That better be decaf.</p>
<p>The rim is orange, ain't it?</p>
<p>Or does under-tipping make you color blind?</p>
<p>Her husband's sleeping with her sister.</p>
<p>Who said that?</p>
<p>So now what do we call it when the communion wafer becomes the body of Christ?</p>
<p>(GRUNTING)</p>
<p>(Kevin) Hey! Yes, Homer?</p>
<p>Transubstantiation.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>He cheated. He's got it written on his arm.</p>
<p>(HOMER LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Welcome to the jungle, Kevin!</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>First communion?</p>
<p>Oh, we've gotta stop 'em now!</p>
<p>Once they seal the deal, there's no turning back!</p>
<p>Just like the Jews with their snippety-snip.</p>
<p>Bart, get your things! You're leaving with me!</p>
<p>Sorry, Mom. But this is a Catholic church.</p>
<p>Chicks don't have any authority here.</p>
<p>Mrs. Simpson, please. If there's a problem, I'm sure we can talk it over.</p>
<p>Back off, Pope-y LaPew!</p>
<p>Marge, what are you doing here?</p>
<p>Homer, you're physically an adult.</p>
<p>And what you do in the privacy of your own soul is your business.</p>
<p>But I didn't change Bart's diapers for five years to see him become a Catholic!</p>
<p>I thought there was a monster in the potty.</p>
<p>Let's go! (GRUNTS)</p>
<p>I think we've lost them.</p>
<p>They weren't following us.</p>
<p>Then why did I drive through that barn?</p>
<p>Oh! Why did you guys have to take me away?</p>
<p>You're always nagging me to go to church.</p>
<p>And now that I am, it's the wrong one.</p>
<p>I just don't think your father's the right person to pick out a religion for you.</p>
<p>Okay. I'll pick a religion for me. Judaism.</p>
<p><em>(SINGING) Don't have a cow, man.</p>
<p>Don't have a cow, man Don't have a cow, man.</p>
<p>Have a piece of fish Oy!</em></p>
<p>Bart, we're here to bring you back to the one true faith, the Western Branch of American Reform Presbylutheranism.</p>
<p><em>(HAWAII FIVE-O RINGTONE)</em></p>
<p>Hello, Homer.</p>
<p>Marge, you bring Bart home now!</p>
<p>Once you go Vatican, you can't go back again!</p>
<p>It wasn't a fair fight!</p>
<p>Your church suckered him in with gory stories!</p>
<p>Just like we were suckered into getting Cinemax!</p>
<p>Face it, Marge. Catholics rule.</p>
<p>We got Boston, South America, the good part of lreland, and we're making serious inroads in Mozambique, baby!</p>
<p>Well, I'm gonna show Bart that Protestants can be hip, too.</p>
<p>How do you like those croutons?</p>
<p>Oh! Why does that woman thwart my sporadic interest in my children?</p>
<p>Shouldn't Bart and I be able to choose our own religion if we want to?</p>
<p>Strange as it sounds, Dad, I agree with you.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Everyone should be able to choose their faith.</p>
<p>Just like I chose Buddhism.</p>
<p>Buddhism?</p>
<p>VVell, I guess lots of kids have imaginary friends.</p>
<p>I'll ignore that.</p>
<p>In fact, I'm gonna help you.</p>
<p>I have a pretty good idea where they are.</p>
<p>We can't lose Bart now that we're so close.</p>
<p>If I do, I'll be the worst priest ever.</p>
<p>Well, except for, you know...</p>
<p>Ahem!</p>
<p>Now, Bart, isn't this the kind of religion you'd like to be a part of for all eternity?</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, hot off their conversion to Christianity, the band once known as Quiet Riot, Pious Riot!</p>
<p>(AUDIENCE CHEERING)</p>
<p><em>(SINGING) Come on, feel the Lord.</p>
<p>Heaven's your reward.</p>
<p>We'll get saved, saved, saved</em></p>
<p>What's wrong, Bart? You love youth culture.</p>
<p>Mom, a religion isn't cool just because they've glommed onto some crappy rock band from the 1940s.</p>
<p>Hey, we've played more state fairs than The b*at!</p>
<p>Yeah, that's right. That's right.</p>
<p>You just don't get it.</p>
<p>I've made a sacred commitment to the Catholic Church and... (GASPS)</p>
<p>Paintball! Awesome!</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>(SCREAMS)</p>
<p>Die! Die! Die!</p>
<p>Oh, Bart, I knew one of these dumb things would work.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>(GASPS) My hive! My trademark hive!</p>
<p>Hop in, boy. We'll show your mother our God kicks her God's butt.</p>
<p>Back off, you servants of the Holy See!</p>
<p>(g*n COCKING)</p>
<p>Easy on the zeal, church-os.</p>
<p>I've got something to say.</p>
<p>Don't you get it?</p>
<p>It's all Christianity, people.</p>
<p>The little stupid differences are nothing next to the big stupid similarities!</p>
<p>He's right! Can't we all get together and concentrate on our real enemies?</p>
<p>Monogamous gays and stem cells?</p>
<p>Well said, mate. Put 'er there.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES) My pleasure.</p>
<p><em>Note to self, have hand re-blessed.</em></p>
<p>Bart, you've taught us all an important lesson.</p>
<p>We Christians have been niggling over details for far too long.</p>
<p>Amen. And I hope that from this day forward, we all learn to take Bart's message of tolerance and understanding to heart.</p>
<p>We believe that God's last prophet, Bart Simpson, preached a message of tolerance and love.</p>
<p>We believe the holy Bartman preached a message of understanding and peace before he was betrayed by his follower, Milhouse, and pulled apart by snowmobiles until he died.</p>
<p>(All) Eat my shorts!</p>
<p>(All) Cowabunga!</p>
