<p>(PANTING) Hi. Sorry we're late.  </p>
<p>This is Maggie.<br />
We're here for our first day.  </p>
<p>Hello, Maggie.<br />
And who will be picking her up?  </p>
<p>W... A-After she falls down?  </p>
<p>No, at the end of the day.  </p>
<p>Wait, I don't stay with her?   </p>
<p>Research shows pre-toddlers learn best in a parent-free environment.   </p>
<p>Unless you<em> want</em> to stunt her growth, which is great.   </p>
<p>(QUIETLY): We're not supposed to judge.   </p>
<p>No, no, it's not that.   </p>
<p>I just don't want Maggie to feel abandoned.   </p>
<p>(GIGGLING)   </p>
<p>So, we'll see you at  :  .   </p>
<p>Oh. Okay, then.   </p>
<p>Hmm. Now what will I do with the rest of my day?   </p>
<p>I know. I'll ask my favorite mommy blog.   </p>
<p>- Hmm. Hmm.<br />

I want to see you bitches suffer!   </p>
<p>(CHEERING)   </p>
<p>(QUIETLY):<br />
Am I the only one who heard that?   </p>
<p>I love it. It's like being coached by the voice inside my head.   </p>
<p>Spin yourselves to death, you land manatees!   </p>

<p>Oh, my God, I can't believe this is happening.   </p>
<p>I'm so sex-prised!   </p>

<p>It's pronounced &quot;Well and Good.&quot;   </p>
<p>Ugh, why is everyone talking to me?   </p>
<p>Well, if all these people want to work here, maybe<em> I</em> want to work here.   </p>
<p>All right, go to tablet seven to take your pre-application ethics assessment.   </p>

<p>You're the only one we partnered with.   </p>
<p>Hmm.   </p>
<p>Okay, so I work here now.   </p>
<p>I never asked what we sell.   </p>
<p>I can figure this out.   </p>
<p>Hmm. Candy? Bath b*mb? Blowtorches?   </p>
<p>$   bottles of soda?   </p>
<p>Uh, excuse me.   </p>
<p>Uh, do you recommend<br />
the tincture or the oil?   </p>
<p>I... The-the tincture is more expensive, I guess.   </p>
<p>Look, this is about<em> you.</em>   </p>
<p>And taking care of you. I think.   </p>
<p>So you have to put yourself... first?   </p>
<p>Well, your no-frills, fumbling sales pitch has won me over. I'll take both. Yes...   </p>
<p>Wow, girl, you just made a hundred-dollar sale.   </p>
<p>You're gonna fit in great here.   </p>
<p>Thing is, what does<em> here</em> sell?   </p>
<p>Is this what RadioShack is now?   </p>
<p>Mm, no.<br />
We're a high-end cannabis boutique.   </p>
<p>You sell pot?!   </p>
<p>Technically, I check I.D.s.   </p>
<p><em>You</em> sell pot.   </p>
<p>(GASPS)   </p>
<p>I'm a drugs dealer!   </p>
<p>Mm, cannabis is legal in this state now.   </p>
<p>Well, so is water-skiing,   </p>
<p>but that doesn't mean I have to sell it!   </p>
<p>I'm sorry.   </p>
<p>Marge, don't leave, seriously.    </p>
<p>Like, I'm asking.    </p>
<p>Drederick Tatum!<br />
(GASPS) I own your countertop grill.    </p>
<p>Oh, take care not to use metal utensils on the non-stick surfaces.    </p>
<p>But anyway, after my boxing career ended,    </p>
<p>I was in a lot of pain.    </p>
<p>Specifically, in my punching hands and my blocking face.    </p>
<p>But following a regimen of CBD oil and medicinal hits from a Pikachu bong, I was able to enjoy life again.    </p>
<p>Which inspired me to create Well and Good Healing Emporiums.    </p>
<p>But pot is for Cheeches... and Chongs.    </p>
<p>Marge, it's not about getting high.    </p>
<p>It's about wellness.    </p>
<p>And that's why I've hand-picked the perfect team here.    </p>
<p>I'm an expert in cannabinoids and cutting-edge delivery systems, aka infusers, decarboxylators, transdermals and pet suppositories.    </p>
<p>And I'm super hot.    </p>
<p>And what do you need<em> me</em> for?    </p>
<p>Marge, people know you want to help them, that it's safe here.    </p>
<p>Not some place for Cheeches and Chongs, as you so recently put it.    </p>
<p>Uh, I'm sorry.<br />
I don't think this is really me.    </p>
<p>- Good luck with your lifestyle.<br />
- Uh...    </p>
<p>Oh, it's a shame there's no drug for hurt feelings.    </p>
<p>Oh, wait, there totally is.    </p>
<p>(ALL MUNCHING)    </p>
<p>You know, in some families, they go around the table and everyone says one thing they learned that day.    </p>
<p>Okay. I learned<em> that.</em>    </p>
<p>Well,<em> I</em> learned that the former heavyweight champion of the world owns a marijuana store.    </p>
<p>And he offered me a job, which I turned down.    </p>
<p>Wait, what?    </p>
<p>I mean, the people were really cool, and they thought<em> I</em> was cool, which made me feel &quot;stoked.&quot;    </p>
<p>(SIGHS) But I'm not going to be a reefer saleslady.    </p>
<p>Well, I guess there's nothing wrong with it.    </p>
<p>Cannabis is legal in this state.    </p>
<p>Yeah, it's basically the same thing as working in a liquor store.    </p>
<p>You can work in a liquor store?    </p>
<p>- (GASPS) Mmm...<br />
- Stay with us, big guy.    </p>
<p>Mm...    </p>
<p>Wow. I thought you'd be opposed to it.    </p>
<p>People are stressed out these days.    </p>
<p>Scurvy is back, there's, like,    wars going on.    </p>
<p>Whales are eating our precious ocean plastic.    </p>
<p>Maybe people want to smoke a doob for that.    </p>
<p>Oh, yeah, everyone's selling crap to stoners now.    </p>
<p>Have you seen the new Krusty Burger commercial?    </p>
<p><em>(SITAR MUSIC PLAYING)</em>    </p>
<p><em>When you've got the munchies, for some reason...</em>    </p>

<p><em>served on a warm doughnut.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Or a spaghetti-filled grilled cheese sandwich</em>    </p>
<p><em>drizzled with ranch pudding.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Krusty's Munchie Mouthfuls. It's high time you tried it.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Get it? Get it?! Get it?</em>    </p>
<p>(CHUCKLES) I get it.    </p>
<p>Well, Mr. Tatum did personally choose me.    </p>
<p>He said I was helpful.    </p>
<p>Honey, you're the most helpful person I've ever met.    </p>
<p>Now go sell the safe legal drugs our kids should never, ever use!    </p>
<p>- Especially Bart!<br />
- Uh...?    </p>
<p>(HUMMING)    </p>
<p>Is this an Apple store?    </p>
<p>Everyone keeps asking that.    </p>
<p>I dropped my phone because of my arthritis.    </p>
<p>We can't fix your phone, but I can sure help with that arthritis.    </p>

<p>(MOANS) Oh, he knows how much self-esteem I get from selling bud.    </p>
<p>And that's our good frisbee.    </p>
<p>I'm afraid that you cannot continue with this company while your husband is taking pot back to the dark ages of     .    </p>
<p>- I-I'm very sorry.<br />
- Oh, no. No, no, no.    </p>
<p>Please, please don't fire me.    </p>
<p>I want to be your face.    </p>
<p>When Homer realizes how much this is hurting me, I'm sure he'll understand.    </p>
<p>I don't understand.    </p>
<p>We're doing the same thing, except you dress like a doctor, and I dress like a cool toddler.    </p>
<p>Don't you get it?    </p>
<p>I'm a healer, and you're a dealer.    </p>
<p>You need to quit.    </p>
<p>I can quit whenever I want.<br />
I just don't want to.    </p>
<p>What happened to the quitter I married?    </p>
<p>I quit quitting!    </p>

<p>- It's not different!<br />
- And you spent $ ,   ...    </p>
<p>I make CNN much funnier!    </p>
<p>- (HUMMING)<br />
- Homer wouldn't quit.    </p>
<p>Here's my smock, my key to the hash register, my business card reading &quot;associate.&quot;    </p>
<p>Instead of being the face of the company, my face will just be me.    </p>
<p>Wait, Marge.<br />
There is one way to save your job, but it would entail the betrayal of your husband, which I would never ask you to do.    </p>
<p>Well, I mean, it doesn't hurt to ask.    </p>
<p>With your help, we can get the government to shut him down.    </p>
<p>The FBI? The DEA?    </p>
<p>The County Health Department.    </p>
<p>I don't understand.<br />
What crime is Homer committing?    </p>
<p>Pot's legal.    </p>
<p>Yes, but he isn't licensed to serve non-psychotropic edibles, aka food.    </p>
<p>If he offers snacks to his customers and they eat even one bite, we go in and take him down.    </p>
<p>So we need you to bait the trap with these.    </p>
<p>Are you in?    </p>
<p>(GROANS SOFTLY)    </p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.    </p>
<p>- HOMER: Nailed it.<br />
- Mm-hmm.    </p>
<p>You're the son I never had.    </p>
<p>Hey, Homer.<br />
Look who's stopped by over here.    </p>
<p>I am so sorry about our little tiff.    </p>
<p>Will you accept this apology gift for you and your friends?    </p>
<p>Oh, honey. You're always in my corner.    </p>
<p>I have the most loving, supportive, loyal wife in the world.    </p>
<p>(GRUNTS)    </p>
<p>- (GROANS)<br />
- (HIGH-PITCHED RINGING)    </p>
<p>(SHOUTS, MUTTERS)    </p>
<p>(HUMMING)    </p>
<p>If Simpson keeps eating like this, he'll hit bottom dust before anyone takes the bait.    </p>
<p>Come on, you fat bastard, offer the customer some cheese balls.    </p>
<p>And the whole floor is an air hockey table, so moving furniture... is like...    </p>
<p>- (SHOUTS)<br />
- Homer!    </p>
<p>Give your friends some cheese balls.    </p>
<p>- Would anyone care to partake?<br />

<p>Code Orange. Go, go, go!    </p>
<p>- Stop eating!<br />

<p>- (POUNDING ON DOOR)<br />
- AGENT: Health Department. This is a raid.    </p>
<p>We got to get rid of the stuff.    </p>
<p>Oh, no! Come on!    </p>
<p>Oh, God!    </p>
<p>We got everything we need.    </p>
<p>You're shut down, pal.    </p>
<p>- (MOE SHUDDERING)<br />
- You, you knew.    </p>
<p>- You...<br />
- Set you up.    </p>
<p>You're coming with us, scumbag, to pay a $   fine.    </p>
<p>(MOANS SOFTLY)    </p>
<p>(SNIFFS) Ah...    </p>
<p>Marge, darling, everything is so perfect.    </p>
<p>I hope your husband wasn't too upset about the... you know, the treachery.    </p>
<p>Oh, well, Homer is very... easygoing, so...    </p>
<p>(SLURRING): Excuse me, can any of these oils or goos help me with a kn*fe wound?    </p>
<p>I have been stabbed, in the back!    </p>
<p>How did you get in?<br />
This is by invitation only.    </p>
<p>I said I was Kevin Smith's father.    </p>
<p>No one questioned me.    </p>
<p>Homer, control yourself.    </p>
<p>You're upsetting the influencers.    </p>
<p>They're very easily influenced.    </p>
<p>(SIGHS) That guy is on alcohol.    </p>
<p>Please don't ruin this.    </p>
<p>This is cannabinoid health, and I am its face.    </p>
<p>(BLOWS RASPBERRY) Cabana boy health.    </p>
<p>If it's so good for you... why have you never tried pot, ever?    </p>
<p>(GASPING, COUGHING)    </p>
<p>Well... does a doctor need to try insulin to know that it helps diabetes?    </p>
<p>Yes. I think<em> she</em> should.    </p>
<p>Surprise! The doctor's a woman. Sexist!    </p>
<p>- Oh, yeah. - Good point.<br />
- That is sexist.    </p>
<p>Look, I don't have a problem with pot.    </p>
<p>I can start any time I want.    </p>
<p>I'll do some right now.    </p>
<p>Perfect. &quot;Serenity.&quot;    </p>
<p>(GRUMBLES)    </p>
<p>See? Nothing.    </p>
<p>I'm probably one of those people it doesn't work on.    </p>
<p>I feel like I'm on an elevator that's going up and down at the same time.    </p>
<p>Something's wrong. You said this was about wellness, but I feel high.    </p>
<p>Okay, okay, listen.    </p>
<p>What you need to understand is this: I'm high, too!    </p>
<p>(LAUGHS)    </p>
<p>I'm Serenityed out of my gourd.    </p>
<p>(LAUGHS)    </p>
<p>- Yeah, baby. (LAUGHS)<br />

<p>I've got to come down.<br />
I've got to eat something.    </p>
<p>Um, that was a chicken pot<em> pot</em> pie.    </p>
<p>Oh, no. I ate an eatable.    </p>
<p>And you just wiped your mouth with a Hash-nap, the most potent thing here.    </p>
<p>(GRUNTS, GASPS)    </p>
<p>MARGE: Is this how I always walk?    </p>
<p>What do I do with my arms? Okay, got it.    </p>
<p>This is normal.    </p>

- HOMER: Honey, it's me.    </p>
<p>Homie.    </p>
<p>You're gonna be okay.    </p>
<p>In two hours that will seem like   .    </p>
<p>You're so sweet.    </p>
<p>And I ratted you out.    </p>
<p>No, I get it.    </p>
<p>You found a place that made you feel special, and you didn't want to lose that.    </p>
<p>I still feel weird.    </p>
<p>Maybe you'd feel less weird if I were weird, too.    </p>
<p>Here, I'll smoke one of your futuristic joints.    </p>
<p>That's not a doobie!    </p>
<p>- Hmm?<br />
- Aah!    </p>
<p>(GRUNTING)    </p>

<p>(PEOPLE SCREAM)    </p>
<p>Oh, man, Dad, what did you do?    </p>
<p>(SCREAMING)    </p>
<p>Hemp clothes burns like paper!    </p>
<p>All wrong, all wrong, all wrong!    </p>
<p>(PSYCHEDELIC MUSIC PLAYING)    </p>
<p>- MARGE: Oops.<br />
- Be cool.    </p>
<p>- Mm.<br />
- Cheer up, neck face.    </p>
<p>If there's one thing I know, it's life is nothing but pain.    </p>
<p>People will always need guys like you and me to get them wasted.    </p>
<p>Yeah, thanks, monster man hallucination.    </p>
<p>Your words are a-a great comfort to me.    </p>
<p>We'll get through it somehow.    </p>
