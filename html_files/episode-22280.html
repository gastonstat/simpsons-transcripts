<p>Season Finale --- All About Lisa.</p>
<p>Welcome to the 38th annual Springfield Showbiz Awards.</p>
<p>There are more stars here tonight than you can see in the sky, thanks to light pollution.</p>
<p>Here comes the magnificently-mammaried, mistress of midnight movie mayhem, Booberella.</p>
<p>The twins look happy tonight.</p>
<p>And what have we here?</p>
<p>It's ventriloquist Arthur Crandall and his walnut wingman, Gabbo.</p>
<p>Gabbo!</p>
<p>Gabbo, over here!</p>
<p>Get a job, parasites.</p>
<p>We now come to our final award, &quot;Entertainer of the Year.&quot;</p>
<p>An award so prestigious, that it recently won the &quot;Award of the Year&quot; award at the 2007 Awardy Awards.</p>
<p>This year's nominees are an eclectic group.</p>
<p>This distinguished-looking gentleman is a highly-respected actor.</p>
<p>It's not important what he says, or who he's a parody of.</p>
<p>Only one person here really matters... the recipient of this award.</p>
<p>No, it is not me.</p>
<p>I am but your humble narrator in this tale of fame, betrayal and coin collecting.</p>
<p>But more about that later.</p>
<p>Nor is it him.</p>
<p>Nor him.</p>
<p>Nor ham.</p>
<p>No, tonight is about her.</p>
<p>This year's award goes to...</p>
<p>Lisa Simpson.</p>
<p>Surprised?</p>
<p>Let me start at the beginning, and tell you a little bit about Lisa.</p>
<p>In fact, All About Lisa.</p>
<p>And now, in honor of Krusty's 4,000th episode, put your hands together for Drew Carey.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Wow, 4,000 episodes.</p>
<p>It seems like just yesterday Krusty stole his first joke from me.</p>
<p>Seriously, though, I remember watching him as a kid, and I thought, &quot;I could do that, and I'm a kid.&quot;</p>
<p>What I love about Krusty is, he's always on... but to find out what, you've gotta test his pee.</p>
<p>Pee!</p>
<p>Seriously, test his pee.</p>
<p>He's a danger to the community.</p>
<p>And now I give you a man whose act will never grow old, because it started out that way: Krusty the Clown.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I never thought I'd make it past 400 episodes, what with the drinking and the smoking and the fact that I'm just not that good.</p>
<p>It seems like just yesterday that we started the show, with the original Krusketeers.</p>
<p>Who's our favorite TV clown who likes to clown around?</p>
<p>K-R-U...</p>
<p>S-T-Y...</p>
<p>Hey! Quit steppin' on my solo, ya creepy little show monkeys!</p>
<p>And here they are today.</p>
<p>Come on out, Krusketeers.</p>
<p>I'm Jesse.</p>
<p>C.J.</p>
<p>You owe me money, Krusty.</p>
<p>I did time for you, clown.</p>
<p>Hard time.</p>
<p>Isn't that great. They all came back to see me.</p>
<p>That's right. All except the successful ones.</p>
<p>Now guess what, kids?</p>
<p>The Krusty Show is searching for a new Krusketeer.</p>
<p>It could be any of you.</p>
<p>As long you're willing to sign a 20 year personal services contract where I get 99% of all your earnings.</p>
<p>I am so gonna try out for that.</p>
<p>Me, too. But I hope you get it.</p>
<p>No, I hope you get it.</p>
<p>Well, I really hope you get it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I hope I get it, too. Later.</p>
<p>For a second there, he hoped I got it.</p>
<p>A great man once observed: &quot;90% of success is showing up on time.&quot;</p>
<p>Sorry I'm four hours late.</p>
<p>Now let's pick a Krusketeer!</p>
<p>For my first impression...</p>
<p>I'm a lantern fish.</p>
<p>Now I'm a jack-o'-lantern.</p>
<p>E.T.</p>
<p>B.E.T.</p>
<p>Yay, Bart!</p>
<p>My son's a good-for-somethin'!</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, okay.</p>
<p>You kids were all terrific.</p>
<p>I wish I could make each of you a Krusketeer, but we only have enough money for one.</p>
<p>Plus, I don't really want to.</p>
<p>So after much consideration of all your talents, my new Krusketeer is...</p>
<p>What's your kid's name again?</p>
<p>Nelson Muntz.</p>
<p>Wilbur Mudd.</p>
<p>That's me.</p>
<p>Here's Mudd in your eye.</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>I can't believe I lost.</p>
<p>That's not fair Bart was great.</p>
<p>Hey, Krusty,... you're making a huge mistake not hiring my brother.</p>
<p>Why don't you hire them both?</p>
<p>It won't cost you anything you could call Bart an intern.</p>
<p>In fact, the intern thing could open up a whole new world of free labor for you.</p>
<p>Did you know the Discovery Channel doesn't have a single paid employee?</p>
<p>Hm. Okay, kid, you've convinced me.</p>
<p>To make Bart a Krusketeer?</p>
<p>Hell, no. To make you my new intern.</p>
<p>You're a real go-getter.</p>
<p>Now go get me my dry-cleaning, which is my code word for scotch.</p>
<p>And get me a scotch, which is my code word for my bookie.</p>
<p>Also, go get my dry-cleaning.</p>
<p>Wha... but...</p>
<p>Wha, but, wha, wha, wha, but.</p>
<p>What are you standing around for?</p>
<p>I wish I was paying you, so I could dock your salary.</p>
<p>Lisa didn't know it then, but she had just dipped her toe into the business of show.</p>
<p>And it is a business, as you shall find out in about three seconds.</p>
<p>Two... one...</p>
<p>Over the years, show business has been home to scoundrels and saints, thespians and harlequins, Abbots and Costelli.</p>
<p>And they all had one thing in common... an underpaid assistant.</p>
<p>Cancel my 1:00. Move my 2:00 to 1:00 and cancel that.</p>
<p>Oh, and go to my joke file and make all the&quot;Sophia Lorens&quot; into &quot;Lindsay Lohans.&quot;</p>
<p>So do a global change?</p>
<p>What am I, Al Gore? Just do it.</p>
<p>What are you lookin' at?</p>
<p>I'm just trying to hit my marks.</p>
<p>And I don't? Is that what you're saying?</p>
<p>No, no. I think you're a consummate pro.</p>
<p>Oh, so now you're judging me.</p>
<p>Well, what do ya think of this: you're fired.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, my mom says you're a selfish lover.</p>
<p>I know what I want and I get it.</p>
<p>I'll trash you in my memoirs!</p>
<p>Pay attention you'll be writing my memoirs.</p>
<p>I'll never last here.</p>
<p>Chin up, little gofer.</p>
<p>You can succeed with Krusty.</p>
<p>A few hints: Always carry a cigar in case he asks.</p>
<p>Never meet his gaze.</p>
<p>And if he mentions Mitzi Gaynor, and he will, for God's sake act like you know who she is.</p>
<p>I got pastrami stuck in my teeth, and that's everybody's problem.</p>
<p>Who's got floss?</p>
<p>Here you go, Krusty.</p>
<p>Nicely done, kid.</p>
<p>You're the best thing that's happened to this business since...</p>
<p>Mitzi Gaynor?</p>
<p>I was gonna say &quot;cheap Korean animation,&quot; but sure.</p>
<p>I can't believe you're working for Krusty and I'm not.</p>
<p>I know everything about that clown.</p>
<p>Favorite blintz: blueberry.</p>
<p>Favorite horse in the 2004</p>
<p><strong>Belmont</strong>: Smarty Jones.</p>
<p>Krusty lost a bundle and had to endorse baby wipes in Norway.</p>
<p>Which I have a case of.</p>
<p>Krusty klovnen baby visker!</p>
<p>Stupid Krusty...I hate this...</p>
<p>Bart's having girl trouble. You better go talk to him.</p>
<p>It's clown trouble.</p>
<p>That's your responsibility.</p>
<p>I thought I was in charge of bedtime stories and pets dying.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, we're adding clowns.</p>
<p>Oh! Fine.</p>
<p>But you just bought yourself &quot;ear piercing&quot; and &quot;strange new feelings.&quot;</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Lisa's got school, career, posture.</p>
<p>Why did she have to steal Krusty from me?</p>
<p>Son, the healthy thing is to get rid of everything that reminds you of Krusty... which appears to be everything.</p>
<p>Hey, maybe we should give Lisa this room.</p>
<p>You know she works for Krusty now.</p>
<p>Okay, here's my offer: All this prim Krusty merchandise for that copy of &quot;Radioactive Man vs. Muhammad Ali.&quot;</p>
<p>My counter offer: &quot;Radioactive Man Meets the Kansas City Royals.&quot;</p>
<p>How about &quot;Radioactive Man vs.</p>
<p>Restless Leg Syndrome&quot;?</p>
<p>Let us try a different tack.</p>
<p>Are you interested in coin collecting?</p>
<p>Am I?! No.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>I will start you off with this bicentennial quarter and I will throw in my man scrunchie.</p>
<p>Uh, we'll stick with the coins.</p>
<p>Whoa, nice.</p>
<p>Everything in its place, nothin' festering inside of nothin'.</p>
<p>You've alphabetized my book collection.</p>
<p>I've never had such a great assistant.</p>
<p>I'm gonna call you &quot;The Goy Wonder.&quot;</p>
<p>Because I don't remember your name.</p>
<p><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content"><br />

<p>All right, time to fill these slots with coins.</p>
<p>Specific coins?</p>
<p>This hobby sucks.</p>
<p>Son, all hobbies suck.</p>
<p>But if you keep at it, you might find at the end that you've managed to k*ll some precious time.</p>
<p>Wow, I never thought of it like that.</p>
<p>Do you want to collect coins with your old man?</p>
<p>You bet I do!</p>
<p>To your mother's purse.</p>
<p>Take A penny Leave a penny.</p>
<p>Toll Booth.</p>
<p>Luck O' The lrish Wishing well.</p>
<p>What's you're doin' here? That's just my well!</p>
<p>You don't like swearing prayers around my well!</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>Well, what do you think of them apples?</p>
<p>I'll take all of ya.</p>
<p>No, don't put that... Oh, no, I'll never gets out!</p>
<p>Slide in the 1863 Confederate half dime and every slot is full.</p>
<p>This is the first book I've ever finished reading or pushing things into.</p>
<p>What the...? We missed one!</p>
<p>&quot;The lnverted Double-struck Penny&quot; or &quot;Kissing Lincolns' was mistakenly minted in December of 1917, when a brief glimpse of a woman's ankle caused three days of rioting at the Philadelphia Mint.&quot;</p>
<p>The one on the left looks into it, but the one on the right is just experimenting.</p>
<p>Son, we are getting that coin.</p>
<p>Here I am, walking the plank.</p>
<p>I wish this mean pirate wasn't poking me with his sword!</p>
<p>Where's the chimp?</p>
<p>Mr. Teeny's not here.</p>
<p>He's stuck in traffic.</p>
<p>Oh, what do I do?</p>
<p>I can't ad lib to save my life.</p>
<p>Oh, boy, oh, boy. Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of fun.</p>
<p>What are you doing, kid?</p>
<p>My job: making you look good.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, right. So, what be your name, matey?</p>
<p>Long John Seltzer!</p>
<p>The laughter swept over her like a wave, enveloping her in its intoxicating embrace.</p>
<p>The next week, Krusty went to his Lake Tahoe retreat ♪ for some R and R.</p>
<p>But he was about to get an unexpected visit from a third and fourth R, Ron Rabinowitz.</p>
<p>Krusty, I've been your agent for 45 years.</p>
<p>I am telling you, watch out for this Lisa Simpson character.</p>
<p>She has got a taste for Lady Laughter, and she will step right over a certain clown to get it.</p>
<p>Which clown? Chuckles?</p>
<p>Professor Nitwit?</p>
<p>No, you!</p>
<p>No Yu, the Chinese Clown?</p>
<p>Oh, great one, Krusty.</p>
<p>But seriously, you're in real trouble here.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>If there was a rehearsal for the network, I would've been told by my... assistant!</p>
<p>Well, where is he?</p>
<p>I don't know, I guess he forgot.</p>
<p>But people seemed to like me last week.</p>
<p>You stood in for Mr. Teeny.</p>
<p>How'd you like to stand in for Krusty?</p>
<p>Oh, well, it's one thing to fill in for a monkey.</p>
<p>But a comedy legend?</p>
<p>I wouldn't dream of it.</p>
<p>I respect that. Cancel the run-through.</p>
<p>Okay, I'll do the monologue.</p>
<p>Evening, Mr. Krusty.</p>
<p>Great show last...</p>
<p>Sorry, I can't act like you matter!</p>
<p>Have no fear, the star is here!</p>
<p>Shh! We're working!</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>So the centipede says: &quot;I'm goin'! I'm goin'!</p>
<p>I'm just putting on my shoes!&quot;</p>
<p>Now, that's well-performed comedy!</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Everything you said came true, Ron.</p>
<p>Uh, Ron?</p>
<p>So you'll come to the agency tomorrow and I'll introduce you to the whole team, okay?</p>
<p>You like egg white omelets?</p>
<p>I'll be waiting. You're a good girl.</p>
<p>I've been replaced by an eight-year-old.</p>
<p>I can be eight!</p>
<p>La, la, la, la.</p>
<p>I'm eight years old.</p>
<p>Krusty, you've learned that fame, that fickle beauty, can leave you when you need it most.</p>
<p>And Lisa had a lesson to learn as well.</p>
<p>A lesson about... You, there!</p>
<p>Cut that out!</p>
<p>Sorry, sorry.</p>
<p>Thank you, folks. You've been a great audience.</p>
<p>I'm gonna keep this forever!</p>
<p>All of Springfield fell head over heels for Lisa.</p>
<p>Here she comes.</p>
<p>Quick, switch from internal monologue to external dialogue!</p>
<p>Shall we visit the commissary to toast your success?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure, Mel.</p>
<p>Let me just wave one more good-bye to my fans.</p>
<p>While applause rained down on Lisa, poor Krusty found himself parched.</p>
<p>It's 3:32 a.m., which means it's time for.</p>
<p>Last Gasp with Krusty the Clown!</p>
<p>Brought to you by Nappien, Nok-em-Out and Nok-em-Out Jr. for kids.</p>
<p>Tonight's guest is local bully, Jimbo Jones?</p>
<p>This is the lowest I've ever sunk and I once made out with a blow-up doll.</p>
<p>Sorry you broke up with me now Cindy?</p>
<p>One of these has got to be that smooching Lincoln penny.</p>
<p>Nope. Nope. Dime. Button.</p>
<p>Pepperoni slice.</p>
<p>Wait!</p>
<p>This is a classic 1978 Pizza Hut!</p>
<p>Mmm... terrible.</p>
<p>Nope. Nope. Nope.</p>
<p>Son, coin collecting's a lot like life.</p>
<p>It stopped being fun a long time ago.</p>
<p>But unlike life, I have a solution for this.</p>
<p>Gavelby's Auction house.</p>
<p>Going once, going twice... sold to Mr. Burns!</p>
<p>I've won every coin.</p>
<p>But I feel strangely empty.</p>
<p>Ooh, there's another coin. That should do it.</p>
<p>Our last item up for bid is a mint condition 1917 &quot;Kissing Lincoln&quot; penny.</p>
<p>Okay, boy, this is it. Five dollars!</p>
<p>$500.</p>
<p>Five dollars cash!</p>
<p>Sir, the promise of cash is not an enticement.</p>
<p>The current bid is $500.</p>
<p>Do I hear a counter bid? Going once, going twice...Dad?</p>
<p>$501!</p>
<p>$10 million.</p>
<p>Objection, your honor.</p>
<p>Sir, I am not a judge.</p>
<p>But, um, overruled. Sold to Mr. Burns for $10 million!</p>
<p>I paid a pretty penny for this pretty penny, but it was worth it.</p>
<p>Mr. Burns, my son and I have been collecting coins.</p>
<p>It's really brought us closer together.</p>
<p>That penny you bought tonight would mean the world to him.</p>
<p>Yes, but the problem is, if you had it, I wouldn't.</p>
<p>You see difficulty.</p>
<p>Mmm. Yeah.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what, at least help me buy the boy a gumball.</p>
<p>Do you have change for a nickel?</p>
<p>Oh, of course.</p>
<p>Smithers, step on it!</p>
<p>I only gave him four cents for that nickel.</p>
<p>Monty Burns wins a...</p>
<p>And... done.</p>
<p>Now, let's put it on a shelf and never look at it again.</p>
<p>You got it, boy.</p>
<p>And so, bonded by love and larceny, father and son got dressed, had a minor disagreement...</p>
<p>You little... patched things up...</p>
<p>Sorry, Dad.</p>
<p>...and went downtown, where they watched proudly, as Lisa accepted her award.</p>
<p>Lisa, before you walk away from this venerable hall and into the arms of your adoring fans, may I have a moment?</p>
<p>Well, I do owe you everything. Make it quick.</p>
<p>Behold your fellow winners of the Entertainer of the Year Award.</p>
<p>Hmm. I don't recognize any of them.</p>
<p>And why should you?</p>
<p>He appears nightly on Broadway, selling combs and mints in the men's room.</p>
<p>She was fired after a bad rehearsal from Homeboys in Outer Space.</p>
<p>And perhaps the saddest one of all, he graced stages from London to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>When he played Biff in Death Of A Salesman, every woman in the audience wished they were Hap.</p>
<p>But that was before he... &quot;took the bone.&quot;</p>
<p>Melvin Van Horne.</p>
<p>Sideshow Mel?!</p>
<p>It's you!</p>
<p>How could this happen to you, to all these wonderful performers?</p>
<p>Applause is an addiction, like heroin or checking your e-mail.</p>
<p>Once you have a taste, you'll do anything to get more.</p>
<p>Don't end up like these people.</p>
<p>Don't end up like... me.</p>
<p>I need to get out while I still can.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mel.</p>
<p>Everyone, wait!</p>
<p>Um, there's someone I forgot to thank, and he's here tonight.</p>
<p>Krusty, will you come up on stage, please?</p>
<p>What do you want?</p>
<p>You've already taken everything I care about.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>So what else is in the news?</p>
<p>This just in: I don't give a crap.</p>
<p>I'm trying to set you up for laughs.</p>
<p>Trying to set me up with a giraffe?</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>You guys know about giraffes... long legs, big neck.</p>
<p>Here comes the zinger.</p>
<p>Speaking of necks, my girlfriend is a real pain in mine.</p>
<p>She crashed her car in to mine and said, &quot;Look, honey, we have a hybrid.&quot;</p>
<p>Timely.</p>
<p>By giving everything away, she was able to keep the only thing that mattered: her dignity.</p>
<p>God, how I envy her.</p>
<p>Ooh, I think I'm in love!</p>
<p>Krusty, please.</p>
<p>My wife is giving birth as we speak!</p>
<p>Just four more takes. Come on.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Oh, Krusty, have a heart.</p>
