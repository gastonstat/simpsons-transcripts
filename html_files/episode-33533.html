<p>Those two are monsters.<br />
Cut to them, you'll see.   </p>
<p>What are you filming us for?   </p>
<p><em>NARRATOR: Marge and Homer raised their three kids</em>   </p>
<p><em>in an atmosphere of love, laughter and crushing economic anxiety.</em>   </p>
<p><em>The only thing they needed was each other.</em>   </p>
<p>When I first met the Simpsons, in     , they were building affordable homes in Pennsylvania.   </p>
<p>Little Maggie was going to be the next Lindbergh baby.   </p>

<p>Don't interview Grampa.   </p>
<p>He almost made Ken Burns quit the business.   </p>
<p>[LAUGHS] That pompous old fool was more boring than baseball.   </p>

<p><em>Home to a nuclear power plant and an active volcano,</em>   </p>

<p>Tear <em>us</em> apart? Nothing can tear us apart.   </p>
<p>Tear us apart.   </p>
<p>- Mom, stop saying &quot;tear us apart.&quot;<br />
- It's tearing us apart!   </p>

<p><em>And just like that, Lisa's dream of going to college for three weeks,</em>   </p>

<p>It was not your typical break‐in.<br />
No sign of forced entry.   </p>
<p>I mean, the dog didn't even bark.   </p>
<p>Somebody knew exactly where to rub him. The tummy.   </p>

Oh, there's no way I'm barking.   </p>
<p>Oh, Lou, you got to teach my wife to do this.   </p>
<p><em>NARRATOR: With zero evidence of a break‐in,</em>   </p>
<p><em>police suspicion turned to the family.</em>   </p>
<p>This just didn't pass what cops call &quot;the smell test.&quot;   </p>
<p>I've watched a lot of cop shows in my day.   </p>
<p>I consider myself something of an amateur policeman. [CHUCKLES]   </p>

<p>We do not steal.   </p>
<p>That's borrowing.   </p>

<p><em>NARRATOR: And so this nuclear family began to explode,</em>   </p>
<p><em>as suspicion focused on one man.</em>   </p>
<p>Oh, what about the important clue the police missed?   </p>
<p>Somebody set a drink down here without a coaster.   </p>
<p>That had to be a stranger.   </p>
<p>This is an expensive table, and my family knows I don't want it stained.   </p>

<p>Homer's bar tab was spiraling out of control.    </p>
<p>Five, six hundred bucks.    </p>
<p>That night, Moe cut him off.    </p>
<p>[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]    </p>
<p>♪ I'm sorry... ♪    </p>
<p>Yeah, our theory was that Homer came home wasted, he fell, he shimmied and he found the money under the sink there, and he figured he'd just use it to pay his tab.    </p>
<p>Well it's indisputable that Homer visited the kitchen before going to bed. You see, we found spaghetti sauce splatter consistent with a very violent late‐night snack.    </p>
<p>This is, ah, this is not a <em>flayvin</em> situation.    </p>
<p>Although, I still am compelled to say <em>flayvin.</em>    </p>

<p>Ooh, Super Bowl in July!    </p>
<p>[CHUCKLES]    </p>
<p>No money in these pants.    </p>

<p>Now, that's some Cracker Jack detective work.    </p>
<p>[LAUGHS] Get it? Cracker Jack?    </p>
<p>[CHUCKLES] Yeah. Yeah. But as for evidence, we, uh, we got nothing.    </p>
<p>With Homer still the prime suspect, and the investigation stalled,    </p>
<p><em>Deadline: Springfield</em> was in dire straits.    </p>
<p>The show desperately needed a cliffhanger commercial break.    </p>
<p>What if the real criminal mastermind was billionaire Montgomery Burns?    </p>
<p>Why would I steal $   ?<br />
That's nothing to me.    </p>
<p>This is what rich is. Smithers, bring me some more money.    </p>
<p>Need more convincing?    </p>
<p>No. We'll be right back.    </p>
<p><em>NARRATOR: Police returned to their first theory:</em>    </p>

<p>Oh, definitely. Hey, you're gonna distort my voice for this, right?    </p>
<p>'Cause I don't want no one knowing that this is Moe Szyslak here.    </p>
<p>Oh, and cut the name, too, yeah?    </p>
<p><em>NARRATOR: As Moe Szyslak said, Homer was definitely a suspect.</em>    </p>
<p>It was pretty clear, Chief liked Homer Simpson for this case.    </p>
<p>Well, geez, Lou, I wouldn't say that I liked‐liked him.    </p>
<p>I just, uh... why, did he say something about me?    </p>
<p>I mean you thought he was a person of interest.    </p>
<p>Shut up. I can find someone interesting without being interested in them. Shut up.    </p>
<p>Yeah, but then new evidence came in that apparently cleared Homer.    </p>
<p>Phone records showed a six‐hour call from Homer's phone to a third party on the night of the crime.    </p>
<p>The DNA revealed that it was a butt dial.    </p>
