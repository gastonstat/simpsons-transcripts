<p>[ Groaning ] Stupid movies.</p>
<p>Who invented these dumb things anyway? Was it you, Bart?</p>
<p>It was Thomas Edison, Dad.</p>
<p>I thought he invented the lightbulb.</p>
<p>That too. He also invented the phonograph, the microphone and the electric car.</p>
<p>No one man can do all that.</p>
<p>You're a liar, honey- a dirty, rotten liar.</p>

<p>Omit no detail, however small or filthy.</p>
<p>So anyway, and this is the part you'll remember for the rest of your lives-</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Great story, Lenny.</p>
<p>But here's one that's even more spellbinding.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a man named Thomas Edison... and he invented the dictating machine and the fluoroscope... and the repeating telegraph.</p>
<p>[ Snoring ]</p>
<p>And he was a firm believer in Fletcherism... and he played the organ and his favorite flower was the heliotrope.</p>
<p>Oh, and his middle name was Alva... and he never, ever, <em>ever</em> wore pajamas.</p>
<p>Okay. I think we've been polite long enough here.</p>
<p>Lenny, what happened with the dame in the bathing suit?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Oh. Uh-</p>
<p>Oh, nuts. I forgot.</p>
<p>All I can think of now is Edison. I can't even remember where I work.</p>
<p>Well, I remember where Edison worked. It was Menlo Park.</p>
<p>That's where he came up with the tasimeter, the ore separator and-</p>
<p>Uh, James Watt invented the steam engine.</p>
<p>That's boring. You're boring everybody.</p>
<p>Quit boring everyone!</p>
<p><em>And then he worked on a machine to communicate with the dead.</em></p>
<p>[ Groans ]</p>
<p>Some kind of scary telephone, I guess.</p>
<p>Maybe he planned to stick his head under the ground and yell.</p>
<p>All right already!</p>
<p>Everyone knows the man accomplished a lot.</p>
<p>Maybe because he didn't spend every waking moment talking about Thomas Edison.</p>
<p>Oh, that's where you're wrong, Marge.</p>
<p>He was a shameless self-promoter.</p>
<p>Well, you're not Thomas Edison.</p>
<p>Marge, that's it! That's why I haven't done anything with my life.</p>
<p>I need to be more like Thomas Edison.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>And I'm starting right now.</p>
<p>No more lousy pajamas! [ Grunts ]</p>
<p>From this day forward, I am an inventor!</p>
<p>Do us a favor. Invent yourself some underpants.</p>
<p>♪ [ Whistling ]</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Well, I quit my job just like you said to.</p>
<p>I didn't tell you to quit your job.</p>
<p>Yes, you did. I remember your exact words.</p>
<p>You said I should quit my job and become an inventor, or you'd torch the house.</p>
<p>That doesn't sound like me.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose if this doesn't work out, you can always go back to the plant.</p>
<p>[ Chuckling ] Not the way I quit.</p>
<p>Whoo-hoo.</p>
<p>At my age, Edison had already invented 203 things.</p>
<p>Uh, I got a lot of work to do to catch up to him.</p>
<p>Let's see now. Invention. Invention.</p>
<p>Hmm. Hmm.</p>
<p>Something electrical might be good.</p>
<p>[ Muttering ] Let me handle the creative end of this, Marge.</p>
<p>You don't understand how the creative mind works like I do.</p>
<p>Oh?</p>
<p>You look at this table and what do you see? Just a table.</p>
<p>Now a creative person like me looks at this table... and sees all kinds of creative things, but no tables.</p>
<p>Homer, that's not a table. That's our dryer.</p>

<p>[ Grunting, Shouts ]</p>
<p>As long as you're here annoying me, let's have a brainstorming session.</p>
<p>And here's how it works. Lisa, you say one thing, then Bart, you say another.</p>
<p>Just toss out things and I'll use my inventive mind... to combine them into a brilliant, original idea.</p>
<p>Okay. Um-</p>
<p>Automatic-</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>Booger.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Yeah.</p>

<p>Okay, that's it. Both of you go to your rooms and spank yourselves.</p>
<p>Lazy father.</p>
<p>Can't even spank his own kids.</p>
<p>Homer, you can't punish the children just because you can't come up with an idea.</p>
<p>I don't see why not. They're my kids. I own 'em.</p>
<p>[ Groans ]</p>
<p>Okay. <em>We</em> own 'em.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>I brought you a tuna sandwich. They say it's brain food.</p>
<p>I guess because there's so much dolphin in it...</p>
<p><em>and you know how smart they are.</em></p>
<p>[ Groans ] It's no use.</p>
<p>I can't work like this, cut off from the scientific community.</p>
<p>You stay here and guard my sandwich.</p>
<p><em>And these should give you the grounding you'll need...</em> in thermodynamics, hypermathematics... and, of course, microcalifragilistics. [ Babbles ]</p>
<p>[ Groans ] Look, I just wanna know how to invent things. Tell me.</p>
<p>Uh, all you have to do is think of things that people need... but which don't exist yet.</p>
<p>You mean like an electric blanket-mobile?</p>
<p>Uh, well, possibl-</p>
<p>Or you could take something that already exists and find a new use for it. Like-</p>
<p>Hamburger earmuffs!</p>
<p>Uh, well, I suppose that would qualify-</p>
<p>Thanks, sucker!</p>
<p>[ Stammering ] All right.Just stay calm, Frinky.</p>
<p>These babies will be in the stores... while he's still grappling with the pickle matrix.</p>
<p>[ Babbling ]</p>

<p>Now, here's my &quot;Everything's Okay&quot; alarm.</p>
<p>[ Alarm Blaring ]</p>
<p>[ Shouting ] This will sound every three seconds... unless something isn't okay.</p>
<p>Turn that off, Homer.</p>
<p>[ Alarm Continues ]</p>
<p>It <em>can't</em> be turned off.</p>
<p>[ Alarm Slows, Stops ]</p>
<p>But it, uh, does break easily.</p>
<p>Now this next one's for the ladies.</p>
<p>How many times have you gals been late for a high-powered business meeting... only to realize you're not wearing makeup?</p>
<p>That's every woman's nightmare.</p>
<p>That's why I invented this revolutionary makeup g*n.</p>
<p>It's for the woman who only has four-fifths of a second to get ready.</p>
<p>Close your eyes, Marge.</p>
<p>And now you're ready for a night on the town.</p>
<p>[ Gasps ]</p>
<p>Homer, you've got it set on &quot;whore.&quot;</p>
<p>Uh, oop- Okay.</p>
<p>This time, try to keep your nostrils closed.</p>
<p>Oh, look what you did. Now I have to go get my cold cream g*n.</p>
<p>Dad, women won't like being sh*t in the face.</p>
<p>Women will like what I tell 'em to like. Now here's something for everyone.</p>
<p>In the olden times, if you were watching TV and nature called... you'd have to get up and walk to the bathroom.</p>
<p>It was the hardest thing in the world to do.</p>
<p>But now, with the Lazy Man Reclining Toilet Chair... you can just lean back and let 'er rip.</p>
<p>You expect people to go to the bathroom in their living rooms?</p>
<p>Sure. Believe me, every man in America will want to have one.</p>
<p>[ Flushes ]</p>
<p>Gangway! Gotta poop.</p>
<p>No, Bart!</p>
<p>Homer, all these inventions, they're-</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>Oh-They're not very-</p>
<p>Yes? Yes? Yes?</p>
<p>They're terrible.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I'm not saying you're a bad inventor.</p>
<p>I'm just saying these particular... inventions are awful... and no one in their right mind would buy them or accept them as gifts.</p>
<p>But this is the best I could do.</p>
<p>I guess I'm no better at being Thomas Edison than I was at being Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>Oh, dear. I hope I wasn't too rough on him.</p>
<p>Somebody had to tell him, Mom. In the long run, it's much kinder to-</p>
<p><em>[ Clears Throat ] Do you mind?</em></p>

<p>Homer!</p>
<p>[ Together] Dad!</p>
<p>[ Shouts ] Huh?</p>
<p>What happened? You didn't fall.</p>
<p>Oh, that.</p>
<p>I stuck a couple extra legs on there...</p>
<p>'cause I kept tipping over when I was trying to invent stuff.</p>
<p>They're on hinges. That's really ingenious, Dad.</p>
<p>It could save lives.</p>
<p>Really? You think it's a good idea?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Safety sells, especially to lame-o's.</p>

<p>I did it! I'm gonna be rich!</p>
<p>♪ [ Humming ]</p>
<p>Look, Mr. Edison. I did it! I'm an inventor.</p>
<p>And I owe it all to you.</p>
<p>See? It's just a regular chair... but I attached a couple of extra legs to the back... kind of like the ones on the back of your-</p>
<p>Oh, damn it!</p>
<p>Hey, Dad. Heard you swearin'. Mind if I join in? Crap, boobs, crap!</p>
<p>I thought I had a great idea... but I must have seen it on this poster.</p>
<p>If Edison thought of that chair, how come it's not on this chart?</p>
<p>It's not? Maybe he never told anyone about it.</p>
<p>That chair might be the only one he made.</p>
<p>So?</p>
<p>So, we've got to go to the Edison Museum and smash it!</p>
<p>Then I'll be an inventor.</p>
<p>But I thought you loved Edison.</p>
<p>Ah, the hell with him.</p>
<p>Yeah! Hell, damn, fart!</p>
<p><em>[ Tires Screeching ]</p>
<p>Taking Bart cross state lines. Back soon.</p>
<p>I took your wallet.!</em></p>
<p>Oh, I just mopped that driveway.</p>
<p>Man, I can't wait to smash that chair.</p>
<p>[ Chuckling ] Oh, Son.</p>
<p>You're young and headstrong just like Thomas Edison Jr.</p>
<p>You know, he started a mushroom farm and an auto parts company... and he sold his good name to a quack medicine company.</p>
<p>Oh, and later he raised turkeys. That was on his turkey farm.</p>
<p><em>[ Snoring ]</em></p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Mmm. Mmm.</p>
<p>[ Muttering, Gasps ]</p>
<p>Stop, Homer!</p>
<p>[ Gasps ]</p>
<p>By smashing my chair, you're only hurting yourself.</p>
<p>[ Growls ]</p>
<p>[ Yelping, Grunts ]</p>
<p>I'll get you, you fat lunatic!</p>
<p>[ Tires Screeching ]</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>[ Whimpering ]</p>
<p>[ Panting ]</p>
<p>All right! The museum's still open.</p>
<p>Why don't you like Edison that much?</p>
<p>[ Grunts ]</p>
<p>Hey, folks. Do you like riddles?</p>
<p>[ Chattering ]</p>
<p>Okay, then.</p>
<p>How many geniuses does it take to invent a lightbulb?</p>
<p>Just one: Thomas Edison.</p>
<p>[ Laughter, Applause ]</p>
<p>That's very good.</p>
<p>And that's true too. It's funny and true.</p>
<p>Now behind that door is Edison's actual preserved brain.</p>
<p>[ Gasping ]</p>
<p>Ordinarily, folks, tour groups are not allowed to see it... and, of course, today will be no exception.</p>
<p>[ Groaning ]</p>
<p>Now no tour would be complete without a visit to Edison's boyhood gift shop.</p>
<p>[ Chattering ]</p>
<p><em>[ Chattering Continues ]</em></p>
<p>Now let's take care of business.</p>
<p>Out of the way.</p>
<p>This is one invention you're not getting credit for, you inspiration hog.</p>
<p>Your electric hammer, maestro?</p>
<p>Invent your way out of this, Edison! Hmm?</p>
<p><em>Hmm.</p>
<p>[ Gasps ] Look, Son. Edison was just like me.</em></p>
<p>You mean the wild mood swings?</p>
<p>No! We both lived in another man's shadow.</p>
<p>This old-timey nerd and I have suffered the same frustration and heartache.</p>
<p>We're not rivals.</p>
<p>We're just a couple of dreamers who set the bar a little too high.</p>
<p>I can't destroy your work, my friend.</p>
<p>Can I?</p>
<p>No, but we'll stop off at the da Vinci museum on the way home.</p>
<p>Uh, I think that's in ltaly, Dad.</p>
<p>Oh. Well, then we'll take it out on Eli Whitney.</p>
<p><em>Authorities say the phony pope...</em> can be recognized by his high-top sneakers and incredibly foul mouth.</p>
<p>In other news, Thomas Edison, the greatest inventor of all time- [ Both Gasp ] is apparently still inventing... despite the notable handicap of being dead.</p>
<p>That's my Tommy!</p>
<p>[ Brockman ] Two new Edison creations have just been discovered in his museum.</p>
<p>A six-legged chair that won't tip over- [ Applause ] and even more astounding, an electric hammer.</p>
<p><em>[ Applause ]</p>
<p>[ Camera Shutters Clicking ]</em></p>
<p>That was your idea.</p>
<p>This brilliant innovation is expected to generate millions... for Edison's already-wealthy heirs.</p>
<p>[ Laughing ]</p>
<p>Dad, those should be your millions.</p>
<p>I gotta admit, Homer. You're takin' this pretty well.</p>
<p>Let's just say I'm sitting in the right chair.</p>
<p>[ Murmuring ]</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
