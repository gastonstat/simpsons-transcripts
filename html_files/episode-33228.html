- Sorry, Dad, but it looks like I've conquered you at Risk,  </p>
<p>- bankrupted you at Monopoly...<br />
- HOMER: Hmm. Hmm. and aggravated you at Aggravation.  </p>
<p>Well, with you as a daughter, I'm a winner in the game of Life.  </p>
<p>Although, I lost that, too.  </p>
<p>[GRUNTS] Such a good father.   </p>
<p>Everyone is really getting along.   </p>
<p>What the hell is going on?   </p>
<p>There's no Bart.   </p>
<p>- You're right.<br />
- Where is he?   </p>
<p>Ladies, relax.   </p>
<p>Remember when I said I'd punish Bart after he got us... banned from the buffet?   </p>
<p>[BART CHUCKLES]   </p>
<p>I can't shut it off.   </p>
<p>Someone wedged a seasonal Tuscan focaccia in the lever!   </p>
<p>[LAUGHS]   </p>
<p>Well, Homie, whatever punishment you gave him must have worked.   </p>
<p>Yep, tough love. I'm his father, not his best friend.   </p>
<p>He'll hate me now, but someday he'll say wonderful things about me to people on airplanes who just want to go to sleep.   </p>
<p>- That young man will...<br />
- How did you punish him?   </p>
<p>Well, I sat the boy down, looked him straight in the eye, and bought him a top-of-the-line computer gaming rig.   </p>
<p>- You what?<br />
- I get it. You bribed him.   </p>
<p>Stay out of this. I did not bribe him.   </p>
<p>I addicted him to something that will numb his spirit until he's no longer our responsibility.   </p>
<p>Well, it has been pretty peaceful around here.   </p>
<p>k*ll! Die! Die! Get wrecked, newbs!   </p>
<p>[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]   </p>
<p>This is General Splattin'. Do you copy?   </p>
<p>- Copy.<br />
- BOTH: Copy.   </p>
<p>Jinx. You me a Coke.   </p>
<p>[GROANS] I'll never be able to pay that bet.   </p>
<p>Focus, Nelson, focus.   </p>
<p>Kite the enemy into a gank.<br />
Squeeze it...   </p>
<p>- on three... two...<br />
- [expl*si*n]   </p>
<p>GG!   </p>
<p>That means &quot;good game.&quot;   </p>
<p>It's how the other team lets you know... they surrender!   </p>
<p>HOMER: Mm.   </p>
<p>Now I hit control-six to defile their corpses.   </p>
<p>Haw-haw! Haw-haw!   </p>
<p>- Haw-haw!<br />
- [CHICKENS CLUCKING]   </p>
<p>[DANCE MUSIC PLAYS]   </p>
<p>Civilized annihilation.   </p>
<p>Marge, the boy just may be learning some life k*ll.   </p>
<p>Mom, do you agree with this?   </p>
<p>I guess so. Your father is showing an interest in Bart, which is good.   </p>
<p>Well, if that's how things work, then I'm gonna behave badly, too.   </p>
<p>[BOTH LAUGHING]   </p>
<p>- That's great!<br />
- Sure you are.   </p>
<p>I'll show you! I'm gonna... tear up my homework.   </p>
<p>[LISA GROANS]   </p>
<p>I'm really gonna do this. Here I go.   </p>
<p>[GROANS] Actually, this bibliography could be improved.   </p>

<p>[SHOWER RUNNING]   </p>
<p>Bart's been in the shower for an hour.   </p>
<p>[CHUCKLES] With a young man that age, there's only one reason he's in the bathroom that long.   </p>
<p>Skunk sprayed him good.   </p>
<p>Oh, my God, he's playing with himself!   </p>
<p>On that game.   </p>
<p>He's playing that game in the shower?   </p>
<p>We have to stop this right now.   </p>
<p>Homer, take care of your son.   </p>
<p>Make him quit. [GROANS] Geez.   </p>
<p>Sorry, boy, I have to put my foot down.   </p>
<p>I can't quit now.   </p>
<p>My team's about to compete in a tournament.   </p>
<p>I can't let them down.   </p>
<p>Well, team building is important.   </p>
<p>All right, let yourself go, and your partner will support you.   </p>
<p>[LENNY SCREAMS, GROANS]   </p>
<p>Damn you, Homer!   </p>
<p>Please, Dad, can I play in this one last tournament?   </p>
<p>Sorry, boy, you're through.   </p>
<p>First prize is a thousand bucks.   </p>
<p>You get paid to play video games?   </p>
<p>A thousand bucks.   </p>
<p>- They actually pay you?<br />
- Yes.   </p>
<p>- In dollars?<br />
- Yes.   </p>
<p>- To play a video game?<br />
- That's right.   </p>
<p>- They pay you in cash?<br />
- Yes, yes, yes!   </p>
<p>- How much?<br />
- A thousand!   </p>
<p>All right. Do not tell your mom, but I'm gonna say yes, one last tournament.   </p>
<p>Oh, thank you, Dad.   </p>
<p>Just one thing... they actually pay you?    </p>
<p>Yes!    </p>
<p>A thousand dollars to play video games?    </p>
<p>[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]    </p>
<p>Group up.<br />
Time to put these suckers away.    </p>
<p>Oh, yeah, show me some Gs, Odgenville.    </p>
<p>We win! And it's all because I let them do it.    </p>
<p>Now, apparently, the Evergreen Terrors have won, uh, this thing I don't understand at all, but which gave the school new basketball nets.    </p>
<p>Now to hand you your prize money, which is $ ,    cash.    </p>
<p>Let go, Seymour.    </p>
<p>I'm telling myself to.    </p>
<p>I've never held this much money in my hand all at once.    </p>
<p>Let me just, uh... [CHUCKLES] look at it.    </p>
<p>$    bill, autographed by Lawrence Summers.    </p>
<p>Such a carefree signature, before the Great Recession.    </p>
<p>HOMER: Mm.    </p>
<p>Here you go, $    each. Mm!    </p>
<p>Okay, team, take a break and meet up for practice in   .    </p>
<p>My dad said we could all go to Krusty Burger.    </p>
<p>Is he giving us a discount?    </p>
<p>No, he just said we could go.    </p>
<p>It'll be nice to have some kids in there again, after what the monkey did during that birthday party. [GROANS]    </p>
<p>Whatever. Just meet in   .    </p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<br />
You know what, kids?    </p>
<p>I'm gonna blow your minds with a little bit of hard-earned advice:    </p>
<p>- Quit while you're ahead.<br />
- KIDS: Huh?    </p>
<p>We can't quit. There's so many more tournaments.    </p>
<p>You won one video game tournament.    </p>
<p>This isn't like baseball or politics where you can make real money.    </p>
<p>You only have one childhood, kids. Enjoy it.    </p>
<p>Okay, but because we came in first we qualified for a tournament where we could win $   ,   .    </p>
<p>Childhood's over. It's time for work.    </p>
<p>[CELL PHONE BUZZING]    </p>
<p>Hmm. Hmm?    </p>
<p>That's right, sweetie.    </p>
<p>I'm going to make your brother a champion.    </p>
<p>Knock off that racket!    </p>
<p>You're gonna defy Mom?    </p>
<p>- Sit on my knee, boy.<br />
- I think I'm too old.    </p>
<p>You're never too old to sit on Daddy's knee.    </p>
<p>- [BONES CRACK]<br />
- Ow, my knee! Get off! Get off!    </p>
<p>[GROANING]    </p>
<p>Son, here's a life lesson:    </p>
<p>I don't directly tell your mother anything bad.    </p>
<p>I secretly make her a part of everything she's against.    </p>
<p>That's why I spent your winnings on her.    </p>
<p>Honey, I got you a present.    </p>
<p>MARGE [GASPS]: An espresso pod machine, like the one I made fun of at the Hibberts'.    </p>
<p>Because you wanted it yourself.<br />
Let me pod you, my dear.    </p>
<p>- [MACHINE WHIRRING]<br />
- Ooh! What's the occasion?    </p>
<p>The occasion is that I haven't been as good of a father as I should.    </p>
<p>Yes. Well, no, uh...    </p>
<p>Don't argue. It's true.    </p>
<p>I need to get more involved in Bart's life, so I've decided to be his coach.    </p>
<p>That's wonderful. Coaching what?    </p>
<p>Oh, I haven't landed on it yet.    </p>
<p>Football, chess, maybe even a silly video game.    </p>
<p>It doesn't matter. Have some coffee.    </p>
<p>I love how it doesn't fill the cup.    </p>
<p>Very European. Mmm.    </p>
<p>- It's a video game.<br />
- What?    </p>
<p>I guess if you're spending time together, what's the harm?    </p>
<p>[SINGSONGY]: Look who's a dad.<br />
Look who's a dad.    </p>
<p>I knew you'd be cool with it.    </p>
<p>Also, I hired a video game expert to tutor Bart.    </p>
<p>His name is The Detonator.    </p>
<p>- [GROANS]<br />
- [DOORBELL RINGS]    </p>
<p>&quot;I can't make conversation unless it's about gaming.&quot;    </p>
<p>Do you want to come in?    </p>
<p>Do you want to go where they're playing the game?    </p>
<p>Thank you, ma'am.    </p>
<p>Homer, I've watched Bart play... here, on his Twitch feed, and his HitForm, InstaBox, Gibtrack, Buzuba, and YergaPunch streams.    </p>
<p>Hmm, the only word I recognized was Gibtrack.    </p>
<p>I think Bart has what it takes to be top ten.    </p>
<p>- Players? In the country?<br />
- Bigger.    </p>
<p>- The galaxy?<br />
- Smaller.    </p>
<p>- World?<br />
- Yes.    </p>
<p>Whoo-hoo.    </p>
<p>Kids, make sure you're in a chair that spins.    </p>
<p>You're all gonna get a lesson from The Detonator.    </p>
<p>Let's jump into a battle.    </p>
<p>To start, Bart and Nelson, we'll put you up front, and we'll back you up with Sophie and Milhouse.    </p>
<p>Booyah!    </p>
<p>THE DETONATOR: Notice my finger is clicking the mouse with a light, quick stroke to limit joint fatigue and tracking error.    </p>
<p>I'm clicking like the mouse button is hot.    </p>
<p>Not too hot; like the top of a toaster after an underdone bagel.    </p>
<p>Okay, now I'm using that quick mouse stroke here and here, which is how, Bart, you should drop diamonite mines to surround their spawn points.    </p>
<p>Milhouse, make sure you're in position to respond to enemy aggression.    </p>
<p>Sophie, when they make their move, go in and engage.    </p>
<p>My dad's been engaged    times. I know what to do.    </p>
<p>Okay, now we're entering the mid-game, where it's important to keep focusing on major objectives and control the map.    </p>
<p>Okay, Homer, you watch the screen while I take a quick A.P.    </p>
<p>What's an A.P.?    </p>
<p>It's a gamer abbreviation for &quot;a pee.&quot;    </p>
<p>Nerd lingo. Saves so much time.    </p>
<p><em>THE DETONATOR [OVER HEADSETS]: All right, I'm walking</em>    </p>
<p><em>through the kitchen,</em>    </p>

<p><em>I'm making eye contact.</em>    </p>
<p><em>MARGE: Your shoes have lace holes but no laces.</em>    </p>
<p><em>THE DETONATOR: Linoleum, linoleum.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Strafing into the bathroom, gonna go into defuel mode.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Lifting seat with shoe.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Pro tip: Going over the belt saves time.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Shaking, flushing and hand washing</em>    </p>
<p><em>are the real time k*ll.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Once I cut those out, my lag time went way down.</em>    </p>
<p>Okay, these Water Mages have fuel t*nk on their backs, so you can't hit them with standard spells, but if I equip this staff that lets me cast lava quadballs...    </p>
<p>I mistimed it. Oh, God, I mistimed. They k*ll me.    </p>
<p>Do you mind if I dance over your corpse?    </p>
<p>I'd be mad if you didn't.    </p>
<p>- It's over for me.<br />
- Why?    </p>
<p>I just lost my gaming edge.<br />
Right there, just now.    </p>
<p>Been in the zone for years, and now I'm not.    </p>

<p>Anyway, I'm gonna go work for my uncle. He owns a tile store.    </p>
<p>It'll be a good life. Good enough.    </p>
