<p>NARRATOR: <em>It was the biggest scandal</em>   </p>
<p><em>in the history of Springfield sports.</em>   </p>
<p><em>Never has someone fallen from such heights to such lows,</em>   </p>
<p><em>except maybe for that tightrope walker who sneezed.</em>   </p>
<p><em>That was terrible.</em>   </p>
<p>This situation is a disgusting mockery of a repulsive joke that would make me sick to my stomach if there was there was one good restaurant in this town, which there is not!   </p>
<p>(stammers) There is nothing to vomit.   </p>
<p>NARRATOR:<em> And all because of one young man.</em>   </p>
<p>Okay, so I shaved points in basketball.   </p>
<p>Just don't make a big production of it.   </p>
<p>NARRATOR: <em>This is</em>    for   .   </p>

<p>I always thought he'd work for gamblers with the mob.   </p>
<p>In the morning, we saw the horrors of the beaches at Iwo Jima.   </p>
<p>DIRECTOR: This is a sports documentary.   </p>
<p>I'm getting there!   </p>
<p>In my unit, they called me &quot;Quarterback.&quot;   </p>
<p>Because when I borrowed a quarter, I never gave it back.   </p>
<p>At the end of the w*r, I had a buck   , and no friends.   </p>
<p>(distorted): I remember it like it was yesterday.   </p>
<p>Or maybe the day before that.   </p>
<p>It all started with a prank.   </p>
<p>Bart had no idea where it would lead.   </p>
<p>This voice is scaring me.   </p>
<p>I need Puppy Goo-Goo!   </p>
<p>(normal voice): Safety kiss!   </p>

<p>Yeah, so here was the quote, unquote &quot;prank.&quot;   </p>

<p>Fame went to Bart's head.    </p>
<p>Just once, I'd like to see science go to his head.    </p>
<p>He's got more D's than Dolly Parton!    </p>
<p>I'm not sure what that means, but please use the joke.    </p>

<p>What the hell is that thing doing in a gym?!    </p>

<p>NARRATOR:<em> But the boy who could spin a ball with his doodle</em>    </p>
<p><em>was about to learn a very tough lesson.</em>    </p>
<p>BART: _    </p>
<p>FAT TONY: _    </p>
<p>BART: _    </p>
<p>NARRATOR:<em> Fat Tony denied he'd made any money,</em>    </p>
<p><em>but this FBI footage suggests otherwise.</em>    </p>
<p>I thought I was just keeping the score down to get back at my Dad, but Fat Tony was betting against us, every game.    </p>
<p>I<em> was</em> a patsy.    </p>
<p>Ow! She didn't mean that.    </p>
<p>D'oh! Ow! Ow!    </p>
<p>I was scared, Milhouse scared.    </p>
<p>Why do you keep cutting to me?    </p>
<p>And then it got worse.    </p>
<p>Fat Tony told me to lose the finals.    </p>
<p>Not win by a little, but lose or else.    </p>
<p>&quot;Or else&quot;?    </p>
<p>My client does not speak like that.    </p>
<p>Yeah, now drop the subject, or else.    </p>
<p>Edit that out, or else.    </p>
<p>I-I'm gonna stop talking... or else.    </p>
<p>Damn it.    </p>
<p>NARRATOR: <em>What did Fat Tony say to Bart?</em>    </p>
<p><em>His capo, Johnny Tightlips, refused to talk.</em>    </p>
<p>Anyone here own a black Lincoln Continental, license plate, &quot;Zero to Say&quot;?    </p>
<p>It's being towed.    </p>
<p>Sir, you're the only one here.    </p>
<p>I saw you get out of it.    </p>
<p>Yeah, maybe it is. Maybe I am.    </p>
<p>Maybe you did. Or maybe it's not.    </p>
<p>And I'm not, and you didn't.    </p>
<p>But you didn't hear this, that, or the other thing.    </p>
<p>Or maybe you did.    </p>
<p>Hey! My granny's in there!    </p>
<p>Shaving points was one thing, but he wanted me to lose.    </p>
<p>I let down my team. I let down my town.    </p>
<p>So, I guess this is where I break down and cry.    </p>
<p>(crying)    </p>
<p>Hey, I'm the one who's supposed to cry.    </p>
<p>No. This is my story.    </p>

<p>ANGER WATKINS: Another bucket by Bart Simpson!    </p>
<p>His sloppy play is a distant memory, like Nelson's father.    </p>
<p>Yeah, interesting side note:    </p>
<p>Nelson left a ticket for his father in case he showed up.    </p>
<p>And he did show up, but then he sold the ticket without seeing Nelson, and he skipped town again.    </p>
<p>You believe that?    </p>
<p>Rejected!    </p>
<p>Like I've been rejected.    </p>
<p>Nothing but net!    </p>
<p>Which is what my mom wears in the strip club.    </p>
<p>It was in the third quarter when the game really got weird, and I got a low bar for weird.    </p>
<p>(grunts)    </p>
<p>Bart went to sh**t, and took a hard foul from his own best friend.    </p>
<p>♪ ♪    </p>
<p>Let's just say Bart wasn't the only one Fat Tony had gotten to.    </p>
<p>This<em> was</em> my bobblehead.    </p>
<p>They got to him, in my bedroom, where he bobbled.    </p>
<p>Hey, let's just say that bobblehead won't be attending no more giveaway days.    </p>
<p>You keep sh**ting your mouth, you'll wind up in that building going up on Third Street.    </p>
<p>It's a Third Street address, but actually you enter on Lincoln.    </p>
<p>Yet another secret revealed!    </p>
<p>I'm sorry, Dad. I was a jerk.    </p>
<p>The good thing about being a kid is you get to make mistakes so you don't make them as an adult.    </p>
<p>Thanks, Dad.    </p>
<p>But don't you still make mistakes?    </p>
<p>The best one was you, son. Aw.    </p>
<p>Now go win that game!    </p>
<p>NARRATOR: <em>And win he did.</em>    </p>
<p>He blew our net budget for the next ten years.    </p>
<p>(buzzer blares)    </p>
<p>NARRATOR: <em>But not everyone was cheering.</em>    </p>
<p>Is he going for a g*n?    </p>
<p>(sighs): Oh.    </p>
<p>- Get me a g*n.<br />
- (screams)    </p>
<p>We thought we were goners.    </p>
<p>Our lives flashed before our eyes.    </p>
<p>I had a lot of crazy jobs.    </p>
<p>And then the cavalry came on her stupid high horse.    </p>
<p>LISA: Let them go.    </p>
<p>Really? And what do you have on me?    </p>
<p>The goods.    </p>
<p>The goods? Oh, that sounds bad.    </p>
<p>Fat Tony, may I speak to you in Italian?    </p>
<p>I don't know Italian.    </p>
<p>How about Sicilian?    </p>
<p>That's a language?    </p>
<p>How about I say it like Porky Pig?    </p>
<p>E-ba-dee, e-ba-dee, e-ba-dee, e-ba-dee, e-ba-dee...    </p>
<p>Say what you got to say.    </p>
<p>Turns out I'm the hero of this documentary.    </p>
<p>I think that deserves a chyron.    </p>
<p>It happens that Fat Tony had a secret, a secret I had uncovered with a little bit of research.    </p>
<p><em>I wondered, if Fat Tony liked basketball so much,</em>    </p>
<p><em>why didn't he play?</em>    </p>
<p><em>Turns out he had.</em>    </p>
<p><em>For a girls' team.</em>    </p>
<p><em>And if there's one thing a Mafia boss doesn't want known,</em>    </p>
<p><em>it's that he was the third-string sh**ting guard</em>    </p>
<p><em>on the Springfield Little Debbies.</em>    </p>
<p>You keep quiet about what you know.    </p>
<p>All of you keep quiet!    </p>
<p>Keep quiet about what, boss?    </p>
<p>The man Spanx you wear?    </p>
<p>Your high school nickname, Robert DeZero?    </p>
<p>The way you cried at<em> Toy Story  ?</em>    </p>
<p>That's not even the sad one.    </p>
<p>What? What?    </p>
<p>Why do you keep talking?    </p>
<p>I'm sorry. It's a nervous condition.    </p>
<p>Can you give me the name of that secret shrink you see?    </p>
<p>So, we made a deal.    </p>
<p>I'd forget if Fat Tony forgave.    </p>
<p>But now the secret's out.    </p>
<p>It's in a documentary.    </p>
<p>No one watches those, unless it's a documentary where a rich guy k*ll people and no one knows about it.    </p>
<p>As far as you know. (chuckles)    </p>
<p>BURNS: I'm guilty, guilty, guilty.    </p>
<p>SMITHERS: Sir, you know you're on mic.    </p>
<p>BURNS: Who is this Mike you're speaking of?    </p>
<p>We'll k*ll him, too!    </p>
<p>NARRATOR:<em> But all sports stories have an upside,</em>    </p>
<p><em>unless you're a Detroit Lions fan.</em>    </p>
<p>So this young man, showboat and friend of the mob, gets off with not even a slap on the wrist.    </p>
<p>It's a travesty wrapped in outrage, marinated in a sauce of everything's gone to hell!    </p>
<p>I admit, it was fun.    </p>
<p>For a short time, we had our own little superstar.    </p>
<p>And he kept playing.    </p>
<p>Then he ran up against one tall kid,    </p>
<p><em>and found out he really wasn't that good.</em>    </p>
<p>But Lisa, Lisa had a real talent for journalism.    </p>
