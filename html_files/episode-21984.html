							<p>The PTA Disbands.</p>
<p>This bus has seen better days.</p>
<p>Well, at least it's safer than the old bus.</p>
<p>Time to move. The hole's getting bigger.</p>
<p>Seymour, the children are playing in the hole again.</p>
<p>Shouldn't you get that fixed?</p>
<p>Edna, you know they just cut the school's budget.</p>
<p>If I had the money, I'd fix the exhaust leak.</p>
<p>I think it's causing some of our low test scores.</p>
<p>The battlefield is just a half-mile ahead.</p>
<p>Begin braking procedure!</p>
<p>This Civil w*r cannon has been fully restored and is in ready-to-fire condition.</p>
<p>But it's a good thing we're not firing it... because it happens to be aimed at the main support leg of that lookout tower.</p>
<p>People don't realize that these cannons are very sensitive... and the slightest jolt could set them off.</p>
<p>Of course, for safety reasons... we don't keep the cannon loaded.</p>
<p>It's just common sense.</p>
<p>Otto, why don't you get some more gas. Here's the credit card.</p>
<p>And a mint for afterwards.</p>
<p>Five dollars a child? Last year it was free!</p>
<p>New ownership.</p>
<p>But we don't have that kind of money. In fact, no school could afford...</p>
<p>Here's the admission, plus something for you.</p>
<p>See that they get a little extra education.</p>
<p>Yes, sir, Principal Valiant!</p>
<p>He thinks he's so hot ever since he swept the Princi Awards.</p>
<p>Those things are rigged.</p>
<p>On May 21, 1864, the men of the 9th Bearded lnfantry... were sunning and fluffing their beards in the sun.</p>
<p>Suddenly, enemy troops crested that hill over there.</p>
<p>Fort Springfield, we surrender unconditionally!</p>
<p>We're sick! We need leeches... and hacksaws to saw off our gangrenous limbs.</p>
<p>But the Springfield brigade was too brave to accept their surrender.</p>
<p>Come on, boys. Those white flags are no match for our muskets!</p>
<p>Charge!</p>
<p>And the Springfielders heroically slaughtered their enemies... as they prayed for mercy.</p>
<p>It's hard to see what's going on. I can only make out the fat soldiers.</p>
<p>All right, children. Switch.</p>
<p>Hey, they're trying to learn for free!</p>
<p>Get them!</p>
<p>Use your phony g*n as clubs!</p>
<p>Run, children.</p>
<p>Start the bus, Otto! Start the bus!</p>
<p>Damn! I shouldn't have eaten the mint first.</p>
<p>Okay, hop on.</p>
<p>Wait! Wait!</p>
<p>Seymour, because of your penny-pinching... we're coming back from a field trip with the fewest children yet.</p>
<p>God bless the man who invented permission slips.</p>
<p>I think I got your lunch.</p>
<p>I didn't think this was for me.</p>
<p>Seymour, the teachers are fed up.</p>
<p>You have to put money back into the school.</p>
<p>You've cut back on everything.</p>
<p>Salaries, supplies, the food.</p>
<p>I don't care what you say, I can taste the newspaper.</p>
<p>Shredded newspapers add much-needed roughage and essential inks.</p>
<p>Besides, you didn't notice the old gym mats.</p>
<p>There's very little meat in these gym mats.</p>
<p>Our demands are very reasonable.</p>
<p>By ignoring them, you're selling out these children's futures.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, Edna! We both know these children have no future!</p>
<p>Prove me wrong, kids. Prove me wrong.</p>
<p>I've never seen them fight like that.</p>
<p>I'm worried that all this posturing could lead to a teachers' strike.</p>
<p>Strike, eh?</p>
<p>My bones are so brittle.</p>
<p>But I always drink plenty of &quot;malk&quot;?</p>
<p>How do you expect us to teach with these supplies?</p>
<p>This pointer's so old, it's worn down to a nub.</p>
<p>It still points, doesn't it?</p>
<p>Stop that! And look at this.</p>
<p>The only books we have are ones that were banned by other schools.</p>
<p>Well, the kids have to learn about Tek w*r sooner or later.</p>
<p>Go away, Bart. This is not a good time.</p>
<p>I saw you two fighting.</p>
<p>I'm worried there could be a strike and the school would shut down.</p>
<p>I'm sure you'd really hate that.</p>
<p>There's not going to be a strike, Bart.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Skinner said you wouldn't go through with it.</p>
<p>Skinner said that?</p>
<p>Well, I had to clean it up a little.</p>
<p>But basically, Krabappel said you'd give the teachers everything they want.</p>
<p>She did?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She said you'd fold faster than Superman on laundry day.</p>
<p>We'll see about that.</p>
<p>Simpson, I always thought you were sneaky and manipulative.</p>
<p>Now I see you're really a very sensitive little boy.</p>
<p>Thank you, sir.</p>
<p>You're being totally unfair, and the teachers won't stand for it!</p>
<p>Teachers! You don't have the guts to strike!</p>
<p>You don't have the guts to take us all on!</p>
<p>That's it!</p>
<p>Strike!</p>
<p>Attention, this is an emergency broadcast.</p>
<p>All is well in the school. My authority as principal is total...</p>
<p>Hey, give me that!</p>
<p>Attention, teachers. We're on strike!</p>
<p>Oh, no. Strike?</p>
<p>Miss Hoover, are you on...?</p>
<p>Go home, children.</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Mrs. Pommelhorst?</p>
<p>I'd like to get down now.</p>
<p>Hey, now that Largo's gone, we can play the forbidden music.</p>
<p>I heard that!</p>
<p>Bart? Lisa? What are you two doing home so early?</p>
<p>Great news, Mom!</p>
<p>Horrible news, Mom!</p>
<p>The school's on strike! Maybe forever.</p>
<p>Overload. Pleasure overload.</p>
<p>Luckily I've prepared for this, so I'm not too worried.</p>
<p>Sit up straight. Eyes forward. No talking.</p>
<p>Is that gum? Is that gum? Is that gum?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Bart, leave that crowbar here. You know I don't like you prying and jimmying.</p>
<p>Mom! Dad! Great news! The teachers are on...</p>
<p>We heard.</p>
<p>And we already hired a tutor.</p>
<p>Well, looks like we'll be staying late today... to make up for all this dilly-dallying.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>You, at the crane! Spin around real fast!</p>
<p>Now, you! Dump 3 tons of sand onto that Porta-Potty.</p>
<p>Hey! Can't you tell my voice from a 10-year-old kid's?</p>
<p>Ay caramba!</p>
<p>Hey, that little boy is playing three games at once.</p>
<p>Checkmate.</p>
<p>Checkmate.</p>
<p>Checkmate.</p>
<p>Dang.</p>
<p>Lousy teachers, trying to palm off our kids on us.</p>
<p>Dad, by striking, they're trying to change management... so they can be happier and more productive.</p>
<p>Lisa, if you don't like your job, you don't strike.</p>
<p>You just go in every day and do it really half-assed.</p>
<p>That's the American way.</p>
<p>I've got textbooks. But without state-approved syllabi... and standardized testing, my education can only go so far.</p>
<p>Honey, maybe you should relax a little.</p>
<p>Relax? I can't relax! Nor can I yield, relent or...</p>
<p>Only two synonyms?</p>
<p>Oh, my God! I'm losing my perspicacity!</p>
<p>Well, it's always in the last place you look.</p>
<p>If we were in school this week, what do you think we'd be learning?</p>
<p>Get away from me.</p>
<p>Good news, people!</p>
<p>I'm happy to announce another union has joined us in a sympathy strike!</p>
<p>The Piano Tuners Local 412!</p>
<p>Now for Operation Strike-Make-Go-Longer.</p>
<p>You know, I heard Skinner say the teachers will crack any minute.</p>
<p>Skinner said we'll crack, purple monkey dishwasher.</p>
<p>Well, we'll show him!</p>
<p>Especially for that &quot;purple monkey dishwasher&quot; remark.</p>
<p>Seymour, you are truly incompetent!</p>
<p>Well, I hardly think it's fair...</p>
<p>Dummy up, you!</p>
<p>Listen to those passing motorists who support the teachers.</p>
<p>Fifteen-minute recess, Milhouse.</p>
<p>The recess assignment is chapters three through seven.</p>
<p>Yay! Recess!</p>
<p>I found a hive of k*ll bees. You want to go throw rocks at it?</p>
<p>Sorry, Bart. I'm deeply immersed in the Teapot Dome scandal.</p>
<p>However, it might be feasible in a fortnight.</p>
<p>I can play in two weeks.</p>
<p>I just can't believe Stark would stoop to that... and right in the middle of Montana and Dakota's wedding.</p>
<p>All this free time. I never thought I'd get sick of Razor Fight II, The Slashening.</p>
<p>I probably should stop. My doctor says I have the wrists of an 80-year-old.</p>
<p>What do you mean, the bank is out of money? Insolvent?</p>
<p>You only have enough cash for the next three customers?</p>
<p>Just a second here. No, no. I don't have your money here.</p>
<p>It's in Bill's house, and Fred's house.</p>
<p>Hey, what the hell you doing with my money in your house, Fred?</p>
<p>Grade me! Look at me!</p>
<p>Evaluate and rank me!</p>
<p>I'm good, good, good and, oh, so smart!</p>
<p>Grade me!</p>
<p>I'm worried about the kids, Homie.</p>
<p>Lisa's becoming very obsessive.</p>
<p>This morning, I caught her trying to dissect her own raincoat.</p>
<p>I know. And this perpetual-motion machine she made today is a joke.</p>
<p>It just keeps going faster and faster.</p>
<p>And Bart isn't doing very well either.</p>
<p>He needs boundaries and structure.</p>
<p>There's something about flying a kite at night that's so unwholesome.</p>
<p>Hello, Mother dear.</p>
<p>That's it! We have to get them back to school.</p>
<p>I'm with you, Marge. Lisa, get in here.</p>
<p>In this house, we obey the laws of thermodynamics!</p>
<p>All right. I'd like to call this meeting of the PTA to or-diddly-order.</p>
<p>Let's see if we can't put an end to this strike fuss.</p>
<p>Mrs. Krabappel, why don't you begin.</p>
<p>Boo.</p>
<p>Oh, &quot;boo&quot; yourself! Our demands are simple.</p>
<p>A small cost-of-living increase and better equipment and supplies for your children.</p>
<p>Yeah, all right!</p>
<p><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content"><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle transcripts-topic-in-post" style="display:inline-block" data-full-width-responsive="true" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3808023418243141" data-ad-slot="1728561479"></ins>
<p><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div></p>
<p>Give it to them!</p>
<p>Yeah, in a dream world. We have a very tight budget.</p>
<p>To do what she's asking, we'd have to raise taxes.</p>
<p>Raise taxes?</p>
<p>They're too high as they are now.</p>
<p>I've had enough.</p>
<p>Taxes are bad.</p>
<p>It's your children's future.</p>
<p>Children's future.</p>
<p>Yes, children are important.</p>
<p>It'll cost you.</p>
<p>Oh, the taxes.</p>
<p>They're gonna raise taxes.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>All right, that's a good point.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, that sounds...</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, the taxes.</p>
<p>That means money.</p>
<p>The finger thing means the taxes.</p>
<p>I guess this is a case where we'll have to agree to disagree.</p>
<p>I don't agree to that.</p>
<p>Neither do I.</p>
<p>This is a dilly of a pickle.</p>
<p>Oh, my God! The PTA has disbanded!</p>
<p>No, no! The PTA has not disbanded.</p>
<p>We do have an emergency plan, in case of a prolonged strike, right here.</p>
<p>Let's see.</p>
<p>&quot;Replace teachers with superintelligent cyborgs.</p>
<p>Or, if cyborgs aren't invented yet, use people from the neighborhood.&quot;</p>
<p>Talking out of turn, that's a paddling.</p>
<p>Looking out the window, that's a paddling.</p>
<p>Staring at my sandals, that's a paddling.</p>
<p>Paddling the school canoe, you better believe that's a paddling.</p>
<p>All right, so the compression and expansion... of the longitudinal waves cause the erratic oscillation...</p>
<p>You can see it there.</p>
<p>Of the neighboring particles.</p>
<p>Yes? What is it? What? What is it?</p>
<p>Can I play with it?</p>
<p>No, you can't play with it.</p>
<p>You won't enjoy it on as many levels as I do.</p>
<p>The colors, children.</p>
<p>Okay, when I call your name, you say &quot;present&quot; or &quot;here.&quot;</p>
<p>No, say &quot;present.&quot;</p>
<p>Anita Bath.</p>
<p>All right. Settle down. Anita Bath here?</p>
<p>All right, fine. Fine.</p>
<p>Maya Buttreeks.</p>
<p>Hey, what are you laughing at? What?</p>
<p>Oh, I get it. I get it.</p>
<p>It's my big ears, isn't it, kids? Isn't it?</p>
<p>Well, children, I can't help that.</p>
<p>Wow, Bart! I'm impressed the way you knocked off all those substitutes.</p>
<p>In my weaker moments, I almost pity them.</p>
<p>Then I just remind myself, they're trying to teach.</p>
<p>I don't know what you did to all those substitutes, but it's going to stop now.</p>
<p>Leopold?</p>
<p>All right. You listen up, you little freaks! The fun stops here.</p>
<p>You're gonna shut your stinking traps and behave, damn it!</p>
<p>This is one substitute you're not gonna screw with!</p>
<p>Marge Simpson.</p>
<p>Hello, class. Hi, Bart.</p>
<p>Over here, sweetie. It's me, Mom.</p>
<p>Hi. Hey. Hello!</p>
<p>Well, I'm sure some of you already know me. I'm Bart Simpson's mother.</p>
<p>Mom.</p>
<p>Hey, Bart, what about the booby trap?</p>
<p>May I?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Mama's boy!</p>
<p>Teacher's pet! Teacher's pet!</p>
<p>I meant the other booby trap.</p>
<p>Kids have been doing that one since my day.</p>
<p>So how was everybody's day at school?</p>
<p>Horrifying.</p>
<p>Pointless.</p>
<p>Exhausting. It took the children 40 minutes to locate Canada on the map.</p>
<p>Marge, anyone can miss Canada, all tucked away down there.</p>
<p>My teacher's a nightmare. Three kids got sick from inhaling his ointment fumes.</p>
<p>He confiscated everything made of tin. And then he sent us home early... because he got his beard caught in the pencil sharpener.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>Okay. Let's see.</p>
<p>What if I did this?</p>
<p>You're on your own.</p>
<p>There's no way I'll get into an lvy League school now.</p>
<p>At this rate, I probably won't even get into Vassar.</p>
<p>I've had just about enough of your Vassar-bashing, young lady!</p>
<p>Look, Mom. It feels really weird having you on my turf.</p>
<p>How would you feel if I started mopping?</p>
<p>I'd be thrilled. You can start right now.</p>
<p>And I'm gonna keep teaching your class, like it or lump it.</p>
<p>Well, then. I guess I'll just have to get into the crawlspace again.</p>
<p>I hate it when he gets in there.</p>
<p>Over here.</p>
<p>Mom, I need a dollar.</p>
<p>Since you started teaching, kids have been taking my lunch money.</p>
<p>And I need that money for candy.</p>
<p>Here you go, precious. Now, go off with your friends.</p>
<p>&quot;Here you go, precious.&quot;</p>
<p>Why isn't my mom stopping this?</p>
<p>We've created a diversion.</p>
<p>That's a very nice jig, Kearney.</p>
<p>Now, isn't dancing much more fun than bullying?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That's it. I can't take this anymore, Milhouse.</p>
<p>I've got to get the real teachers back.</p>
<p>Bart, you'll never get Krabappel and Skinner together again.</p>
<p>They're like two positively charged ions.</p>
<p>Wait, that's it.</p>
<p>With your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts... we can figure out a plan to get them back together.</p>
<p>A surprise party for me in Principal Skinner's office?</p>
<p>Well, I don't know, but all right.</p>
<p>Me? Go to my office?</p>
<p>It's highly irregular, but all right.</p>
<p>You're not coming out until you reach an agreement.</p>
<p>Let us out, Bart!</p>
<p>This is not funny, Bart.</p>
<p>I mean it.</p>
<p>Stop it, Bart! Let us out right now!</p>
<p>Don't worry. They'll start negotiating.</p>
<p>Bart, open this door!</p>
<p>Let us out!</p>
<p>For the love of God, let us out!</p>
<p>Come on! You are gonna be so sorry.</p>
<p>Let us out right now!</p>
<p>You're gonna be very, very sorry!</p>
<p>Help! Well... Seymour, I guess we could start talking.</p>
<p>What's the point? There's no more money... unless you've got some magic new source of revenue.</p>
<p>We've got to figure it out. We're locked in here like prisoners.</p>
<p>Prisoners in our own school.</p>
<p>This was a great way to make extra money... renting out our cloakrooms to the overcrowded prison system.</p>
<p>Yo. I used to sit right over there.</p>
<p>It's all right, children. Just ignore the m*rder.</p>
<p>And as a bonus, some of our more troublesome students... might be scared straight.</p>
<p>Kid, help me break out of here.</p>
<p>I'll totally make it worth your while.</p>
<p>I'm listening.</p>
