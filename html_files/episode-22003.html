							<p><em>The Simpsons</em></p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p><em>May I offer my condolences on the untimely passing...</em> of your Great-aunt Hortense.</p>
<p>As her only living heirs, you stand to inherit her entire estate.</p>
<p>Poor Aunt Hortense.</p>
<p>Whoo-hoo. Whoo-hoo.</p>
<p>The only stipulation is that you spend one night... in a haunted house.</p>
<p>Oh. Isn't that somewhat unusual?</p>
<p>No. It's a standard clause.</p>
<p>Well, luckily, there's no such thing as ghosts.</p>
<p>Yes, there's no such thing as ghosts.</p>
<p>Best night's sleep I ever had.</p>
<p>Their tap water tasted better than ours.</p>
<p>Here you go- $100 each.</p>
<p>The rest goes to Ann Landers... as was stipulated in your aunt's will.</p>
<p><em>Oh, I'm sorry.</em></p>
<p>I must have continued talking after you left the office.</p>
<p>I do that sometimes.</p>
<p><em>Oh, my.</em></p>
<p>What are you gonna spend your money on, kids?</p>
<p>There's a special on tacos down at the Taco Mat- hundred tacos for $100- I'm gonna get that.</p>
<p>I'm gonna contribute my money to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.</p>
<p>Tacos? Public broadcasting?</p>
<p>I won't have you kids throwing away your money like that.</p>
<p>You're both coming downtown with me, and you're gonna put that money in the bank.</p>
<p>Boy, I sure could go for 100 tacos right about now.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><em>Yes, this should provide adequate sustenance for the Doctor Who marathon.</p>
<p>You'll feel better knowing your money's...</em> in the hands of professionals.</p>
<p>&quot;Ook, ook.&quot;</p>
<p>Are you folks ready to go ape?</p>
<p>Mom?</p>
<p>A professional in an ape mask is still a professional.</p>
<p>And you'll find that saving for your future... is far more thrilling than any roller coaster.</p>
<p>Really? Wow! I should have started a long time ago.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Now fill out these forms.</p>
<p>I'm sure you'll find them more exciting than a weekend with Batman.</p>
<p>I got their new Thrifty Saver savings account.</p>
<p>2.3% annual interest instead of the normal 2.25.</p>
<p>So a year from now I'll have an extra nickel.</p>
<p>I got the account where you get free customized checks.</p>
<p><em>I chose the Hindenburg flip-book series. Cool!</em></p>
<p>Hmm. Checking accounts aren't really for children, Bart.</p>
<p>No, Mom, I can handle it.</p>
<p>Let's see. Pay to the order of... Lisa-</p>
<p>One cent, and no cents.</p>
<p>And now the old John Hancock.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><em>A million dollars?</em></p>
<p>Thanks, Bart. I owe you one.</p>
<p>That's a post-dated check, remember.</p>
<p>Don't cash it till the year 10,000.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>As soon as the check clears, I'll let you go.</p>
<p>That's it. No more autographs. I gotta go.</p>
<p>They're naming a new sandwich after me at my restaurant.</p>
<p>It's okay, Bart. You can share mine.</p>
<p>Quick! Press against me while the ink's still wet.</p>
<p>No need. I'm going to get Krusty's autograph the easy way.</p>
<p>If he wants these 25 cents, he'll have to endorse the check by signing it on the back.</p>
<p>Then, when my monthly bank statement comes...</p>
<p>I'll get the check back, complete with autograph.</p>
<p>No fuss, no muss.</p>
<p>That's a good plan... but it won't impress girls like this.</p>
<p>Ew!</p>
<p>Lisa's autograph. Apu's autograph.</p>
<p>Oh, what do you know. Jimbo's real name is Corky.</p>
<p>And... Krusty.</p>
<p>Hey! &quot;Cayman lslands Offshore Holding Corporation&quot;?</p>
<p>Krusty was supposed to sign this.</p>
<p>Take it back and make him sign it.</p>
<p>Uh, no, no.</p>
<p>Stamping the back of a check is perfectly legal, little boy.</p>
<p>Many people do it to save time.</p>
<p>You see, in this case, instead of writing out his name...</p>
<p>Krusty has stamped the name of his Cayman lslands Holding Corporation on the-</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Uh, excuse me a minute.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I can't divulge information about that customer's secret, illegal account.</p>
<p>Oh, crap. I shouldn't have said he was a customer.</p>
<p>Oh, crap! I shouldn't have said it was a secret.</p>
<p>Oh, crap! I certainly shouldn't have said it was illegal.</p>
<p>It's too hot today.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! I bought this popcorn fair and square.</p>
<p>Sorry. The bank is-</p>
<p>Oh, kid, gosh. I meant to tell you-</p>
<p>Turns out that Krusty is one of the biggest tax cheats in history.</p>
<p>And they nailed him, all thanks to you.</p>
<p>Some might say you're a hero, kid.</p>
<p>Not me, however. I love Krusty.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, Krusty the Clown... was arrested today for massive tax fraud.</p>
<p>Krusty's years of tax &quot;avoision&quot; would never have-</p>
<p>What the heck is &quot;avoision&quot;?</p>
<p>&quot;Avoision&quot;- It's a crime.</p>
<p>Look it up. Would never have-</p>
<p>&quot;Evasion. &quot; &quot;Evasion.&quot;</p>
<p>I don't say &quot;evasion,&quot; I say &quot;avoision.&quot;</p>
<p>Would never have come to light if not... for a crafty little boy named Bart Simpson.</p>
<p>Krusty's my hero. How could I do this to him?</p>
<p>It is a tragedy for all us kids... but Bart, you can't b*at yourself up.</p>
<p>Yeah. There'll be enough people to do that for me at recess tomorrow.</p>
<p>Oh, I can't go to jail!</p>
<p>I got a swanky lifestyle. I'm used to the best.</p>
<p>Krusty, this is America. We don't send our celebrities to jail.</p>
<p>We're just going to garnish your salary.</p>
<p>Garnish my celery?</p>
<p>Please, Krusty. No jokes.</p>
<p>Who's joking?</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know what you're saying.</p>
<p>It all sounds so crazy to me.</p>
<p>It simply means we'll be taking part of your salary... until your debt is repaid.</p>
<p>Say, 75% for 40 years.</p>
<p>But I don't plan to live that long.</p>
<p>Oh, better make it 95%.</p>
<p>Oy.</p>
<p>The lnternal Revenue Service presents...</p>
<p><em>Herschel Krustofski's Clown-Related...</p>
<p>Entertainment Show.</em></p>
<p>Hey, hey, kids.</p>
<p>Now that the Feds are calling the shots... this show's gotta be a lot more cost-effective.</p>
<p>So we had to cut down on the frills... like sets, props, costumes and Sideshow Mel.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean we can't have fun.</p>
<p>For example, I sure wish somebody would give me a banana cream pie. Yeah!</p>
<p>Uh-</p>
<p>I guess we can't afford pies right now.</p>
<p>Well, throw something!</p>
<p>Oh, that corner!</p>
<p>Um, I'll have four Tax Burgers... one &quot;I.R.S. -wich&quot;- withhold the lettuce- three dependent-size sodas... and a &quot;FICA-ccino.&quot;</p>
<p>Fill out schedule &quot;B.&quot; You should receive your burgers in six to eight weeks.</p>
<p>Well, let's see here.</p>
<p>Add schedule &quot;B&quot; to line 53, take away the-</p>
<p>Hey, Marge, what were your gambling losses last year?</p>
<p><em>Seven hundred dollars.</em></p>
<p>They took my money, they wrecked my show... they buried a bunch of stinking veterans in my family plot... but at least I still got my memories.</p>
<p>Those are locked up safe in my fabulous mansion.</p>
<p>And now, lot number 66, a handmade leather suitcase... carried by the Krustofski family... upon their arrival at Ellis Island in 1902.</p>
<p>A priceless heirloom and historic piece of&quot;Krustyana.&quot;</p>
<p>What am I bid?</p>
<p>Forty cents.</p>
<p>I got 40 cents.</p>
<p>Sold, for 40 cents.</p>
<p>Forty cents?</p>
<p>My grandpa Zev would turn over in his grave... if it wasn't filled with some veteran.</p>
<p>Lot 67, 32 cartons of pornography.</p>
<p>Ten cents.</p>
<p>Twelve.</p>
<p>Twelve cents to our phone bidder in Japan. Any other bids?</p>
<p>All I brought is a dime. I didn't know there'd be pornography.</p>
<p>Sold, for 12 cents.</p>
<p>Oh, my beloved pornography.</p>
<p>I can't watch this anymore.</p>
<p>I'm going to bed.</p>
<p>How much for Krusty's bed?</p>
<p>Half a buck.</p>
<p>Sold!</p>
<p>Good night, everybody.</p>
<p>Good night, Moe.</p>
<p>And now lot number 2,380- Krusty's private plane...</p>
<p><em>the I'm-On-A-Rolla Gay.</p>
<p>But I love that plane.</em></p>
<p>I used to fly to Vegas in it with Dean Martin.</p>
<p>One night he looked out the window... and the moon hit his eye like a big pizza pie.</p>
<p>We wrote a song about it... but it ended up infringing on one he recorded years before.</p>
<p>Hey, Selma, that plane would go great with your new suitcase.</p>
<p>Nah, I just bought it to soak my feet in.</p>
<p>Krusty? Hi. Is it okay if I sit down here?</p>
<p>Aah. Go ahead, kid. Knock yourself out.</p>
<p>I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you, Krusty... but you know, my mom says...</p>
<p>God never closes a door without opening a window.</p>
<p>No offense, kid, but your mom's a dingbat.</p>
<p>There's no silver lining here.</p>
<p>I was a big cheese- a huge cheese!</p>
<p>But now look at me.</p>
<p>I gotta ride the bus like a schnook.</p>
<p>I gotta live in an apartment like an idiot.</p>
<p>I gotta wait in line with nobodies... to buy groceries from a failure!</p>
<p>It doesn't matter how you live or what you did wrong.</p>
<p>As long as you're on TV, people will respect you.</p>
<p>Respect? Pah!</p>
<p>What good is respect without the moola to back it up?</p>
<p>Everywhere I go I see teachers in Ferraris- research scientists drinking champagne.</p>
<p>I tried to drink a Coke on the bus...</p>
<p><em>and they took away my pass.</em></p>
<p>That's no life for a famous clown.</p>
<p>Well, if it'll make you feel any better, Krusty... you can punch me in the face.</p>
<p>Nah, forget it. Go home, kid.</p>
<p><em>Shiva H. Vishnu!</p>
<p>Where is that noise coming from?</em></p>
<p>I must say, I've had a lovely evening, Agnes.</p>
<p><em>I don't suppose I could come in for a cup of-</em></p>
<p>Seymour!</p>
<p>Mother. Superintendent Chalmers!</p>
<p>Skinner!</p>
<p>What I wouldn't give for something... to interrupt this awkward moment.</p>
<p>That'll do nicely.</p>
<p>You gotta hand it to Krusty.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Even with all his problems, he's still willing... to do something unbelievably dangerous... just to entertain his fans.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Oh, that's my Krusty. I got a feeling he'll be all right.</p>
<p>Oh, my God! Krusty's shoes!</p>
<p>Okay, folks, show's over. Nothing to see here.</p>
<p>Show's- Oh, my God!</p>
<p>A horrible plane crash!</p>
<p>Hey, everybody, get a load of this flaming wreckage.</p>
<p>Come on, crowd around. Crowd around. Don't be shy. Crowd around.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen...</p>
<p>Krusty the Clown is dead.</p>
<p>I can't believe Krusty's really gone.</p>
<p>Don't worry, son.</p>
<p>I'm sure he's up in heaven right now... laughing it up with all the other celebrities-</p>
<p>John Dillinger, Ty Cobb, Joseph Stalin.</p>
<p>I wish I were dead.</p>

<p>We're gathered to mourn the passing... of Herschel Schmoeckel Krustofski... beloved entertainer and dear friend.</p>
<p>Hello. I'm Troy McClure.</p>
<p>You might remember me from such show business funerals... as &quot;Andre the Giant, We Hardly Knew Ye&quot;... and &quot;Shemp Howard: Today We Mourn a Stooge.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, Krusty's closest friend and sidekick...</p>
<p>Sideshow Mel.</p>
<p>I'll miss you, Krusty-</p>
<p>I and all the other Sideshows-</p>
<p><em>except Sideshow Bob.</p>
<p>But, in the midst of our sorrow...</em> we can take comfort in the fact that your elevated blood-alcohol level... probably helped you burn up quicker.</p>
<p>Since you left us no earthly remains... it is my sad duty to unveil this simple memorial.</p>
<p>Next in our cavalcade of celebrity mourners- Bob Newhart.</p>
<p>Uh- See, uh-</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, I'm, uh-</p>
<p>I was just- I'm just k*ll time here.</p>
<p>I was waiting for a... well, a different- different funeral to start.</p>
<p>I'll handle it. Bob Newhart, everybody!</p>
<p>Oh, uh-</p>
<p>Although, you know- Though I started my career... several years before Krusty, so... you know, I could never really have learned anything... directly from him... still, I think, in a way- in a very meaningful way- that, uh- that I- uh- uh- all of us- have, uh- have learned from him.</p>
<p>You know, that is, by being, uh, on television for- for- for so many years.</p>
<p>Even- Even though... you know, m-many of us, we- we didn't- we didn't watch his show.</p>
<p>Th-Thank you.</p>
<p>Well, that's the funeral, folks.</p>
<p>We'll be sitting shivah at the Friar's Club at 7:00 p. m., and again at 10:00.</p>
<p>You must be over 18 for the 10:00. It gets a little blue.</p>
<p>And so, Herschel Krustofski... is gone, but not forgotten.</p>
<p>Today was the unveiling of the new Krusty stamp.</p>
<p>Postal patrons were asked to choose between two competing designs- one of Krusty's heartwarming smile... and one of his fiery death.</p>
<p>By a nearly two-to-one vote, the smiling Krusty was chosen.</p>
<p>Don't let Krusty's death get you down, boy.</p>
<p>People die all the time... just like that.</p>
<p>Why, you could wake up dead tomorrow.</p>
<p>Well, good night.</p>
<p>Krusty!</p>
<p>Mom! I just saw Krusty!</p>
<p>Yes, dear, in your mind.</p>
<p>No, on the street.</p>
<p>On the street in your mind.</p>
<p>Why won't you believe me?</p>
<p>Sweetheart, maybe you just want Krusty to be alive so badly... you think you see him everywhere.</p>
<p>I went through the same thing when Lyndon Johnson died.</p>
<p><em>And these pills will help with the queasiness.</em></p>
<p>Krusty? Dr. Hibbert, who was that man?</p>
<p>Now, Bart, telling you... would violate the patient-doctor privilege... just as if I were to tell you that Jasper here has five seconds to live.</p>
<p>What'd he say?</p>
<p>He said I'm next.</p>
<p>Am I going crazy? I'm seeing Krusty everywhere.</p>
<p>Bart, you're seeing Krusty everywhere... because you want to tell him you're sorry for causing his death.</p>
<p>Would it help if I told you you're not responsible... for Krusty's death?</p>
<p>Yes. Yes, it would.</p>
<p>Well, I can't. You'll just have to learn to live with your mental problem.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. All those things I saw- there's a connection.</p>
<p>The truck full of nets and buckets... the queasy guy, the lobsters-</p>
<p>They all point to one thing. Follow me.</p>
<p>Arr! I've got some customers.</p>
<p>Call me back, Ishmael.</p>
<p>Ahoy there, minnows.</p>
<p>Ahoy. Have you seen this man?</p>
<p>Arr! That's Handsome Pete. He dances for nickels.</p>
<p>Pete, ye got some customers.</p>
<p>No, we're looking for this man- Krusty the Clown.</p>
<p>Hmm. N'arr, n'arr, n'arr.</p>
<p>It's hopeless, Bart. We've searched up and down these docks... from pier one to that Pier I by pier 17.</p>
<p><em>Lisa, look-a signature with stars around it, just like Krusty's.</em></p>
<p>&quot;Rory B. Bellows, slip eight.&quot; Let's go!</p>
<p>Not a quarter! Arr! He'll be dancing for hours.</p>
<p>Are you Rory B. Bellows?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>How about Krusty the Clown?</p>
<p>Sorry. I don't do impressions.</p>
<p>Well, if you're not Krusty, how come you have the exact same signature as him?</p>
<p>I'm Rory Bellows, I tell you... and I got a lot of corroborating evidence... over here... by the throttle!</p>
<p>You know, you two could have said something... instead of letting me make an ass of myself.</p>
<p>Hey, you got a pacemaker scar, just like Krusty.</p>
<p>And Krusty's superfluous third nipple.</p>
<p>Can't you see I don't want to be Krusty anymore?</p>
<p>That's why I faked my death.</p>
<p>But we saw your plane crash.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I wasn't in it.</p>
<p><em>Just before I hit the mountain, I jumped out of the plane... into a carefully placed net.</em></p>
<p>Now that we've blown your cover, I guess you gotta come back and do your show again.</p>
<p>Or k*ll us.</p>
<p>I won't be coming back, kids.</p>
<p>I got a sweet life here.</p>
<p>The sea air is clearing my lungs... the sun is toasting my pale skin a healthy brown... and most important, I learned that I don't need money to be happy.</p>
<p><em>All that high living just distracted me...</em> from my true calling in life- salvaging sunken barges... for scrap iron.</p>
<p>Sorry, kids. There's nothing left for me on dry land anymore.</p>
<p>But Krusty, what about all the kids who depend on you... to brighten up their afternoons?</p>
<p><em>Are you gonna turn your back on them?</p>
<p>Yes!</em></p>
<p>Come on, Lise. Krusty doesn't want our attention anymore.</p>
<p>Let's go worship somebody who has the guts to be a celebrity.</p>
<p>Yeah. Krusty doesn't want to be a clown.</p>
<p>He's happy just being another blue-collar bozo.</p>
<p>Meh!</p>
<p>Krusty's tired of having phonies around... pretending to be his friends.</p>
<p>I'm sure he'll find plenty of people who'll like him for who he is.</p>
<p>Uh, it could happen.</p>
<p>Aw, who needs friends?</p>
<p>The incessant beep of the global positioning system... is all the companionship I need.</p>
<p>Tell me where you are now, you bastard!</p>
<p>All right, I admit it. I miss the phonies.</p>
<p>That's all I miss- that and Shirley Jones's and Marty lngels's New Year's Eve party.</p>
<p>What about that great feeling you get from knowing you're better than regular people?</p>
<p>What about being an illiterate TV clown... who's still more respected than all the scientists... doctors and educators in the country put together?</p>
<p>Yeah! I'm not gonna let those guys hog all the respect... while I'm out here on some stinkin' tub.</p>
<p>That's just what those eggheads want.</p>
<p>Well, forget it, poindexter, 'cause Krusty's back in town!</p>
<p>Yea!</p>
<p>So, Krusty, what are you gonna do about your tax problem?</p>
<p>Don't sweat it.</p>
<p>The life of Rory B. Bellows is insured... for a surprisingly large amount.</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
