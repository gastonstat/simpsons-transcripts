<p>D'oh!</p>
<p><em>Ay.!: Qué agonía.!</em></p>
<p>Oh, he wants that corn so much.</p>
<p><em>Ay.!: Dios no me ama.!</em></p>
<p>I want to see what's on the other broadcasts.</p>
<p>Where's the oscillator on this thing?</p>
<p>No, Grampa! Don't!</p>
<p>Dad, sit down!</p>
<p>Gosh darn it!</p>
<p>What does this do?</p>
<p>Oh, I'll make my adjustments here and-</p>
<p>Yea! We're getting a new TV!</p>
<p>Let's go to the Sharper lmage. They've got a TV shaped like a '50s diner!</p>
<p>No! Let's go to The Nature Company.</p>
<p>They've got a TV assembled by Hopi lndians.</p>
<p>We can't afford to shop at any store that has a philosophy. We just need a TV.</p>
<p>We're going to go to the outlet mall in Ogdenville.</p>
<p>Look at these low, low prices on famous brand-name electronics!</p>
<p>Don't be a sap, Dad. These are just crappy knock-offs.</p>
<p>I know a genuine Panaphonics when I see it.</p>
<p>And look, there's Magnetbox and Sorny.</p>
<p>I'm not going to lie to you. Those are all superior machines.</p>
<p>But if you like to watch your TV, and I mean really watch it... you want the Carnivalé.</p>
<p>It features two-pronged wall plug, pre-molded hand-grip well... durable outer casing to prevent fall-apart.</p>
<p>Sold! You wrap it up, I'll start bringing in the pennies.</p>
<p>Honey, I don't think these clothes are us.</p>
<p>Who are they?</p>
<p>Hey, Brandine! You could wear this shirt to work.</p>
<p>Oh, Cletis, you know I gotta wear the shirt what Dairy Queen give me.</p>
<p><em>Hey, Mom.! There's something in here.!</em></p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p>Oh, it's beautiful.</p>
<p>Can it be a real Chanel?</p>
<p>It is!</p>
<p>Ninety dollars?</p>
<p>But it's marked down from 2,800.</p>
<p>Oh, you look so sophisticated.</p>
<p>Just like Mary Hart.</p>
<p>It fits like a dream too.</p>
<p>But we can't afford $90, even if it is a bargain.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be right to buy something just for me.</p>
<p>If it were a suit we could all wear, maybe then-</p>
<p>Come on, Mom! You never treat yourself to anything.</p>
<p>Oh, sure I do. I treated myself to a Sanka not three days ago.</p>
<p>But this is a real find.</p>
<p>Just buy it. You don't have to rationalize everything.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p><em>All right, I will buy it!</em></p>
<p>It'll be good for the economy.</p>
<p>You look great!</p>
<p>Really? You like it?</p>
<p>Oh, I'd love to wear this someplace special.</p>
<p>Sperlock's Cafeteria it is.</p>
<p>What about the symphony or the theater?</p>
<p>Oh-</p>
<p>What's the point of going out? We're just gonna wind up back here anyway.</p>
<p>Oh, Mrs. Simpson, you are looking very prosperous today.</p>
<p>Might I interest you in some of our impulse items here by the cash register?</p>
<p>Perhaps a crazy motorized wiggle pen?</p>
<p>Look at the craziness.</p>
<p>Attendant, I'd like some gas.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I do not speak English. Okay.</p>
<p>But you were just talking to-</p>
<p>Yes, yes. Hot dog, hot dog. Yes, sir. No, sir. Maybe. Okay.</p>
<p>Well, I can't pump it myself. I'm calling Triple &quot;A.&quot;</p>
<p>I used to be a little overwhelmed too. But it's not that hard.</p>
<p>I can show you.</p>
<p>Marge, is that you?</p>
<p>Marge Bouvier from high school?</p>
<p>Um, yeah. Hi. Hi, Evelyn.</p>
<p>How about that? Marge, you look wonderful!</p>
<p><em>And to think I heard you married Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>I did marry Homer.</em></p>
<p>Come. You must show me the pumps.</p>
<p>Ninety percent of the time if the gas isn't pumping, this is your problem.</p>
<p><em>Automotive k*ll and fashion sense.</em></p>
<p>Well, you've come a long way from the girl I knew nothing about in high school.</p>
<p>We ran with different crowds.</p>
<p>You had your debutante balls and skinny-dipping... and I had my... home shoe-repair course.</p>
<p>Oh, Marge, you haven't changed a bit as far as I know.</p>
<p>Say, why don't you drop by the country club tomorrow?</p>
<p>Oh, and bring the family!</p>
<p>You there. Fill it up with petroleum distillate.</p>
<p>And revulcanize my tires, posthaste.</p>
<p>Bart, comb your hair!</p>
<p>Homer, I don't think you should wear a short-sleeved shirt with a tie.</p>
<p>Oh, but Sipowicz does it.</p>
<p>If Detective Sipowicz jumped off a cliff, would you do that too?</p>
<p>Oh, I wish I was Sipowicz.</p>
<p>Do I have to go?</p>
<p>That country club is a hotbed of exclusionist snobs and status-seeking social climbers.</p>
<p>I've told you, I don't like you using the word &quot;hotbed.&quot;</p>
<p>Please, Lisa. We so rarely get to do things like this.</p>
<p>And, everybody, everybody please be on your best behavior.</p>
<p>Bart, no grifting.</p>
<p>Aw, raspberries.</p>
<p>Name, please?</p>
<p>Simpson family.</p>
<p>We're not poor.</p>
<p>Well, we're not.</p>
<p>Go on in. They're expecting you at the clubhouse.</p>
<p>Look at this!</p>
<p>Livin' large!</p>
<p>Oh, my!</p>
<p><em>I've always dreamed of coming here.</p>
<p>Everybody keep smiling, and I know we're going to fit right in.</p>
<p>Marge, you made it.! And you wore that lovely suit.</p>
<p>Karyn, Gillian, Eliza-beth...</p>
<p>Patri-cia, Robert-a, Su-san, meet Marge.</em></p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>How are you doing?</p>
<p>Pleased to meet you.</p>
<p>You look like such a happy bunch... of people.</p>
<p>That's the trouble with first impressions- you only get to make one.</p>
<p>Th-That reminds me of a funny apron I saw-</p>
<p>You know, Marge, your family doesn't have to stand in the alcove.</p>
<p><em>They're free to enjoy the club.</em></p>
<p>Uh, come on, kids. Let's go sit in the car till your mom's done fitting in.</p>
<p>Eliza-beth is right.</p>
<p>Why shout yourself hoarse at incompetent sales clerks... when you can get nearly everything mail-order?</p>
<p>I won't eat anything unless it's shipped overnight from Vermont or Washington state.</p>
<p><em>We order our steaks through The New Yorker.</em></p>
<p>I have a sneaking suspicion that L.L. Bean and Eddie Bauer are selling me the same honey.</p>
<p><em>I get food through the mail, but in a different way.</p>
<p>Every month, Good Housekeeping arrives in my mailbox bursting with recipes.</p>
<p>Sometimes the most satisfying meal is the one you cook yourself.</em></p>
<p>Hmm. That's very true, Marge.</p>
<p>One night, Wiff and I came home late, and we decided not to wake lris.</p>
<p>Instead, we microwaved our own soup!</p>
<p>Of course it was a horrible mess.</p>
<p>But lris didn't mind cleaning it up.</p>
<p><em>Didn't everybody have a wonderful time?</em></p>
<p>I thought it was so opulent.</p>
<p>Like the Playboy Mansion, but non-sexual.</p>
<p>That place is weird.</p>
<p>A man in the bathroom kept handing me towels till I paid him to stop.</p>
<p>Shoulda held out longer, boy.</p>
<p>The rich are different from you and me.</p>
<p>Yes! They're better!</p>
<p>Socially better. And if we fit in, we can be better too.</p>
<p>So today, while the rest of you were out being different, I did a very good job of fitting in.</p>
<p>So good that Evelyn gave us a guest pass. They might even ask us to join.</p>
<p>Boy, Marge!</p>
<p>You must've really done a number on those rich suckers.</p>
<p>Don't thank me. Thank my beautiful new suit.</p>
<p>Fritz, you idiot!</p>
<p>I didn't order a baloney sandwich!</p>
<p>I ordered an abalone sandwich!</p>
<p>I don't know what Mom's thinking.</p>
<p>This whole country club scene is so decadent.</p>
<p>All these spoiled... brats... and their... smug... complacent parents.</p>
<p>It just reinforces the unspoken class system... of... horses... sitting on their high... horses-</p>
<p>I'm sorry! I gotta go!</p>
<p>Oh, we've got a winning hand!</p>
<p>We can take the rest of the tricks.</p>
<p>Oh, you'd better be careful. The purpose of this game is to make friends.</p>
<p>You don't make friends by winning.</p>
<p>Still, there's nothing more popular than a gracious winner.</p>
<p>Don't ask me. I'm just hair.</p>
<p>Your head stopped 18 inches ago.</p>
<p>Queen of hearts.</p>
<p>I believe all the rest are ours.</p>
<p>Oh, well played.</p>
<p>We could've stopped them if you had changed to a different suit.</p>
<p>I thought perhaps changing suits had gone out of fashion. Eh, Marge?</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Ho-ho-ho! Hoo-hoo! Ohh!</p>
<p>Hmm!</p>
<p>You know, Homer, the traditional way to cheat in golf...</p>
<p><em>is to lower your score.</em></p>
<p>That's one way.</p>
<p>I'm P.G.A. Tour Pro Tom Kite.</p>
<p>How about I give you a few pointers on your game?</p>
<p>Now, you don't want to overthink.</p>
<p>Not an issue.</p>
<p>Keep your head down.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Pretend there's no one else here.</p>
<p><em>And just go at your own pace.</em></p>
<p>Wow! Very impressive.</p>
<p>You're a natural, Mr. Simpson.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Uh-huh. All you need is your own set of clubs.</p>
<p>And stay the hell out of my locker!</p>
<p>You can keep the shoes.</p>
<p>Marge, did you know that Kennedy and Lincoln had the same handicap?</p>
<p>Homer, please. I have to alter this suit so it looks different for tomorrow.</p>
<p>Just slap some bumper stickers on it and come to bed, will you, Marge?</p>
<p>Love your outfit, Marge.</p>
<p>The vest says, &quot;Let's have lunch,&quot; but the culottes say, &quot;You're paying.&quot;</p>
<p>Why, thank you, Robert-A!</p>
<p><em>Mom, look.! I found something more fun than complaining.!</p>
<p>Marge, your family is fitting in perfectly here.</em></p>
<p>If all goes well at Saturday's ball...</p>
<p>I'd love to sponsor you for membership.</p>
<p>Oh, that would be a dream come true!</p>
<p>I'll be there with bells on.</p>
<p><em>Bells?</em></p>
<p>Where exactly will you be attaching them to that mangled Chanel suit?</p>
<p>Oh, don't worry, Marge.</p>
<p>Her idea of wit is nothing more than an incisive observation... humorously phrased and delivered with impeccable timing.</p>
<p>I'm sure you'll be a smash at the ball, and I just know you'll have a lovely new outfit.</p>
<p>That's some fine chipping, Homer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can you bank it into the handicapped stall?</p>
<p>Seat down.</p>
<p>Hmm. Who is that lavatory linksman, Smithers?</p>
<p>Homer Simpson, sir. One of the fork-and-spoon operators from Sector 7G.</p>
<p>Well, he's certainly got a loose waggle.</p>
<p>Perhaps I've finally found a golfer worthy of a match with Monty Burns, eh?</p>
<p>Oh, his waggle is no match for yours, sir. I've never seen you lose a game.</p>
<p>Except for that one in '74 when you let Richard Nixon win. That was very kind of you, sir.</p>
<p>Oh, he just looked so forlorn, Smithers, with his...</p>
<p>&quot;I can't go to prison, Monty. They'll eat me alive!&quot;</p>
<p>Say, I wonder if this Homer Nixon is any relation?</p>
<p>Unlikely, sir. They-They spell and pronounce their name differently.</p>
<p>Bah! Schedule a game and I'll ask him myself.</p>
<p>This game could mean big things for me, Marge.</p>
<p>If I b*at Mr. Burns, I mean, really wallop him bad...</p>
<p>I'm sure to get that big raise I've been g*n for.</p>
<p>All right, but if you win, don't make a scene and dance around with your &quot;whoo-hoo's.&quot;</p>
<p>Please! We can't afford a single slip-up. They're judging us.</p>
<p>Mwah. Mwah!</p>
<p>Mom, did you like horses when you were my age? 'Cause I heard-</p>
<p>I don't know. Lisa, tonight is very important.</p>
<p>Mommy has to alter her suit so it looks like a totally new one.</p>
<p>Mom, do you want to know the 15 reasons I like horses better than cars? One-</p>
<p>I really need to concentrate on this. Would you mind just-</p>
<p>You know how a horse goes like this?</p>
<p>Mom!</p>
<p>I've altered this so many times, it's nearly impossible to-</p>
<p>Whee! Whee! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!</p>
<p>Lisa, please!</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No, no, no, no!</p>

<p><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div></p>
<p>At times like this I guess all you can do is laugh.</p>
<p><em>I need a formal dress for tonight!</em></p>
<p>You've come to the right place.</p>
<p>We've got classy duds up the ying-yang.</p>
<p>I call this one &quot;Fantasy in Maroon.&quot;</p>
<p>It's got some cigarette burns, but we can patch them up with Nu Vinyl.</p>
<p>It's a bit peppery for me.</p>
<p>Why don't we put this in the &quot;maybe&quot; pile?</p>
<p>This was originally a Halloween costume... but it found its way into my regular rotation.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Good morning, Mr. Burns.</p>
<p>Beautiful day to be outside, isn't it?</p>
<p>Rant on, Simpson, but your vainglorious boasting... will only add savor to my inevitable triumph.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Yes. You're in deep &quot;d'oh&quot; now.</p>
<p>Perfect as always, sir. Right on the green.</p>
<p>Oh, quit cogitating, Steinmetz, and use an open-faced club- the sand wedge!</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Open-faced club sand wedge.</p>
<p>You're four strokes behind, Simpson.</p>
<p>Oh, a cunning stratagem, sir.</p>
<p>It's curving right toward the green.</p>
<p>And it's... there!</p>
<p>He got to the green in one sh*t?</p>
<p>How can that old man... hit so far?</p>
<p>Now, keep your head down.</p>
<p>Ignore all distractions.</p>
<p>Miss! Miss?</p>
<p>Do you have a Chanel suit, or any other high-quality clothes?</p>
<p>No, but we do have a shipment of slightly burnt Sears activewear coming in this afternoon.</p>
<p>Oh, I give up.</p>
<p>What time, and how burnt?</p>
<p>Cripes, man! Can't you ever get to the green in less than two shots?</p>
<p>Smithers, what are you doing up here?</p>
<p>What are you doing with his ball?</p>
<p>And all those other balls?</p>
<p>Uh, there are no other balls.</p>
<p>Just these, uh, reptile eggs! Oh, step away! They're endangered.</p>
<p>These aren't reptile eggs.</p>
<p>You've been cheating!</p>
<p>No matter where Mr. Burns hits the ball, you put a fresh one on the green!</p>
<p>Cheating? For me?</p>
<p>Good lord, Smithers! That's patently unnecessary.</p>
<p>I'm one of the world's finest golfers.</p>
<p>In all of the years you've caddied for me, I've never lost a-</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>So you're not the best golfer here.</p>
<p>Wait till I tell everyone about this.</p>
<p>You stink.</p>
<p>Homer, Mr. Burns holds a lot of sway at this club.</p>
<p>If you would keep quiet about the alleged... decades of cheating...</p>
<p>I'm sure he'd support your application for a membership tonight.</p>
<p>Bull hockey! I don't care about joining this stupid club.</p>
<p>But does your wife?</p>
<p>Ohh!</p>
<p><em>I knew my kind wasn't welcome here.</em></p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p>Ahh!</p>
<p>Eee!</p>
<p>Mom, you are looking fabulous!</p>
<p>Yeah. You look great. You can do anything with that sewing machine.</p>
<p>No, I can't. Come on, let's go.</p>
<p>You mean it's a new dress? Where did you get it?</p>
<p>The outlet store.</p>
<p>Wow! Two finds in one store.</p>
<p>What are the odds?</p>
<p>Call it fate. Let's go!</p>
<p>How much did it cost?</p>
<p>A dollar. Let's go!</p>
<p>With tax or without?</p>
<p>Without! Let me go!</p>
<p>So, with tax, how much was it?</p>
<p>Why do you always have to question everything I do?</p>
<p>You look nice, is all.</p>
<p><em>Homer, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Driving up to the main building.</em></p>
<p>They got valet parking tonight.</p>
<p>We can't drive this up there.</p>
<p>They'll see the dent. They'll see the coat hanger antenna.</p>
<p>Stop the car. Were walking.</p>
<p>But, Marge! Valets!</p>
<p>For once maybe someone will call me &quot;sir&quot; without adding, &quot;You're making a scene.&quot;</p>
<p>I'm gonna regale everyone with my anecdote.</p>
<p>You know, the one I tried to say on the radio?</p>
<p>Who's gonna bleep me this time?</p>
<p>I'm gonna pose as an ltalian count... and get some old lady to leave me all her money.</p>
<p>I'm gonna ask people if they know their servants' last names.</p>
<p>Or, in the case of butlers, their first.</p>
<p>No, no, no! Not tonight!</p>
<p><em>No vulgarity, no mischief, no politics.</em></p>
<p>Just be good!</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Mom. I'll behave.</p>
<p>I won't say anything controversial.</p>
<p>I just won't say anything. Okay, honey?</p>
<p>You kids should thank your mother.</p>
<p><em>Now that she's a better person... we can see how awful we really are.</em></p>
<p>Come here, Maggie.</p>
<p>Oh, Homie, I like your in-your-face humanity.</p>
<p>I like the way Lisa speaks her mind.</p>
<p>I like Bart's-</p>
<p>I like Bart.</p>
<p>And I like my old green dress.</p>
<p>I didn't have to spend our savings on this stupid gown.</p>
<p>Our savings?</p>
<p>Don't worry. I saved the receipt.</p>
<p>We'll have a $3,300 credit at Chanel.</p>
<p>They have beer and gum, right?</p>
<p>Come on. Let's go.</p>
<p><em>I wouldn't want to join any club that would have this me as a member.</em></p>
<p>It's okay. Those snobs never would've made us members anyway.</p>
<p>Well, I wonder where Marge could be.</p>
<p>She's missing her own initiation.</p>
<p>I hope she didn't take my attempt to destroy her too seriously.</p>
<p>Where's Homer? And to think I spent all afternoon baking him this cake.</p>
<p>Mmm! I- Ugh!</p>
<p>Mmm! I- Ugh!</p>
<p>I pickled the figs myself.</p>
<p>Hey, did you guys just come from the prom?</p>
<p>Sort of.</p>
<p>But you know, we realized we're more comfortable in a place like this.</p>
<p>Man, you're crazy! This place is a dump.</p>
<p>Oh, man! I'd be anywhere except this place. That's for sure.</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
