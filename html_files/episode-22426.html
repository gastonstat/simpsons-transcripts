The Musk Who Fell to Earth</p>
<p>(birds chirping)</p>
<p>Oh! Looks like our birdhouse is benefitting from positive word of beak. (laughs)</p>
<p>(eagle screeches)</p>
<p>A bald eagle!</p>
<p>It is!</p>
<p>(screeches)</p>
<p>Maybe he's giving those little baby birds some food.</p>
<p>(screams)</p>
<p>(screeches)</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>Homer, quick!</p>
<p>Get your shooing broom.</p>
<p>Marge, an eagle is our country's mascot!</p>
<p>Fighting him is like kicking George Washington in his wooden nuts!</p>
<p>Aah! (grunting)</p>
<p>(screeches)</p>
<p>(grunts)</p>
<p>Ow. Ow.</p>
<p>This means w*r!</p>
<p>Boy, bring my toupee.</p>
<p>Go ahead, boy.</p>
<p><strong>Milhouse</strong>: It's working!</p>
<p>It's definitely working!</p>
<p>For once, we're finally gonna catch that mouse.</p>
<p>(screeches)</p>
<p>Got you!</p>
<p>Ha.ha! Stupid eagle!</p>
<p>It wasn't the mouse we were after. It was you!</p>
<p>Marge, preheat the oven!</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>(screeching)</p>
<p>I got him cornered, boy!</p>
<p>Bag him up!</p>
<p>(screeching)</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>Not so majestic in a trash bag, are you?</p>
<p>Oopsie.</p>
<p>(puffing)</p>
<p>Seems almost a shame I'm gonna have to bang you against the wall till you die.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Let's take the eagle to Shelbyville Animal Rescue where you took that injured hummingbird you found on the front lawn.</p>
<p>Uh... um...</p>
<p>Or maybe we can nurse him back to health and set him free in the wild.</p>
<p>Okay, Bart, think of a name.</p>
<p>Make it great-- insanely, unbelievably great!</p>
<p>Squawky?</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Just like when we let you name Maggie.</p>
<p>(humming)</p>
<p>Squawky, until I met you, I never thought I could love something bald.</p>
<p>(screeches)</p>
<p>Bye!</p>
<p>We love you.</p>
<p>(all gasp)</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Brace yourselves, family.</p>
<p>We're about to meet a being with intelligence far beyond ours.</p>
<p>Boy, give me my baseball bat.</p>
<p>Hello. I'm Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Die!</p>
<p>What the...?</p>
<p>Dad, no! Elon Musk is possibly the greatest living inventor!</p>
<p>You're the guy who put wheels on luggage?</p>
<p>Oh, bless you!</p>
<p>Bless you!</p>
<p>(crying)</p>
<p>I'm-I'm not that guy.</p>
<p>His company perfected electric cars and then gave away the patents!</p>
<p>He changed the way Hollywood drives!</p>
<p>And now he's landed in our yard.</p>
<p>On my son's bike and on our mailman's leg.</p>
<p>Honey, guess who crushed me?</p>
<p>I'll give you a hint.</p>
<p>His first name is Elon.</p>
<p>Ah! That's right!</p>
<p>So, what brings you to Springfield, Mr. Musk?</p>
<p>What does bring me to Springfield?</p>
<p>Well, to start with, I'm an idea man.</p>
<p>It's my raison d'être.</p>
<p>Mmm, Raisin Detra.</p>
<p>I've hit a dry patch.</p>
<p>I'm blocked.</p>
<p>In my personal drought, I'm traveling the country quietly by spaceship, looking for... inspiration.</p>
<p>That's so sad.</p>
<p>Maybe we're the same.</p>
<p>Two lost ships in the intellectual sea.</p>
<p>Each of whom could inspire the other to reach...</p>
<p>Hey, Elon, if you're interested, you could come to the nuclear plant where I work tomorrow.</p>
<p>I am and I will!</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>And if anyone asks where I am, just cover for me.</p>
<p>Homer!</p>
<p>Fine!</p>
<p>We'll both go, and if anybody asks you something you don't understand, just say protons.</p>
<p>So... do you get satellite radio cheaper in space?</p>
<p>Homer, if we're gonna carpool together, there's one thing you have to know.</p>
<p>Ass, gas or grass-- no one rides for free.</p>
<p>It's as old as the Bible.</p>
<p>No, it's that I don't talk to anyone unless they provide the mental stimulation I seek.</p>
<p>Ditto.</p>
<p>(Lisa giggles nervously)</p>
<p>Hi. I didn't want to miss one more chance to spend time with Mr. Musk.</p>
<p>It is such an honor.</p>
<p>He is.</p>
<p>And may I save that paper?</p>
<p>&quot;No ideas.&quot; (gasps)</p>
<p>That's sad.</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>That's even worse.</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>Aw, man, I wish those were white meatballs.</p>
<p>(triumphant orchestra music playing)</p>
<p>Oh, my. That's an idea!</p>
<p>White meatballs-- synthetic meat that you can print in your printer.</p>
<p>Say something else.</p>
<p>Please! Now!</p>
<p>Uh... don't tase me, bro.</p>
<p>Chocolate rain!</p>
<p>Tase, bro, chocolate rain.</p>
<p>Use electroplating to remove metal ions from rainwater, making it suitable for drinking.</p>
<p>What about the chocolate?</p>
<p>We'll make the device a soothing chocolate color-- brilliant!</p>
<p>He's taking your Homerisms and turning them into his own great ideas!</p>
<p>This is the most inspirational moment of my life, but... unfortunately, this is my stop.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Well, come on, keep throwing things at me.</p>
<p>Um... (grunts)</p>
<p>Oh, this is a break.</p>
<p>We're-we're taking a break!</p>
<p>(grunts)</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>(both laughing)</p>
<p>I got you!</p>
<p><strong>Musk</strong>: You're fun.</p>
<p>Well, duh.</p>
<p>Why don't have fun like that, Lou?</p>
<p>(huffing)</p>
<p>Ah, Chief!</p>
<p>Did anyone ever tell you there's a safety on that g*n?</p>
<p>What do you mean this thing?</p>
<p>(grunts) That's the trigger!</p>
<p>What are you writing?</p>
<p>Share, buddy.</p>
<p>Suggestion for the suggestion box.</p>
<p>Can anyone make a suggestion?</p>
<p>Be my guest, but I seriously doubt the old man ever reads them.</p>
<p>Suggestion 8,432.</p>
<p>Nix!</p>
<p>Hmm, technically an order, not a suggestion.</p>
<p>&quot;Installing an MHD generator would allow the plant to operate at a higher temperature without the tyranny of moving parts using conducting plasma as the moving conductor&quot;?</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Clearly the work of Lenny.</p>
<p>That's the white one, right?</p>
<p>Is this your suggestion?</p>
<p>No. No, mine was rubber mats in the decontamination showers.</p>
<p>Also, water in the decontamination showers.</p>
<p>Never!</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Mm.</p>
<p>Good Lord!</p>
<p>Sir, you know who that is?</p>
<p>The man who's revolutionized the car industry.</p>
<p>Henry Ford, good to see you.</p>
<p>As healthy and vibrant as Detroit itself.</p>
<p>No, sir, this is Elon Musk.</p>
<p>For some reason, he's sharing a console with Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>His mind is as rich as an ltalian wedding soup.</p>
<p>Homer, what are you thinking now?</p>
<p>Uh, Pittsburgh 35, Dallas 31!</p>
<p>(triumphant orchestra music playing)</p>
<p>Pittsburgh steel, Dallas Cowboys...</p>
<p>Robotic cattle herding!</p>
<p>Thank you, Homer.</p>
<p>(gentle music playing)</p>
<p>Sorry, that's something I'm working on so that I don't have to display facial expressions.</p>
<p>(electrical crackling)</p>
<p>Young man, I look at you and I see myself.</p>
<p>How much would you charge to work for me?</p>
<p>I don't care about the money.</p>
<p>The whole monetary system is just a series of interconnected heterogeneous databases.</p>
<p>Could you repeat that first part?</p>
<p>I don't care about the money.</p>
<p>Once more... with feeling?</p>
<p>I don't care about the money.</p>
<p>Now, let me feel the vibrations of your lips.</p>
<p>(muffled): I don't care about the money.</p>
<p>And I want you to get your fingers out of my mouth!</p>
<p>Smithers, there's something strange in his mouth.</p>
<p>It's called moisture.</p>
<p>Hmm, I see.</p>
<p>Okay, Musk, what do you propose?</p>
<p>Well, you'll need to increase the capacity of your plant.</p>
<p>You cover the costs, you get 100% of the profits.</p>
<p>Careful, Elon, he's not as kindly as he appears.</p>
<p>(creaking)</p>
<p>Now, Burns, what if everything in town not powered by electricity were powered my electricity.</p>
<p>The electricity you sell them.</p>
<p>Imagine that.</p>
<p>(gasps) My doctor says I'm not allowed to imagine, so I hired someone to do it for me.</p>
<p>Send in the imaginer.</p>
<p>(humming)</p>
<p>Oh, that's fabulous.</p>
<p>Oh, my goodness, I can see everything.</p>
<p>I'm in.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, Mr. Burns?</p>
<p>I haven't been paid in a while.</p>
<p>Here you go. Imagine.</p>
<p>Ooh, Swiss francs!</p>
<p>Time to take my wife for a night on the town.</p>
<p>Hey, wait a minute!</p>
<p>(sniffs)</p>
<p>So, what kind of lunch do you pack?</p>
<p>Wow, Elon, you're like Willy Wonka without the underpaid munchkins.</p>
<p>Uh, I'd like to offer you something.</p>
<p>But all I got is coffee.</p>
<p>With cream!</p>
<p>Come on, I want cream.</p>
<p>Give it up.</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Cream and sugar are one thing too many!</p>
<p>(triumphant orchestra music playing)</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly!</p>
<p>What if we made the cream cup out of sugar so it dissolved in the coffee?</p>
<p>Wow. Wow!</p>
<p>Between your genius and my nothing, we make a great team!</p>
<p>Come on, give me a hug.</p>
<p>Sorry, I'm not one for hugging.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not one for just talking.</p>
<p>(violin playing romantic melody)</p>
<p>Does that drone do date nights with the wife?</p>
<p>My partner, Montgomery Burns...</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Boo!</p>
<p>...and I... (cheering) Hooray! have exciting news. Springfield Nuclear has electric solutions to all of your energy needs. The Springfield Hyperloop.</p>
<p>Electrifying the school to replace the old power source, Willy pushing a wheel.</p>
<p>(drumming rhythmically)</p>
<p>And my passion project, the Glayvinator.</p>
<p>You have a Glayvinator, too?</p>
<p>Is it, um, uh, patent-pending?</p>
<p>Patent granted.</p>
<p>All the years of Glayvining in my basement for naught!</p>
<p>I'm a failure.</p>
<p>Ah, yes, everyone's been there.</p>
<p>You have those feelings, too?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>If I knew how to make a fist, I'd hit you.</p>
<p>This is wonderful, Smithers.</p>
<p>For once in my life, something's going my way.</p>
<p>I'm not so sure.</p>
<p>Oh, another visit from Mr. Worrywart.</p>
<p>I don't trust Musk.</p>
<p>Anyone with that much money has a darkness in his soul.</p>
<p>Says you.</p>
<p>(sighs)</p>
<p><strong>Smithers</strong>: <em>Mr. Burns?</em></p>
<p>Mr. Burns?</p>
<p>Sir, Musk's ideas sound great, too great.</p>
<p>We're meant for wretched lives.</p>
<p>We should pass on this.</p>
<p>And before you reply, remember, I've never let you down.</p>
<p>You know what I'm going to say, right?</p>
<p>Release the...</p>
<p>I was going to say &quot;Get out,&quot; but your idea sounds better.</p>
<p>(sighs) Can you give me a ten-second head start?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>One, two, three!</p>

<p>(chuckles) Well, you be careful up there, Arnie.</p>
<p>No need.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk gave me a self-flying chopper!</p>
<p>Where's Arnie?</p>

<p>Welcome, friends.</p>
<p>I have invited you here to share in our first quarterly profit report.</p>
<p>I'm sure you're all eager to hear how much richer I am.</p>
<p>Now, to end the suspense, Elon?</p>
<p>Thank you, Monty.</p>
<p>At our current rate...</p>
<p>Yes? assuming a linear growth model...</p>
<p>Of course!</p>

<p>No, no, no!</p>
<p>Musk, you tricked me.</p>
<p>Not a trick.</p>
<p>We sacrifice now to take care of the future in a way totally determined by me.</p>
<p>(groans) All I wanted was to make obscene profits in the last year of my life and leave it to no one.</p>
<p>Why does God hate dreamers?</p>
<p>Due to recent fluctuations in my judgment, and the once in a lifetime mistake of trusting another human being, I am saddened to announce massive layoffs.</p>
<p>Who will pay for my radiation sickness treatments?</p>
<p>Not my concern.</p>
<p>But Musk was our savior!</p>
<p>Your so-called savior isn't interested in saving anything but the world. Bah!</p>
<p>Burns' layoffs have thrown the city into a new depression, marked by the singing of songs from the old depression.</p>

<p>(distorted): You're... welcome.</p>
<p>(whistles)</p>
<p>You really came back from that Tommy John surgery.</p>
<p>Tell Musk there's more where that came from.</p>
<p>More of what? (groans)</p>
<p><strong>Burns</strong>: <em>Smithers,</em> the hounds feel terrible for what they did, and good news, one pooped out your ear.</p>
<p>We'll dip it in iodine, and it's just like new.</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>Also, I'm sorry, I couldn't find the records of the shots the hounds had which, in turn, led to all those painful injections in your abdomen.</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>Now, the reason I'm here...</p>
<p>I've made the calls.</p>
<p>I'm gonna have Elon Musk k*ll, and I'll give you a little extra morphine, friend.</p>
<p>(screaming)</p>
<p>(dogs snarling)</p>
<p>Oh, right, that's a trapdoor.</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>What's wrong, Homer?</p>
<p>Is it that all your friends are out of work, and it's kind of your fault?</p>
<p>(scoffs) No, it's Elon.</p>
<p>I don't care how much he likes me, I don't want to be friends with him anymore.</p>
<p>None of his pie in the sky ideas ever work out.</p>
<p>Sky pies are lie pies.</p>
<p>Of all the planets in the universe, why did he have to come to this one?</p>
<p>How do you break up with a guy?</p>
<p>Here's what you do.</p>
<p>You just take his hand, look in his eyes, and say, &quot;I don't want to be with you anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>Wow, you're good at that.</p>
<p>It's gotten me out of a lot of gym memberships.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>Sir, I have my concern about the team of hit men you've assembled.</p>
<p>They seem a little long in the tooth.</p>
<p>Nonsense. Just because a man can't see or hold his hands steady doesn't make him any less of a marksman.</p>
<p>A yoga mat that rolls itself up.</p>
<p>Silent Velcro, baseball tickets that guide you to your seat.</p>
<p>(g*n)</p>
<p>Sweet Columbian Exposition!</p>
<p>Musk lives.</p>
<p>But, uh, three of your hit men don't.</p>
<p>Recoil was pretty bad.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, Oh, my God.</p>
<p>You saved my life!</p>
<p>Which is gonna make what I'm about to say even more awkward.</p>
<p>Whatever you want, we'll make it work, right, Homer?</p>
<p>Elon, Elon, Elon, I want to say something to you, and I don't want you to be inspired by it.</p>
<p>I want you to listen.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>I don't want to be with you anymore.</p>
<p>Can I ask why?</p>
<p>I could say it's the being sh*t at, or the flat, emotionless way you talk, or the fact that PayPal was my idea, and I was just about to do it when you came out with it, but really it's that this town isn't ready for you.</p>
<p>And neither am I.</p>
<p>It's okay; I'll be fine.</p>
<p>(gentle music playing)</p>
<p>It's on your face, too.</p>
<p>Well, I did save you one last prize from the Cracker Jack box that is my brain.</p>
<p>Use it as you will.</p>
<p>On the Miami Dolphins helmet, the little dolphin is also wearing a helmet.</p>
<p>Why are they always the most beautiful just when they're breaking up with you?</p>
<p>I think it's time to tell my luggage to self pack. (beeps)</p>
<p>Good-bye, Elon.</p>
<p>Our town will never forgive you.</p>
<p>Thanks for the real working lightsaber.</p>
<p>(whooshing)</p>
<p><em>Ay, caramba!</em></p>
<p>(giggles)</p>
<p>I just wanted to see if there was a better life, even for a little bit.</p>
<p>When you're 16, I'll drive you to Cincinnati, and you'll see what there is to see.</p>
<p>Mr. Musk, before you go, is there anything you could do to give a little girl hope that the world of the future won't be as grim as all our current movies forecast?</p>
<p>I guess humanity wants its change one birdhouse at a time.</p>
<p>Hmm, for a man who likes electric cars, he sure burns a lot of rocket fuel.</p>
<p>(moans)</p>
<p>What's wrong, Dad?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Elon's log, Earth date, 25 January, 2015.</p>
<p>I have left Springfield forever, but there are some things I will definitely miss.</p>
<p>The little dolphin is also wearing a helmet.</p>
<p>Wearing a helmet.</p>
<p>Wearing a helmet.</p>
<p>I never thought I'd say this, but sometimes holograms miss the point.</p>
