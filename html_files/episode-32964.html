<p>[YAWNING LOUDLY]  </p>
<p>Ah.  </p>
<p>In case you were wondering why I'm so tired...  </p>
<p>- I wasn't.<br />
- I was up late watching French films... in French.  </p>
<p>And then, last night, my dreams were in French!  </p>
<p>My dream is you keep moving.  </p>
<p>FRENCH NARRATOR: <em>Lisa Simpson, a bright girl in a dull school.</em>   </p>
<p><em>She likes the sound a Sharpie makes</em>   </p>
<p><em>when she does well on a test.</em>   </p>
<p>[SQUEAKING]   </p>
<p><em>She adores the woody sweetness of a fresh baritone reed.</em>   </p>
<p>Mmm.   </p>
<p><em>But she hates, more than anything,</em>   </p>
<p><em>finding a place to eat at lunch.</em>   </p>
<p>♪ ♪   </p>
<p>[GASPS, GROANS]   </p>
<p>[SIGHS]   </p>
<p><em>What was this?</em>   </p>
<p><em>You will soon see.</em>   </p>
<p><em>Frankly, I am redundant.</em>   </p>
<p>&quot;J. Beardsley.&quot;   </p>
<p>[GASPS] Jasper!   </p>
<p>FRENCH NARRATOR: <em>Suddenly, in the middle</em>   </p>
<p><em>of this crap school, a mystery!</em>   </p>
<p><em>Meanwhile, for the first time in his life,</em>   </p>
<p><em>Homer would be disappointed in a kitchen.</em>   </p>
<p>Oh, my God. Leftovers!   </p>
<p>Air, nothing, more air, space, air, not spaghetti, not meatloaf, missing chili, absence of mac and cheese!   </p>
<p>There must be some food here.   </p>
<p>[GASPS]   </p>
<p>The devil's trees.   </p>
<p>No!   </p>
<p>- Homie, relax.<br />
- Okay.   </p>
<p>I've decided to be a Tubberware salesperson.   </p>
<p>Tubberware? Isn't that the thing where you find people to host parties where you then sell everyone plastic food boxes?   </p>
<p>Well, you do your Kickstarters.   </p>
<p>Hey, if people pay to send me on my tour of rocking chairs in the Midwest, that helps everyone.   </p>
<p>We really could use the money.   </p>
<p>They're still garnishing your wages after that garnish w*r you waged.   </p>
<p>Please, Homie.   </p>
<p>I want to open a checking account so the family finally has one.   </p>
<p>Marge, no wife of mine will ever have to work.   </p>
<p>Is what men used to say for some insane reason.   </p>
<p>You have my blessing.   </p>
<p>Where's Jasper? He's late again.   </p>
<p>Maybe we should feed the birds without him.   </p>
<p>Don't tell me you fed the birds without me?   </p>
<p>You were in a coma!   </p>
<p><em>Mein Gott,</em> what else happened?   </p>
<p>You won't like who's president.   </p>
<p>It's not Bernie?   </p>
<p><em>[AMÉLIE</em> THEME PLAYS]   </p>
<p>FRENCH NARRATOR: <em>Lisa returned Jasper's childhood,</em>   </p>
<p><em>and all she wanted was her own secret giggle.</em>   </p>
<p>[WHISPERS]: Jasper.   </p>
<p>[GASPS, COUGHS]   </p>
<p>Oh, my God.   </p>
<p>What do you got there? A bento box?   </p>
<p>Somebody's ashes? Apple TV?   </p>
<p>Oy. One more guess, and I'm gonna need a nap.   </p>
<p>When I was six years old,   </p>
<p>I brought my treasure box for show-and-tell.   </p>
<p>Another kid took it, never gave it back.   </p>
<p>[CRIES SOFTLY]<br />
And now, somehow, it's here.   </p>
<p>I've been angry my whole life, but suddenly, the world seems... magical.   </p>
<p>FRENCH NARRATOR:<br />
<em>For the first time ever,</em>   </p>
<p><em>Lisa experienced a feeling</em>   </p>
<p><em>that could only be described</em> <em>as...</em> magnifique.   </p>
<p>I don't mean to overstate this, but the sun is shining a little bit brighter, because of me!   </p>
<p>Tubberware? I'd love to buy some.   </p>
<p>No, you don't buy it now.   </p>
<p>You have a party, and then I sell it to your friends.   </p>
<p>- No!<br />
- [SIGHS]   </p>
<p>You have the party at your house...   </p>
<p>Oh.   </p>
<p>Then, when your friends fill out the order forms, we...   </p>
<p>Oh.   </p>
<p>If you host a Tubberware party, you get an exclusive gift: a lemonade pitcher!   </p>
<p>Ma'am, if the good Lord wanted us to store juice in plastic, he wouldn't have made a possum's bladder watertight.   </p>
<p>JULIO: <em>Okay, Marge, you're like</em> a black hole of sadness and split ends.   </p>
<p>What is wrong with you?   </p>
<p>I haven't booked a single Tubberware party.   </p>
<p>I don't know why I thought I could do this.   </p>
<p>I don't have that... What's the Jewish word for &quot;chutzpah&quot;?    </p>
<p>You mean you have no confidence?    </p>
<p>I don't. I always take the bad pancake.    </p>
<p>I spend so much time putting sunscreen on everyone else, I get sunburned.    </p>
<p>Ooh. Just like with a doormat, the key is underneath.    </p>
<p>- Huh?<br />
- You know what?    </p>
<p>I will throw a Tubberware party for you.    </p>
<p>But it's gonna take me a while to plan.    </p>
<p>- How about tonight?<br />
- You're on!    </p>
<p>What the heck are you doing?    </p>
<p>That's a punchbowl, and that's for leftover lasagna.    </p>
<p>What?! Whoever heard of<em> leftover</em> lasagna?    </p>
<p>[GROANS] Maybe you should just go to Moe's.    </p>
<p>Fine, but I'm not gonna get drunk.    </p>
<p>Oh, okay, sweetie, I'll get drunk.    </p>
<p>I just can't stay sober at you.    </p>
<p>[GROANS] Ah!    </p>
<p>I can't do this. I can't do this!    </p>
<p>Can't? Can't? Marge, I never want to hear you use the C-A-next-Tuesday word again.    </p>
<p>You need to tap into your female warrior side.    </p>
<p>I don't have one of those.    </p>
<p>Then we're gonna have to create one!    </p>
<p>Makeover time!    </p>
<p>[AIR COMPRESSOR WHIRRING]    </p>
<p>Okay, think pretty thoughts!    </p>
<p>[HISSING]    </p>
<p>Now, get rid of those things on your feet and put these on.    </p>
<p>Mmm. It changes my whole body.    </p>
<p>[GASPS] And what is going on back there?    </p>
<p>Behold, your rump has become... a booty, baby!    </p>
<p>Mm-hmm.    </p>
<p>Now go out there and sell some thingies!    </p>
<p>Mmm.    </p>
<p>GRADY: <em>Julio,</em> what is this? I don't want to sit through some kind of sales pitch.    </p>
<p>I just want a simple evening of appetizers, cocktails and nitrous oxide.    </p>
<p>[LOWER VOICE]: Hello, boys.    </p>
<p>I see you're checking out the merchandise.    </p>
<p>Let me assure you, the lids match the tubs.    </p>
<p>[ALL LAUGHING]    </p>
<p>Mm. Mm-hmm.    </p>
<p>Oh. You should have told us this was a drag Tubberware party.    </p>
<p>He's the most convincing woman I've ever seen.    </p>
<p>Oh, oh, yes, yes.    </p>
<p><em>He</em> is quite the impersonator.    </p>
<p>He calls himself &quot;Marge.&quot;    </p>
<p>Perfect! &quot;Marge.&quot;    </p>
<p>If she were any more camp, she'd be a Coleman lantern.    </p>
<p>All right, boys, let's put tops on bottoms.    </p>
<p>[ALL LAUGHING]    </p>
<p>And you wanted to go dancing.    </p>
<p>Mm. Mm-mm-mm-mm.    </p>
<p>And voilà... a Marge-tini!    </p>
<p>But don't worry.    </p>
<p>That's not the only surprise I've got tucked away.    </p>
<p>- She's funny.<br />
- Bea Arthur funny?    </p>
<p>No one's that funny.    </p>
<p>FRENCH NARRATOR: <em>And that night, Marge sold more Tubberware</em>    </p>
<p><em>than she ever imagined.</em>    </p>
<p><em>And I, drawn by the farcical premise,</em>    </p>
<p><em>began narrating her story, too.</em>    </p>
<p>Look at all these orders!    </p>
<p>I'm really good at this.    </p>
<p>Yeah, well, uh, you see, um...    </p>
<p>&quot;Marge&quot; is good at this.    </p>
<p>Yeah, Marge. Me. I'm Marge.    </p>
<p>Okay, so here's what happened, okay?    </p>
<p>This is so important, I'm gonna drop the accent.    </p>
<p>[WITHOUT ACCENT]: Everyone thought    </p>
<p>- you were a drag queen.<br />
- [GASPS]    </p>
<p>I felt so pretty, but the whole time, people thought I was a man.    </p>
<p>A man who looked like a fabulous woman!    </p>
<p>Drag queens can be very beautiful. Exhibit: me.    </p>
<p>I call myself &quot;Penelope Cruising.&quot;    </p>
<p>I was Mr. Burns's date for the Kennedy Center Honors.    </p>
<p>See? Look how cute I am.    </p>
<p>All his dates have to give him transfusions.    </p>
<p>Now I know why he said I was his type.    </p>
<p>You get it?    </p>
<p>Well, the next time, I'm just going to be myself.    </p>
<p>But that<em> was</em> you, you with confidence.    </p>
<p>Oh, you're just being nice.    </p>
<p>It was ju! It was ju! It was ju!    </p>
<p>And besides, the top Tubberware sellers... they're all drag queens.    </p>
<p>What? That can't be true.    </p>
<p>So, what do you say, Marge?<br />
Are you in it to win it?    </p>
<p>CONTAINER: Go for it, Marge!    </p>
<p>Who cares if what's outside doesn't match what's inside?    </p>
<p>I'm labeled &quot;Lunch Snacks,&quot; but people use me to store pot.    </p>
<p>And I'm for storing bread.    </p>
<p>All the bread you're gonna make selling Tubberware.    </p>
<p>Did you just high-five that bowl?    </p>
<p>Be cool, Marge. Be cool.    </p>
<p>Homer, order anything you like.<br />
It's on me.    </p>
<p><em>Anything.</em>    </p>
<p>Okay. I'm gonna need two menus and four tables.    </p>
<p>And get rid of all this silverware.    </p>
<p>- It just slows me down.<br />
- I got it. I got it.    </p>
<p>We need help. Someone get Mama back from bingo.    </p>
<p>I am on my way.    </p>
<p>But all you need is a &quot;G.&quot;    </p>
<p>You should be like the &quot;G&quot; in gnocchi... silent!    </p>
<p>Mmm. Oh, Marge, thank you.    </p>
<p>Thank you. I'm so happy!    </p>
<p>And there it is.    </p>
<p>Leftover lasagna.    </p>
<p>D'oh!    </p>
<p>FRENCH NARRATOR: <em>Lisa still</em> <em>felt sort of</em> magnifique,    </p>
<p><em>but the magical feeling from her good deed started to fade.</em>    </p>
<p><em>So she thought: why not secretly bring magic into others' lives?</em>    </p>
<p>Yes.    </p>
<p>FRENCH NARRATOR: <em>Her first project: restore the lost love</em>    </p>
<p><em>between the identical-looking Kirk and Luann.</em>    </p>
<p><em>[AMÉLIE</em> THEME PLAYS]    </p>
<p>KIRK: <em>Looks like dying my nose hair's really paying off!</em>    </p>
<p>FRENCH NARRATOR: <em>Next, Lisa helped Gil,</em>    </p>
<p><em>Springfield's Pepé Le Pew, minus the charm.</em>    </p>
<p>Sir, would ya like one? No, huh? Well, I guess not.    </p>
<p>Ma'am? Uh, maybe next time.    </p>
<p>Come on! I only get paid if they're all gone.    </p>
<p>And they check the trash, believe me.    </p>
<p>Oh, my God. People are taking them!    </p>
<p>I'm turning the heat on in my car tonight.    </p>
<p>LISA: <em>Bart. Wake up.</em>    </p>
<p>Bart! I need your help again.    </p>
<p>FRENCH NARRATOR: <em>But Lisa's greatest challenge</em>    </p>
<p><em>was to make Mrs. Skinner believe in her son again.</em>    </p>
<p><em>So Lisa created an imaginary journal for Seymour,</em>    </p>
<p><em>one that would mend all fences.</em>    </p>
<p>I have to get this fake diary into Skinner's house.    </p>
<p>Here's the key.    </p>
<p>Here's a floor plan of the house.    </p>
<p>Oh, and here's some tuna. I'm making his cat really fat.    </p>
<p>[YAWNING]    </p>
<p><em>So Lisa hid the diary</em>    </p>
<p><em>where she knew Mrs. Skinner would find it...</em>    </p>
<p><em>anywhere a grown man would expect privacy.</em>    </p>
<p>Huh?    </p>
<p>&quot;Mother is a great woman.&quot;    </p>
<p>[GASPS] Seymour loves me!    </p>
<p>Oh, my God! How does a mother apologize for    years of ridiculing her son?    </p>
<p>A gift card now, and an apology on my deathbed.    </p>
<p><em>Meanwhile, to help perfect her art and increase business,</em>    </p>
<p><em>Julio took Marge</em>    </p>
<p><em>to Springfield's hottest drag club,</em>    </p>
<p><em>with its most confusing bathroom signage.</em>    </p>
<p>Marge, this is Queen Chanté, Barbra Streisman, the Mysterious Waylon, and Fiona Adams Apple.    </p>
<p>Hello, squirrel-friend.    </p>
<p>You're the tallest thing I ever...    </p>
<p>[GASPS] And you're still getting up.    </p>
<p>Honey, I spend half my day getting up and the other half getting<em> down.</em>    </p>
<p>- Oh-kurr?!<br />
- This is the kind of confidence that you need.    </p>
<p>The secret is to imagine  the fiercest version of yourself, then realize... you<em> are</em> that version!    </p>
<p>Mel, is that you?    </p>
<p>Yes! I've taped my bone between my legs.    </p>
<p>Your Majesty, can Marge lip-synch with us?    </p>
<p>Honey, I'll tell you what I told Eddie Murphy:    </p>
<p>&quot;Sure, why not?&quot;    </p>
<p>So, tell me about this &quot;Marge&quot; character.    </p>
<p>What is she like?    </p>
<p>Well, she's long-suffering, kind of a single mom... and that's it.    </p>
<p>She's a damn hero, is what she is, sis. [CLUCKS TONGUE]    </p>
