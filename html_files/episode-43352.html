<p>That?</p>

<p>Dad looks happy.</p>
<p>Something's deeply wrong.</p>
<p>He's missing his youthful spirit,  that spark that makes him who he is.</p>
<p>Did you see how he ate his breakfast?</p>
<p>He didn't shuffle his pancakes  like a deck of cards.</p>
<p>He doesn't air-drum while driving  or race the dog in butt scooting across the carpet.</p>
<p>And he always won.</p>
<p>He's not my Homie anymore.</p>
<p>We didn't notice any of that.</p>
<p>(scoffs)</p>
<p>A wife knows.</p>
<p>And a bartender.</p>
<p>He's just...</p>
<p>he's just not the same.</p>
<p>He don't spin Barney around on the stool no more.</p>
<p>He don't drink beer from a crazy straw... just a sensible straw.</p>
<p>What are we gonna do about our little man, Midge?</p>
<p>We're just gonna have to love him that much more.</p>
<p>I didn't think that was possible.</p>

<p>Rapping pizza robots?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>It's a very Dad kind of trauma.</p>
<p>Well, if losing those robots screwed him up, what if we somehow found them again?</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Dad told us Gil used to be his boss,  so maybe Gil could help us.</p>
<p>And I know just where to find him.</p>

<p>Ah, the drugs sold themselves, kid.</p>
<p>The whole world was my nostril.</p>
<p>Look, after you &quot;went away,&quot;  what happened to those singing robots?</p>
<p>Well, the FBI sold them at auction, but I never lost track of my babies.</p>
<p>I'm gonna get those robots back,  and start a new kiddie pizza place,  then use that as a front to sell even better drugs!</p>

<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>Where-where are you going with that?</p>
<p>We're taking it to the new local offices of J.J.</p>
<p>Abrams.</p>
<p>J.J. Abrams.</p>
<p>What's a big Hollywood director doing in Springfield?</p>
<p>Making the next Mission: Impossible.</p>
<p>Downtown Springfield's standing in for Somalia.</p>
<p>What does he want with this rickety piece of junk?</p>
<p>As a visionary genius,  J.J. needs to be kept in a constant state  of childlike wonder, so we fill his creative space with kitsch, whimsy, memorabilia.</p>
<p>- (phone dings)</p>
<p>- (all gasp)</p>
<p>J.J. needs a Garbage Pail Kids pinball machine  and a roll of 1982 quarters.</p>
<p>Go, go, go!</p>
<p>Can I help you?</p>
<p>Yeah, we're a cool, young, brother-sister directing team and we'd like to speak  to a low-level executive about a vague idea we have.</p>
<p>Super vague.</p>
<p>Right away!</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>There's the yak.</p>
<p>But how are we gonna get it out of here?</p>
<p>Step away from the kitsch.</p>
<p>What are you thinking, trying to steal from a Hollywood big sh*t?</p>
<p>That's like m*rder a dozen normos.</p>
<p>Sorry, Dad.</p>
<p>We thought it would make you happy if we got your old band back together.</p>

<p>Oh, no, I'm wearing the same shirt as him.</p>
<p>Aah!</p>
<p>- Hi, I'm J.J.</p>
<p>- Homer Jay.</p>
<p>Sorry my kids tried to steal from you.</p>
<p>It's just that they were trying  to get this old robot back, so... so...</p>
<p>So they could reunite the entire animatronic band  to heal the broken teenager inside of you.</p>
<p>(all gasp)</p>
<p>How did you know my secret pain?</p>
<p>I didn't.</p>
<p>My storytelling sense told me  this was the only emotionally cathartic end to your journey.</p>

<p>You're all here.</p>
<p>I've never seen such genuine childlike wonder.</p>
<p>And I've been to dozens of test screenings.</p>
<p>Homer, your emotional connection to these characters has shown me that your journey can be  a universal experience, </p>
<p>- or at least Dreamworks.</p>
<p>- What?</p>
<p>I have wonderful news: I'm gonna make these robots the stars of their own nine-movie franchise.</p>
<p>Buy the underlying IP.</p>
<p>- Done.</p>
<p>You own it.</p>
<p>- Fantastic.</p>
<p>Take them away.</p>
<p>Take them?</p>
<p>But we just got reunited.</p>
<p>Oh, but I need them.</p>
<p>My visual effects artists have to scan them into supercomputers so our mind-blowing reboot will make its release date:  March 30...</p>
<p>The new Fourth of July.</p>
<p>No!</p>

<p>It's what I do.</p>
<p>I had them back and I lost them again.</p>
<p>Homie, I know how hard this is for you.</p>
<p>I always say you shouldn't do this,  but maybe... just this once...</p>
<p>You should go eat your feelings.</p>
<p>Six feelings with extra cheese.</p>
<p>An order of French feelings,  and a super chocolate frosty depression.</p>
<p>I also recommend a hot apple cry.</p>
<p>Yes, I recognize a fellow sadness swallower.</p>
<p>And then J.J. Abrams took my robots away...</p>
<p>so he could reboot them.</p>
<p>Why do Hollywood guys only want to make movies?</p>
<p>I used to be like you, getting angry at filmmakers who ruined my favorite childhood characters,  stewing in silence.</p>
<p>But now,  thanks to the Internet, I can fight back.</p>
<p>- You can?</p>
<p>- Oh, yes, my friend.</p>
<p>It is called &quot;trolling.&quot; </p>
<p>Thanks to social media super-soldiers like myself, studios spent millions to remove Sonic the Hedgehog's creepy human teeth.</p>
<p>We changed the world  of video game adaptations I never saw.</p>
<p>Then I'll do it.</p>
<p>I'll become a troll, stop J.J. Abrams' reboot,  and save my childhood.</p>
<p>And now I'm eating a feeling I've never felt before.</p>
<p>♪  Marge, I've done it.</p>
<p>The boycott is gaining momentum...</p>
<p>The supportive comments are pouring in.</p>
<p>Three of them!</p>
<p>Homer, please.</p>
<p>You've missed so much of your life.</p>
<p>Of our lives.</p>
<p>It's only a movie.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe you're right.</p>
<p>Maybe I have been  taking this nostalgia-fueled vendetta too far.</p>
<p>- (computer dings)</p>
<p>- (gasps)</p>
<p>Pizza movie news alert.</p>
<p>Hey, Springfield.</p>
<p>I'm inviting you  to come to the Aztec Theatre tonight for a special preview of my new animated movie, Agents of P.I.Z.Z.A.</p>
<p>How dare he do what he said he was gonna do!</p>
<p>I paused just long enough for anyone watching  to say something.</p>
<p>And now, here's a little... &quot;slice&quot; of what you'll see tonight.</p>
<p>NARRATOR: They'll save the world in 90 minutes...</p>
<p>or the movie is free.</p>
<p>Written by Tony Kushner and Babaloo Mandel.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>This reimagining is worse than I could have ever imagined.</p>
<p>I've got to stop that screening.</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>There's only one person who can help my Homie now.</p>
<p>- Who are you calling?</p>
<p>- No, don't tell us...</p>
<p>It'll be cooler when we find out later.</p>
<p>(indistinct chatter)</p>
<p>Reboots suck and you're to blame,  make it different, but the same!</p>
<p>Thank you, loyal trolls, for joining me  in my passion project:  destroying someone else's passion project.</p>
<p>Yes, every fan deserves movies that are individually tailored  to their preconceived ideas.</p>
<p>Let's ruin everyone's night!</p>
<p>(applause)</p>
<p>Welcome to this preview of Agents of P.I.Z.Z.A., featuring the voice talents of whoever was famous eight months ago.</p>
<p>(all quietly exclaiming)</p>
<p>But the real heroes are the thousands of computer artists who worked around the clock, slowly going blind, at such effects houses as  Dream Prison, Digital Sweatshop, Indentured Server-dudes, and too many others to count.</p>
<p>- Or pay.</p>
<p>- MAN: Yeah!</p>
<p>And now, without further ado...</p>
<p>Did somebody ask for ado?</p>
<p>(all gasp)</p>
<p>Hey, Homer.</p>
<p>Good to see you.</p>
<p>Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?</p>
<p>This man took simple, beautiful animal robots  designed to sell pizza  and turned them into something crass and commercial.</p>
<p>Well, it's all over, J.J....</p>
<p>If those are your real initials.</p>
<p>I'm going to burn the only copy of this movie.</p>
<p>Actually, the movie's backed up on servers all over the world.</p>
<p>That reel is just a prop from the snack stand.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I wondered why it was buttery.</p>
<p>You can't release this movie.</p>
<p>Changing those characters </p>
<p>- will ruin my childhood.</p>
<p>- GRAMPA: Bullpucky!</p>
<p>(all gasp)</p>
<p>(grunts)</p>
<p>So that's who Mom called earlier.</p>
<p>So satisfying.</p>
<p>Son, a movie can't ruin your childhood.</p>
<p>I ruined it by being a terrible father.</p>
<p>- But the movie.</p>
<p>- No, it was me.</p>
<p>I put you down, I never listened to you, said your dreams were ridiculous.</p>
<p>Maybe it was the way I was brought up.</p>
<p>Men back then could only love sports stars and auto makes.</p>
<p>I was a Chevy man and I thought that was enough.</p>
<p>The '63 Impala SS sport coupe...</p>
<p>Now, that was a son.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>It's not the movie that sucks, it was you sucking.</p>
<p>It was always you sucking.</p>
<p>I hate you, Dad.</p>
<p>ALL: Aw.</p>
<p>Homer, I know you were attached to the past,  but this movie...</p>
<p>All 71 minutes of it...</p>
<p>Might help a new generation of kids  forget their terrible parents.</p>
<p>- Like us, Dad.</p>
<p>- I want to forget so bad.</p>
<p>- Mm.</p>
<p>- Go on, make your movie.</p>
<p>It's literally already done.</p>
<p>I guess the only time I'll see my friends now  is on the big screen.</p>
<p>Well, actually...</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>The band is back together.</p>
<p>I had them reprogrammed to dispense frozen yogurt at the after party.</p>
<p>Goodbye, old friend.</p>
<p>You'll always be a part of me.</p>
<p>Ah...</p>
<p>COMIC BOOK GUY: To all who dare reboot a movie, comic book, or TV show...</p>
<p>You are being watched by Troll Force Five!</p>
<p>Mary Sue, who writes fan fiction starring herself.</p>
<p>&quot;Harry Potter turned and said, 'Without Mary Sue, I never could have brought Dumbledore back to life.'&quot; </p>
<p>COMIC BOOK GUY: The Furry... the ultimate expert on poorly-rendered CGI hair.</p>
<p>That's not what it looks like when a bear sweats.</p>
<p>COMIC BOOK BUY: The Shipper... able to detect romantic connections where, clearly, none exist.</p>
<p>C-3PO and Chewbacca are definitely a couple.</p>
<p>COMIC BOOK GUY: Stan, who can ruin anything by loving it too much.</p>
<p>Together, we are...</p>
<p>We go further, so you can.</p>
