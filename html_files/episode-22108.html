<p>[ Man ] Look at her vacuum. onto the sands of Superstar Bay.</p>
<p>♪ [ Dramatic Cue ]</p>
<p>But behind the chortles, this funny five some was trapped in a private hell.</p>
<p>Everybody wanted a piece of us.</p>
<p>They told us what to wear... how to dress, which clothes we should put on.</p>
<p>The cops found me driving on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>I had no business hosting the Oscars.</p>
<p>After the show, Meryl Streep spit on me.</p>
<p>[Narrator] tonight: the Simpsons, as you've never seen them before... on Behind the Laughter.</p>
<p>♪ [ Rock]</p>
<p>♪ [ Ends ]</p>
<p>[ Narrator] the Simpson's amazing journey began here... in the bustling heartland town of Springfield.</p>
<p>On this unassuming street, two nobodies... named Homer and Marge Simpson settled down to raise a family.</p>
<p>First came baby Bart. [ Babbling ] then, Lisa Simpson.</p>
<p>[ Babbling ]</p>
<p>[ Chuckles, Gasps ]</p>
<p>[ Grunting ]</p>
<p>And finally, Maggie.</p>
<p>[ Snoring ]</p>
<p>[ Gasps ] Eh!</p>
<p>Nobody told us how tough it is to raise kids.</p>
<p>They almost drove me to fortified wine.</p>
<p>Then we figured out we could park them in front of the TV.</p>
<p>That's how I was raised, and I turned out TV.</p>
<p>I'd see 'em sitting on that couch all day long... just staring at that Hollywood Hogwash.</p>
<p>Our favorite show was Hollywood Hogwash, but we also loved the Dreck Squad. the Malarkeys, Dumbin' it Down.</p>
<p>Sheriff Lowbrow.</p>
<p>Home lmprovement.</p>
<p>But we never saw people like us on TV.</p>
<p>TV families were always hugging and tackling issues.</p>
<p>Homer kept saying he could do a more realistic family show.</p>
<p>Finally, I said, &quot;So do it.</p>
<p>Either [ Bleep] or get off the pot.&quot;</p>
<p>[Narrator] And[Bleep] he did.</p>
<p>Using his home as the studio and his family as the cast... this penniless Peckinpah sh*t a crude five-minute video.</p>
<p>My Funny Family, take one!</p>
<p>And... action!</p>
<p>Honey, I 'm home. The boss is coming to dinner, and I need a clean shirt.</p>
<p>I haven't done the laundry yet.</p>
<p>Mamma mia! Now I'll have to do it!</p>
<p>♪ [ Humming ]</p>
<p>Dad, that's too much detergent.</p>

<p>[ Both Gasp]</p>
<p>Simpson!</p>
<p>Where's my dinner?.</p>
<p>Mamma mia!</p>
<p>It was amazing how fast Dad betrayed his vision of a realistic show.</p>
<p>Okay, the material was a little corny.</p>
<p>But Homer and I had real chemistry on screen.</p>
<p>Every day I thought about firing Marge.</p>
<p>You know, just to shake things up.</p>
<p>[Narrator] Homer didn't fire Marge, but he did shake things up- show business things.</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>[ Horn Honks ]</p>
<p>[ Narrator] He tried to show his demo tape to the major networks... but couldn't get past the guards.</p>
<p>[ Clanks ]</p>
<p>[ Clanks ]</p>
<p>[ Clanking Continues ]</p>
<p>Fortunately, I had a network connection.</p>
<p>The man who cut my hair was also president of Fox.</p>
<p>♪ [Studio Fanfare ]</p>
<p>[ Narrator] the Simpsons had their foot in the door.</p>
<p>Fox ordered 13 episodes. But would the public respond?</p>
<p>M-E-R. Okay.</p>
<p>R-U-P-E-R-T.</p>
<p>You're almost there. Good.</p>
<p>♪ Well, shake it up, baby ♪</p>
<p>[ Screaming ]</p>
<p>♪ Shake it up, baby Twist and shout, Twist and shout ♪<br />
♪ [ Continues, Indistinct]</p>
<p>[ Laughing, Gurgling ]</p>
<p>I first knew the show was a hit when I walked into school... and a kid was wearing a Bart Simpson T-shirt.</p>
<p>Fox had an endless supply of clever slogans, man.</p>
<p>Suddenly I was invited to every birthday party.</p>
<p>Sometimes I'd have to read the cake just to know who I was singing to.</p>
<p>[ Narrator] The Simpsons was a smash.</p>
<p>Viewers couldn't get enough of the show's fractured take on the modern family.</p>
<p>The funniest stuff came right out of real life.</p>
<p>Son, let's go out for frosty chocolate milk shakes.</p>
<p>Cowabunga, dude!</p>
<p>And... cut!</p>
<p>Dad, I've never said &quot;Cowabunga&quot; in my life. Your script sucks.</p>
<p>Why, you little- [ Sputtering ]</p>
<p>[ Choking ]</p>
<p>Hey, that's funny.</p>
<p>[ Crew Laughing]</p>
<p>[ Sputtering ]</p>
<p>[ Choking ]</p>
<p>[Laughing Continues ]</p>
<p>And that horrible act of child abuse... became one of our most beloved running gags.</p>
<p>[Narrator] With Simpson merchandise selling like crazy... and Simpson Gin wetting whistles worldwide, the money was pouring in.</p>
<p>[ All Laughing ]</p>
<p>[ Both Growling ]</p>
<p>We were using $50 bills as toilet paper... and toilet paper as dog toilet paper.</p>
<p>[ All Laughing ]</p>
<p>Mmm. Ah.</p>
<p>[Narrator] Convinced that the good times would never stop rolling... the Simpsons moved out of their trademark house and into M.C. Hammer's.</p>
<p>[ Grunting ] Mm.</p>
<p>We found a secret room that was filled to the ceiling with parachute pants.</p>
<p>I'm wearing some now.</p>
<p>♪ [ Vocalizing ]</p>
<p>[ Exhales ]</p>
<p>[Narrator] But pants or no pants... the Simpsons were flying high.</p>
<p>Yeah, I've seen all the overnight sensations-</p>
<p>Brad Hall, Rich Hall, Rich Little, Little Richard- but the Simpsons blew 'em all away.</p>
<p>They even had a hit record.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Krustophenia sits on the shelf.</p>
<p>None of us had ever sung before, but Mr. Geffen believed in us.</p>
<p>♪ We're gonna groove tonight ♪<br />
♪ We'll make you feel all right ♪<br />
♪ Simpsons boogie ♪</p>
<p>[Narrator] Simpsons Boogie...</p>
<p>Lovely to Love Your Lovin'... and Simpsons Christmas Boogie went mega-platinum and swept the Grammys.</p>
<p>Right. And the award for Best Hard-core Thrash Metal goes to...</p>
<p>Simpsons Christmas Boogie?</p>
<p>♪ Simpsons Christmas Boogie ♪</p>
<p>[ Gags, Spits ]</p>
<p>[ Narrator] For America's favorite family, everything was coming up roses.</p>
<p>But those roses contained ready-to-sting bees.</p>
<p>[ Buzzing ]</p>
<p>When we come back-</p>
<p>I want to set the record straight.</p>
<p>I thought the cop was a prostitute.</p>
<p>[ Narrator] When Behind the Laughter continues.</p>
<p>♪ [ Rock]</p>
<p>♪ [Rock]</p>
<p>[Narrator] Byte end of their first season... the Simpsons were burning up Nielsen boxes in the U.S... and creating a sensation overseas.</p>
<p>Hello, Mr. Lobster! D'oh! [ Screams ]</p>
<p>[ Spits, Laughing ]</p>
<p>Oh, dear! [ Laughing ]</p>
<p>[ Narrator] Bathtubs of money, wheel barrows of awards... fire hoses of respect- the Simpsons had it all.</p>
<p>[ Cheering ]</p>
<p>[ Groaning ]</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>[ Narrator] But behind the streamers and confetti... storm clouds were gathering.</p>
<p>[ Thunderclap ]</p>
<p>Figurative storm clouds.</p>
<p>Oh, Homer was spending money like a... teenage Arab. [ Chuckles ]</p>
<p>He bought me a Rolex and cashmere jeans.</p>
<p>I felt kinda guilty 'cause I was always tryin' to score with his wife.</p>
<p>So when do we start filming?. Oh.</p>
<p>Even Bart was throwin' dough around.</p>
<p>He paid me and Carl a thousand bucks to kiss each other.</p>
<p>Hey, did we ever get that money?.</p>
<p>[typing]</p>
<p>[typing]</p>
<p>[Narrator] But reckless spending and interracial homoeroticism... were just volume one of The Encyclopedia Self-Destructica.</p>
<p>Even more harrowing were the events of one April afternoon.</p>
<p>[Jingling ]</p>
<p>The script originally called for me to jump the gorge.</p>
<p>But I'd been up all night paying people to kiss, so Dad volunteered to do the stunt.</p>
<p>Everything was going great at first.</p>
<p>I felt like I was king of the world.</p>
<p>I'm king of the world! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p>Right about here I realize something's wrong.</p>
<p>[Screaming]</p>
<p>Yep. There I go. [ Grunting ] then came the rocks-jagged rocks, hitting me with their jags.</p>
<p>[ Groaning ]</p>
<p>[ Narrator] the sequence became an instant comedy classic.</p>
<p>But what the audience didn't see was the unfunny aftermath.</p>
<p>[ Screaming ]</p>
<p>[ Sputtering, Gulps ] Mmm.</p>
<p>[ Narrator] Somehow, Homer became addicted to k*ll.</p>
<p>It was the only way he could perform... the bone-cracking physical comedy...</p>
<p>Ow! My leg! that made him a star.</p>
<p>This is the worst pain ever!</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>Stop pummeling me!</p>
<p>It's really painful!</p>
<p>[ Screaming ]</p>
<p>Why did I take such punishment?. Let's just say that fame was like a drug.</p>
<p>[Whistling, Screaming ]</p>
<p>But what was even more like a drug was the drugs.</p>
<p>[Narrator] But despite their mounting problems... the Simpsons' star continued to rise, like a plastic bag caught in an updraft.</p>
<p>[ Lisa Narrating] It was such an honor to be on the Walk of Fame.</p>
<p>I mean, there we were with Hollywood royalty like Milton Berle and Nelson Mandela.</p>
<p>And just a few stars down from the Cheerios honeybee.</p>
<p>Awards and honors are great, but they don't pay the pickle man.</p>
<p>We were earning millions, but we were always strapped for cash.</p>
<p>One time, Lisa bought a first edition of Susan B. Anthony Man.</p>
<p>Her check bounced higher than Rubber Girl.</p>
<p>[ Narrator] Where did the money go?</p>
<p>Marge lost much of the family fortune investing in birth control products.</p>
<p>I learned something. When people reach for their diaphragm... they don't want to see my picture.</p>
<p>[ Narrator]As the Simpsons' money dwindled, their expenses soared.</p>
<p>From the original group of five, the cast ballooned to dozens... then hundreds.</p>
<p>I 'd never acted before in my life, but, uh... if the sea captain could be in the show, why not me?</p>
<p>I 've even got a catchphrase. Nyah! Whaa!</p>
<p>Whaa, whaa, whaa! Now I lost it.</p>
<p>[ Narrator] then, another b*mb.</p>
<p>An anonymous tipster alerted Uncle Sam... that the Simpsons were evading their income taxes.</p>
<p>[ Apu's Voice ] Yes, I finked on Homer, but, you know, he deserved it.</p>
<p>Never have I seen such abuse of the &quot;Take a penny, leave a penny&quot; tray.</p>
<p>[ Narrator] the tax men were merciless.</p>

<p>I 'm... an impostor.</p>
<p>That man is the real Seymour Skinner.</p>
<p>[ Crowd Gasps ]</p>

<p>After judging a Miss Hawaiian tropic beauty contest... at the Sheraton Hali'a Kalua Lea...</p>
<p>Bart created a ruckus on a Hawaiian Airline jet... [ Camera Shutters Clicking ] attacking several flight attendants.</p>
<p>While he was in rehab, the part of Bart Simpson was played... by his good friend Richie Rich.</p>
<p>Bart, what do you mean you have jury duty?.</p>
<p>Don't have a cow, Mother.</p>

<p>[ Man Yawns ]</p>
<p>Angry yawns.</p>
<p>[Angry Yawn ]</p>
<p>Desperate to polish their tarnished image, the family agreed... to a live appearance at the lowa State Fair.</p>
<p>Right from the start I had a bad feeling about that gig.</p>

<p>Yeah, forget the doughnuts. We're here to go nuts.</p>
<p>Musically, that is.</p>
<p>What kind of song should we play?.</p>

<p>After the state fair fiasco, none of the family were speaking to each other.</p>

<p>In that family, nobody trusted nobody.</p>
<p>They even brought their lawyers to Thanksgiving dinner.</p>

<p>Well, I'll be honest. The New Awareness Awards are all an elaborate sham.</p>
<p>What?. [ Sputters ] I knew it was too good to be true.</p>
<p>So this whole thing was just a trick to get us back together?.</p>
<p>Well, I'm also trying to patch things up between Van Halen and Sammy Hagar.</p>
