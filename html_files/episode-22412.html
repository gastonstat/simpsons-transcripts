Brick Like Me<br />
Original Air Date on May 4, 2014</p>
<p>(snoring)</p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: Homie! Homie, wake up!</p>
<p>You're having a nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: It's not selling out.</p>
<p>It's co-branding.</p>
<p>Co-branding!</p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: Wake up!</p>
<p>(Homer grunting)</p>
<p>Oh, honey, the best part of every day is waking up to your smiling face.</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>Just like the best day of my life was when you (pop) gave me your hand in marriage.</p>
<p>Ooh. (chuckles)</p>
<p>I'd like it back, please.</p>
<p>(barks)</p>
<p>Hey! Drop it, you stupid dog!</p>
<p>That's one of my wife's pieces!</p>
<p>She needs it to reciprocate high fives!</p>
<p>(Homer grunting)</p>
<p>That's okay, Homie.</p>
<p>I'll just grab another.</p>
<p>Mmm...</p>
<p>Oh... I haven't worn this one since New Year's.</p>
<p>(sizzling)</p>
<p>Hmm. Is it just me, or does something seem... weird today?</p>
<p>You're right-- something <em>is</em> different about the Simpsons today.</p>
<p>Your father's wearing a <em>tie.</em></p>
<p>Oh, <em>that's</em> what's different!</p>
<p>That's the one and only thing.</p>
<p>Maggie! Stop that!</p>
<p>No more playing with your food.</p>
<p>Aw, they're so cute when they're Duplo.</p>
<p>Uh, yes, is this a toy store?</p>
<p>Uh-huh. I'm supposed to get my daughter a birthday present-- hmm, what's it called?</p>
<p>Here it is.</p>
<p>Perky Patty's Princess Shop.</p>
<p>(grunts)</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>Oh! I'm so sorry-- but I have an awesome excuse: I was distracted driving.</p>
<p>Oh, don't worry about it.</p>
<p>(chuckles): Good thing we don't feel pain.</p>
<p>Hey! These are the monkey's legs!</p>
<p>(whimpers)</p>
<p>(panicked chattering)</p>
<p>Come back!</p>
<p>I'm a clown!</p>
<p>I can't afford to look ridiculous!</p>
<p>(school bell ringing)</p>
<p>Hey, Bart, check out what I brought for share day.</p>
<p><strong>Bart</strong>: Whoa! A skunk!</p>
<p>Who should we stink first?</p>
<p>It can't spray-- it's been de-sacked.</p>
<p>Ew!</p>
<p>The gypsy skunk-seller lied!</p>
<p>(panicked yelling)</p>
<p>He went in there!</p>
<p>Stop it! If you pull out those bricks, the whole school could collapse!</p>
<p>But there's a skunk in there.</p>
<p>(gasps) Scottish steak!</p>
<p>(students groaning)</p>
<p>(both gasp)</p>
<p>You are going to rebuild every brick of this school.</p>
<p>This says: ages 12 and up.</p>
<p>Age guidelines are conservative, and everyone knows it.</p>
<p>And to motivate you, some words of support from the school chum.</p>
<p>Haw-haw!</p>
<p><strong>Skinner</strong>: Thank you, Nelson.</p>
<p>(Homer humming)</p>
<p>One Perky Patty's Princess Shop, please.</p>
<p>Ah. Always good to meet a fellow AMFOP.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Adult Male Fan of Princesses.</p>
<p>It's for my daughter.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, it's always for the daughter.</p>
<p>Well, that's weird.</p>
<p>I feel like I've seen this toy before.</p>
<p>(rumbling)</p>
<p>Do you like it, honey?</p>
<p>I love it, Dad!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Well, have fun putting it together.</p>
<p>Wait, wha... Dad, don't you want to build it <em>with</em> me?</p>
<p>Well, there's no dad on the box.</p>
<p>I don't want to get in trouble.</p>
<p>(laughs): Of course I do!</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Well, what do you know?</p>
<p>I <em>enjoyed</em> playing with you.</p>
<p>Me, too, Dad.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Listen to me.</p>
<p>We played... and it wasn't boring.</p>
<p>We've played lots of times.</p>
<p>Of course we have!</p>
<p>Because you're my girl and I love you.</p>
<p>But I'm letting you in on a secret.</p>
<p>When parents play with their kids, they don't like it.</p>
<p>And I'm no different.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Suddenly I can't breathe.</p>
<p>Every fiber of my being screams out for a nap.</p>
<p>And if someone handed me an issue of <em>The New Yorker,</em></p>
<p>(chuckles): I would read the fiction.</p>
<p>I swear to God I would.</p>
<p>Wow. But there are millions of parents in the world.</p>
<p>Surely some of them like playing with...</p>
<p>Nope, not even one.</p>
<p>Just look at the things you kids like: tea parties with pretend food; hide-and-seek with <em>flagrant</em> peeking; and the most inhumane torture ever devised by man...</p>
<p>(shudders)</p>
<p>Candy Land.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>But this... this is tolerable!</p>
<p>(gasping breaths)</p>
<p>What a crazy vision.</p>
<p>I was in a world where nothing is made of bricks, except for toys!</p>
<p>Hey, read the sign.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>(whimpering)</p>
<p><em>Marge, I'm telling you,</em> it was so weird.</p>
<p>My body was squishy, and my hands looked like snakes made of meat!</p>
<p>It was horrible!</p>
<p>Oh, Homie, it was probably just a mini-stroke.</p>
<p>You're just saying that to make me feel better.</p>
<p>Whatever you saw, it wasn't real.</p>
<p>That's how the world works.</p>
<p>Everything fits with everything else, and nobody ever gets hurt.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Oh, maybe you just need someone to... you know, take your mind off it?</p>
<p>Hm?</p>
<p>I always need that.</p>
<p>I only don't ask because being rejected...</p>
<p>(breathily): gets old.</p>
<p>(Homer and Marge sigh)</p>
<p>Oh, baby, I feel so close to you right now.</p>
<p>(whistling a tune)</p>
<p>(clinking)</p>
<p>(shrieks)</p>
<p>Hmm? Hmm?</p>
<p>Marge? Did you replace our regular mirror with a magical mirror from a mystical salesman at a weird store that if we went back to find it, it wouldn't be there anymore?</p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: No. (screams)</p>
<p>Okay, Homer, get a grip.</p>
<p>I'm sure lots of people, every time they look in the mirror, see a hideous flesh monster.</p>
<p>Just a one-time thing.</p>
<p>(gasps) Oh, brick me!</p>
<p>Leave me alone!</p>
<p>Why don't you go back where you came from!</p>
<p>I have as much right to be here as you!</p>
<p>I, sir, am in the Advent calendar!</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>Apu</strong>: December 18, final week! Huh?</p>
<p>Moe, I'm going crazy-- I need to k*ll off as many of my brain cells as possible.</p>
<p>Well, I'm here to help.</p>
<p>(clinking)</p>
<p>(sputters)</p>
<p>What the...?</p>
<p>This isn't beer.</p>
<p>Beer is plastic circles.</p>
<p>How can I drink... (shudders) this?</p>
<p>(mug shatters)</p>
<p>Did you guys see... that?</p>
<p>Oh, it's getting worse!</p>
<p>(shrieks)</p>
<p>(grumbling)</p>
<p>Ugh! Rebuilding the same boring old school.</p>
<p>I could make this place so much cooler if they just gave me a chance.</p>
<p>(yawns)</p>
<p>(snoring)</p>
<p>(sneaky chuckling)</p>
<p>(gasps) What have you done to my school?</p>
<p>I put in a rock-climbing wall, all the classrooms are skate parks, we got zip-line stairwells, Terminator gym teachers, your office is now a haunted forest-- extra ghosts-- and, if you can believe it, two tetherball poles.</p>
<p>How will children learn if they don't feel like they're in kid jail?</p>
<p>Relax. I used all the same bricks.</p>
<p>Plus Ralph.</p>
<p><em>Yo soy</em> language lab.</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>But I don't want to go to church--</p>
<p>I'm too busy going crazy.</p>
<p>Come on, Homie.</p>
<p>When I'm troubled, I always find solace in the airtight logic of religion.</p>
<p>&quot;Before the world began, there was only table. Then the Great Constructor scissored open bag one and dumped out the universe. Then came the time of the Great Sorting: color to color, shape to shape, and a pile of just windows and doors. And everything was made of eternal, unchanging acrylonitrile butadiene styrene,&quot; or in the common tongue, &quot;plastic.&quot;</p>
<p>But, Reverend, what if everything <em>isn't</em> made of plastic?</p>
<p>I think there's more to this world.</p>
<p>You mean like decals?</p>
<p>Well, the Orthodox don't use them, but we're a Reform congregation.</p>
<p>No. I mean a place where nothing snaps together and you just can't toss your kids in a dishwasher to clean 'em.</p>
<p>(chuckles): Oh, Homer, a place like that could only exist in some kind of magic rock song.</p>
<p>Look around-- we live in a perfect world where everything fits together and no one gets hurt.</p>
<p>Mustache is right.</p>
<p>(others agreeing)</p>
<p>But I'm having all these hallucinations.</p>
<p>Like right now my hands look like they're these weird wiggly things.</p>
<p>I think they have a name, but I can't put my finger on it.</p>
<p>(congregation gasps)</p>
<p>Don't look, boys!</p>
<p>(pop)</p>
<p>Wait! You guys see them, too?</p>
<p>He's a freak!</p>
<p>Take him apart and lose the pieces under the couch!</p>
<p>Well, I don't find him disgusting.</p>
<p>Oh, boy, that's mushy!</p>
<p>Come on, Marge.</p>
<p>We need real answers, and there's only one place we can get them!</p>
<p>Let's see, &quot;fingers.&quot;</p>
<p>Come on, show me something about fingers.</p>
<p>(sighs) Bad news, people.</p>
<p>Our religion is not true.</p>
<p>Sorry about that.</p>
<p>Really sorry.</p>
<p>If I'm right, when I touch this box, it'll trigger another memory from some alternate me's life.</p>
<p>If I don't come back from that other place, tell my wife I loved her.</p>
<p>I'm right here.</p>
<p>Promise me!</p>

<p>(rumbling)</p>
<p>I can't believe all the time I wasted playing with Bart when I could have been playing with you.</p>
<p>Aw...</p>
<p>Our little Springfield is really turning out great.</p>
<p>City Hall, the weird-smelling bank, Rehab World...</p>
<p>Krustyburger, Krustyburger Express, the Krustyburger where the governor got stabbed...</p>
<p>Oh, you two.</p>
<p>Hey, look what I found in the &quot;Arts-Weekend-Obituary&quot; section of the paper.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa (gasps)</strong>: A builders competition!</p>
<p>We got to enter our mini-Springfield.</p>
<p>We're a great team!</p>
<p>We're there.</p>
<p>I'll clear my calendar.</p>
<p>Hey, Lenny, remember those two surfers we were gonna fight?</p>
<p>Well, you're on your own.</p>
<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: <em>But you're the one who sat on their fish tacos.</em></p>
<p>Great talking to you, buddy.</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>Lisa, Lisa, I spent all day at work making a Duff brewery for our mini-Springfield.</p>
<p>I don't want to brag, but... it really brews.</p>
<p>Huh? Where is she?</p>
<p>Okay, I got us tickets for the 7:30 show of <em>Survival Games.</em></p>
<p>I've never been to a PG-13 movie before.</p>
<p>I wonder what the one swear word will be.</p>
<p>What if it's...</p>
<p>(whispering)</p>
<p>(gasps) Oh, I've never heard that one.</p>
<p>My grampa said it at Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>We usually don't hang out with second graders, but we saw your <em>Survival Games</em> book report hanging in the hallway, and we were very impressed.</p>
<p>You really understood that the theme of the book was love.</p>
<p>Hey, older girls, I'm Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>That's right. Lisa's playtime partner and BFF.</p>
<p>(girls groaning)</p>
<p>I assume Lisa told you about the pretend tiny town she's building with her overweight father.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, it's gonna be mucho fresh.</p>
<p>Come on, honey.</p>
<p>It's time to click some bricks.</p>
<p>I don't know what he's doing up here.</p>
<p>He usually stays in the basement.</p>
<p>It's okay, Lisa.</p>
<p>We have dads, too.</p>
<p>I have three dads.</p>
<p>See you Friday.</p>
<p>Friday? But that's when Brick-Stock is.</p>
<p>Um, actually, Friday is the opening night of the new <em>Survival Games</em> movie, and they invited me.</p>
<p>But this was <em>our</em> thing.</p>
<p>I know. I'm sorry, but cool older girls have never wanted to hang out with me before.</p>
<p>One of them wears deodorant.</p>
<p>I don't know which one.</p>
<p>Oh. All right.</p>
<p>Thanks for understanding, Dad.</p>
<p>What just happened?</p>
<p>It's not you.</p>
<p>Lisa's growing up.</p>
<p>It's a really complicated time in a girl's life from age eight to... actually, all the rest of the way.</p>
<p>Oh! I finally found something I like doing with my daughter, and now I've lost it.</p>
<p>I don't fit into her world.</p>
<p>This is for the tacos!</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>Tacos, brah! Ow!</p>
<p>What did you build?</p>
<p>Mmm...</p>
<p>Oh, that's the teenage crossbow ace who stole my daughter from me.</p>
<p>Keendah Wildwill is a modern feminist hero-- strong, independent and resourceful.</p>
<p>She's a little... bustier than I remember.</p>
<p>My work on that front is never done.</p>
<p>I wish I lived in little Springfield.</p>
<p>Everything fits together, and no one ever gets hurt.</p>
<p>(yells)</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p><strong>Comic book guy</strong>: <em>Okay...</em></p>
<p>Apparently, our whole world is a fantasy in the mind of an emotionally-devastated Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>One of the main questions I have about that is, why?</p>
<p>The real Homer fears losing his daughter's love, so he invented this toy world where nothing will ever change.</p>
<p>How can you be sure?</p>
<p>I have devoted my life to second-rate science fiction.</p>
<p>Trust me, that is what we are dealing with here.</p>
<p>So if I don't find my way out of here, I could be trapped in a fantasy forever?</p>
<p>I'm afraid so.</p>
<p>(whooping)</p>
<p>I'm trapped in a fantasy forever!</p>
<p>Kiss my flat plastic butt, reality.</p>
<p>(giggling)</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Daddy-daughter time will never end!</p>
<p>Inventing this toy world to live in is the smartest thing my brain-damaged brain ever did.</p>
<p>Nothing bad can ever happen here.</p>
<p>Great throw, Homer.</p>
<p>Put it in Tupperware, boys.</p>
<p>We'll rebuild it tomorrow.</p>
<p>Homie, ask yourself-- can you really live in a paradise if you know it's just pretend?</p>
<p>Marge, who would give up eating steak in the Matrix to go slurp goo in Zion?</p>
<p>We don't have that movie here.</p>
<p>Now Lisa can never ditch me, and I can play with her forever.</p>
<p>(sighs)</p>
<p>There, I finished.</p>
<p>All 12 of them.</p>
<p>I'll never build what I want again.</p>
<p>Then you've learned your lesson.</p>
<p>Too bad I got these for my birthday.</p>
<p>They always give me the school.</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>Sparkle Unicorn, would like some more tea?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, hook me up with some more of that imaginary nectar.</p>
<p>I've never seen you throw yourself into a tea party like this.</p>
<p>Before, it always seemed like you were kind of phoning it in.</p>
<p>Not anymore, Lisa.</p>
<p>I've created a perfect world with no PG-13 movies to take you away from me.</p>
<p>(sips loudly)</p>
<p>Ah! 'Cause in a toy town, everything stays shiny and wonderful, just the way I want it.</p>
<p>You'll always be my little girl.</p>
<p>Maggie will always be my giant baby.</p>
<p>Bart will never move out of the house.</p>
<p>I'll work for Mr. Burns forever.</p>
<p>Marge and I will never grow old together and live like fat cats on Social Security.</p>
<p>Good Lord, I'll never experience the ultimate reward for a life well lived-- the gentle slumber of death.</p>
<p>Marge, I made a terrible mistake!</p>
<p>The fact that kids grow up is what makes time with them special.</p>
<p>I think I need to go back.</p>
<p>I wish you'd told me that before I bought all these groceries.</p>
<p>But I understand.</p>
<p>Lego Marge, you're just as cool as Real Marge.</p>
<p>Who?!</p>
<p>Nobody, nobody.</p>
<p>Plastic Comic Book Guy, I need to go back home.</p>
<p>Home? But you've discovered the joy of living in a world made of toys where nothing bad can ever happen.</p>
<p>But I miss burning my mouth on pizza, and David Blaine stunts where he could really die.</p>
<p>Now tell me how to get out of here!</p>
<p>All you need to do is open the box back to your so-called reality.</p>
<p>But I can't let that happen.</p>
<p>Huh? You're the bad guy?</p>
<p>I thought you were the rule-explainer guy.</p>
<p>As an adult who surrounds himself with child's toys, I represent the part of your psyche that prefers <em>this</em> artificial world.</p>
<p>(rhythmic clicking, gate clangs shut)</p>
<p>How did you do that?!</p>
<p>Because, as the ultimate collector, I have every play set ever made.</p>
<p>(creaking) Huh?</p>
<p>(gasps) Pirates!</p>
<p>(whooshing, grunting)</p>
<p>Pajama guys!</p>
<p>(gasps) I'll never get home.</p>
<p>Who could build something awesome enough to save me?</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p><em>Who?! Who?!</em></p>
<p>Don't you even think about it.</p>
<p>(whirring)</p>
<p>You are thinking about it, aren't you?</p>
<p>(whimpering)</p>
<p>(loud, rhythmic thudding)</p>
<p>You are going back where you came from--</p>
<p>Denmark.</p>
<p>What is that thing?</p>
<p>I have no idea, but it's gonna kick his butt.</p>
<p>That robot is made out of Batmobile, Hobbit hole and SpongeBob play sets.</p>
<p>That's... that's mis-set-genation.</p>
<p>(in robotic voice): Kid power.</p>
<p><strong>Bart</strong>: Lion blast!</p>
<p>(whirring, rapid g*n)</p>
<p>Lightsaber barf!</p>
<p>(click, whirring, whooshing)</p>
<p>Fire Principal!</p>
<p>This is strangely exhilarating.</p>
<p>No. No.</p>
<p>(crying): No!</p>
<p>I am going to enjoy playing with this thing forever!</p>
<p>(Bart grunting)</p>
<p>I'm a creative but undisciplined builder!</p>
<p>(Homer grunts, Comic Book Guy groans)</p>
<p>(anxious whimpering)</p>
<p>(magical whirring)</p>
<p>Good-bye, Homie.</p>
<p>Your squishy meat family is lucky to have a good man like you.</p>
<p>Oh, baby, no matter what the reality, you're the best thing in it.</p>
<p>Hmm. That was a little weird, right?</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>(whirring)</p>
<p>(yelling)</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: Dad, wake up.</p>
<p>Wake up.</p>
<p>Oh, Meat Lisa, it's you.</p>
<p>Are you okay?</p>
<p>Oh, I had this crazy dream where I was in a world made of Lego bricks and learned important lessons about parenting.</p>
<p>Mmm, isn't that kind of the plot of the...?</p>
<p>No. No, it's not.</p>
<p>It's a <em>new</em> plot.</p>
<p>Honey, what are you doing here?</p>
<p>I thought you were going to your movie.</p>
<p>I changed my mind.</p>
<p>I knew how much this meant to you.</p>
<p>No, no, go to the movie with your friends.</p>
<p>If there's one thing I've learned, it's that I can't stop you from growing up.</p>
<p>I love you, Dad.</p>
<p>Me, too, little girl.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>Thayson, Joshuel, don't make me pick between you two on the night before I reenter the Struggle Dome again.</p>
<p>We'll never stop loving you, even if you string us along forever.</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p>How can I choose between two boys, one who's dangerous but good-looking, the other who's strong but super cute?</p>
<p><strong>All (sighing)</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p>Oh, my God, this is terrible.</p>
<p>When do they get to k*ll the children?</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
<p>Wait a second.</p>
<p>You're not into this...</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
<p>She's trying on dresses.</p>
<p>Oh, I just wanted to see kids fight to the death, is all.</p>
<p>Shh...!</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
