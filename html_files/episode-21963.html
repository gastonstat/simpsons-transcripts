<p>[ Groans ] We don't think you're slow... but on the other hand, it's not like you go to museums or read books or anything.</p>

<p>I think it's great you're a teacher, Dad.</p>

<p>[ Screeches ]</p>
<p>Earth base, this is Commander Bart McCool.</p>
<p>We are under attack by the Zorrinid brain changers.</p>
<p>Quickly, into the safety dome, Milbot.</p>
<p>[ In Monotone ] Affirmative, humanoid.</p>
<p>[ Both ] Ew!</p>
<p>Don't mind me, boys. Just scrubbin' my undies.</p>
<p>Sorry, Bart. Your dad kinda blew the fantasy.</p>
<p>I only like it when I'm pretend-scared.</p>
<p>Keep up the roughhousing, Son.</p>
<p>Without a strong male presence in the house, you could turn sissy overnight.</p>
<p>Oh, these stubborn grass stains.</p>
<p>Oh, good. Reverend Lovejoy will make Marge take me back.</p>
<p>He has to push the sanctity of marriage, or his god will punish him.</p>
<p>Get a divorce.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>But isn't that a sin?</p>
<p>Marge,just about everything is a sin.</p>
<p>You ever sat down and read this thing?</p>
<p>Technically, we're not allowed to go go the bathroom.</p>
<p>[ Sighs ]</p>
<p>[ Moans Softly ]</p>
<p>Good night, Marge. [ Kisses ]</p>
<p>Oh, why didn't I take a picture?</p>
<p>I had ten years to take a picture.</p>
<p>Hmm. Funny the way everything reminds me of Homer.</p>
<p>[ Homer's Voice ] I love you.</p>
<p>Will you marry me, Marge?</p>
<p>You mean, I'm gonna be a daddy?</p>
<p>I hope we'll always be together, together, together--</p>
<p>Together?</p>
<p>[ Tires Screech ]</p>
<p>[ Screams, Grunting ] Ooh.</p>
<p>Here, Dad. I brought you some nice-- [ Yelps ]</p>
<p>Good news, Lisa. I don't need your mother anymore.</p>
<p>I've created a replacement that's superior to her in almost every way.</p>
<p>Dad, that's just a plant.</p>
<p>Lisa! You will respect your new mother. Now, give her a kiss.</p>
<p>Kiss her! [ Yelps ]</p>
<p>Oh-my-God! Oh-my-God! Oh-my-God! [ Panting ]</p>
<p>All right. Let's get our stories straight.</p>
<p>She tripped, right?</p>
<p>Look. I brought you some nice pudding.</p>
<p>Ah, your flesh mother used to bring me pudding.</p>
<p>Oh, I miss Marge.</p>
<p>Lisa, you're smart. Help me trick her into taking me back.</p>
<p>Dad, you can't trick somebody into loving you.</p>
<p>There's a reason two people come together and stay together.</p>
<p>There's something they give each other that nobody else can give them.</p>
<p>If you want Mom back, you just have to remember what you give her that nobody else can.</p>
<p>I'll pay you $40 if you think of it for me.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay. 30.</p>
<p>Good luck, Dad.</p>
<p>All right, brain. It's all up to you.</p>
<p>If you don't think of what it is, we'll lose Marge forever.</p>
<p>[ Thinking, Rapidly ] Eat the pudding. Eat the pudding--</p>
<p>Eat the pudding. Eat the pudding-- [ Continues ]</p>
<p>Okay, but then we gotta get to work.</p>
<p>[ Eating Loudly ]</p>
<p>[ Moans Softly ]</p>
<p>[ Doorbell Chimes ]</p>
<p>[ Exhales ]</p>
<p>[ Clears Throat ] Oh. H-Hi, Marge.</p>
<p>I heard you and Homer broke up, so I'm declarin' my intentions to move in on his territory.</p>
<p>Here, I, uh, brung ya some posies.</p>
<p>Oh, my.</p>
<p>I'm very flattered, but I'm not really interested.</p>
<p>Sheesh. I come here, I get dressed up all nice-like... put my heart on the line, and I make a fool of myself.</p>
<p>Oh, boy. Oh, I'm gonna start bawlin' here.</p>
<p>Hmm, why don't you come inside for a drink of water?</p>
<p>'Kay.</p>
<p>Hmm. Clean house, no silverfish.</p>
<p>Could've been very happy here.</p>
<p>[ Knocking ]</p>
<p>Homer.</p>
<p>Moe.</p>
<p>What are you doin' here?</p>
<p>I, um-- Well, I--</p>
<p>I never touched her. Homer, I swear, I never touched her.</p>
<p>Here's your water, Moe.</p>
<p>I didn't ask her for no water. She's lyin', Homer. She told me you were dead.</p>
<p>That's the only reason I-- I didn't do nothin'!</p>
<p>[ Glass Breaking ]</p>
<p>[ Screams ]</p>
<p>Bye, Moe.</p>
<p>Homer, what happened to you?</p>
<p>Marge, I figured out what I can give you that no one else can: a bouquet of po-- ohhh.</p>
<p>I give up. I don't deserve to live with you.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>[ Table Bumps Against Wall ]</p>
<p>Oh. My tattered rags... are caught on your coffee table.</p>
<p>Oh, here. Let me help you.</p>
<p>[ Muttering Softy ]</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Wait, that's it.</p>
<p>I know now what I can offer you that no one else can: complete and utter dependence.</p>
<p>Homer, that's not a good thing.</p>
<p>Are you kidding? It's a wondrous, marvelous thing.</p>
<p>Marge, I need you more than anyone else on this entire planet... could possibly ever need you.</p>
<p>I need you to take care of me, to put up with me... and most of all, I need you to love me, because I love you.</p>
<p>[ Sad Grunt ]</p>
<p>But how do I know I can trust you?</p>
<p>Marge, look at me. We've been separated for a day, and I'm as dirty as a Frenchman.</p>
<p>In another few hours I'll be dead. I can't afford to lose your trust again.</p>
<p>[ Sighing ]</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I must admit. You really do make a gal feel needed.</p>
<p>Wait till my class hears about this. Kidding!</p>
<p>[ Sighs ] Oh, it's great to be indoors with my family.</p>
<p>I'm really glad you're back, Dad. I knew you could do it.</p>
<p>Now don't screw it up.</p>
<p>Look, Dad. I missed you so much, I couldn't concentrate in school and I got an &quot;F.&quot;</p>
<p>Hey, this is dated two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Oh. Sorry. Here's a fresh one.</p>
<p>And I have a special present for you, but I'll give it to you later tonight.</p>
<p>Special present? I don't wanna wait. I want it now! I want the children to see.</p>
<p>Ooh. Oh, right.</p>
<p>Later. [ Chuckling ]</p>
<p>So, Marge, are you really happy? Really?</p>
<p>Hey, Moe.</p>
<p>[ Yelps ]</p>
<p>[ People Chattering ]</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
