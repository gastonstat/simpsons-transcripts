<p><strong>Man</strong>: You're better than us!</p>
<p>Homer, that guy's your age?</p>
<p>No, he's ten days younger.</p>
<p>So you're saying he'll look like you in ten days?</p>
<p>If he's lucky.</p>
<p>The guy owns a few local businesses and everyone treats him like he's God!</p>
<p>Well, God doesn't need his own special day.</p>
<p>What about Sunday?</p>
<p>Sunday's the Lord's day, boy. Not God's. Completely different guy.</p>
<p>Your father's just jealous because Vance was our class president in high school.</p>
<p>If I had won class president, I'd be the one getting thrown up in the air right now.</p>
<p>Dad, you ran for class president?</p>
<p>Yep. Back in high school, right before I met your mother.</p>
<p>A simpler time when the only thing we worried about was total nuclear annihilation.</p>

<p>(ALL LAUGHING)</p>
<p>I've never heard a speech so bad. Ten days detention!</p>
<p>No fair!</p>
<p>Anyone who votes for Vance gets a half day tomorrow.</p>
<p>Half day, eh?</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>Don't feel bad, Homie. I married you!</p>
<p>And you're a million times better than...</p>
<p>(GASPS) Here comes Vance!</p>
<p>Hey, Vance!</p>
<p>Thanks for coming out.</p>
<p>Hey, Gail. I love your bangs.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>There they are. My favorite mixed-race couple.</p>
<p>Guys that popular and confident are never truly happy.</p>
<p>He looks happy.</p>
<p>Tears of a clown.</p>
<p>He's not crying. And he's not known for clowning.</p>
<p>Exception that proves the rule. If losers like me know one thing, it's that deep down, winners like him are miserable.</p>
<p>Watch, I'll prove it. Angry nut coming through!</p>
<p>Clear a path, boys.</p>
<p>(HOMER MURMURING ANGRILY)</p>
<p>Hey, Vance.</p>
<p>Hey, Homer Simpson. How you been?</p>
<p>Great. Thanks. Listen, settle a bet. Behind that smile, you're dying, right?</p>
<p>Behind this smile is a bigger smile trying to get out.</p>
<p>Oh! Oh! Here it comes! Oh, yeah!</p>
<p>Please! You gotta have some secret agony!</p>
<p>I bet those fancy shoes hurt your feet.</p>
<p>No. Actually they're like two leather clouds.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Got them from a buddy of mine with a store in Shelbyville.</p>
<p>You want his number?</p>
<p>No. Yes.</p>
<p>Hey, Homer. You want to try my new Vance Connorpolitan?</p>
<p>Like Vance, it is smooth, cool, and oh so sophisticated.</p>
<p>I'll just stick with my beer.</p>
<p>Homer, why are you so down on Vance Connor?</p>
<p>He gave me one of his kidneys.</p>
<p>Yeah, me, too.</p>
<p>Because when Vance b*at me in that election, he ruined my life.</p>
<p>Why did you just exchange that look of guilt?</p>
<p>(SIGHS) Lenny, I think it's time for us to come clean.</p>
<p>(SOFTLY) About how we give each other haircuts?</p>
<p>No. We'll take that secret to our graves. I'm talking about... You know.</p>
<p>(CLEARS THROAT) Right. Listen, Homer.</p>
<p>Something weird happened back in high school.</p>
<p><em>Teenage Carl and I were walking down the hallway when...</em></p>
<p>You two. I want you to take this box and bury it in the woods.</p>
<p>The true results of this election must never be known.</p>
<p>I tell you what. We'll do it under one condition.</p>
<p>Our parents want us to go to college.</p>
<p>But with a bad enough recommendation from you, we can stay here and party.</p>
<p>Okay. But screw this up and it's Carnegie Mellon University for the both of you!</p>
<p>(BOTH GASP)</p>
<p>So there's a chance I actually won. I gotta dig up that ballot box!</p>
<p>Just let it go, Homer.</p>
<p>AI Gore?</p>
<p>Homer, I had a presidential election stolen from me. But I moved on.</p>
<p>And I think you could say everything worked out all right.</p>
<p>Isn't that right, Alfred?</p>
<p>(IN HIGH VOICE) &quot;It sure is, Albert.&quot;</p>
<p>(HOMER MUTTERING)</p>
<p>Ballots stolen. Real winner unknown. What is the truth? I gotta know!</p>
<p>Lenny, wake up!</p>
<p>Finally you return my shovel!</p>
<p>That's not why I'm here. Get dressed!</p>
<p>California casual or business attire?</p>
<p>California casual.</p>
<p>(LENNY GULPS)</p>
<p>(HOMER AND LENNY GRUNTING)</p>
<p>There it is!</p>
<p>The ballot box?</p>
<p>No. This is the box that tells us where the ballot box is.</p>
<p>(LENNY READING)</p>
<p>What will this box reveal?</p>
<p>And what will I use this box for afterwards?</p>
<p>Mismatched nuts and bolts? Recipes? I may never know.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: Vance Connor.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: D'oh!</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: Homer Simpson.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Woo-hoo!</p>
<p>Vance Connor.</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>Woo-hoo!</p>

<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>Woo-hoo!</p>
<p>Please stop doing that.</p>
<p>&quot;D'oh,&quot; or &quot;woo-hoo&quot;?</p>
<p>Both. Homer Simpson, Vance Connor, Fonzie, Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>And the winner is (GASPS) Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>Yes! I'm senior class president!</p>
<p>I get a parking spot if the assistant principal isn't using it!</p>
<p>(HOMER LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Wait a second. If I'd been class president like I was supposed to, I'd be the one with the big mansion, and the color TVs, and the hot wife!</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Marge, I still would be married to you, but you would just be hotter.</p>
<p>Ohhh!</p>
<p>Dad, just 'cause you won a high school election doesn't mean your whole life would've been better.</p>
<p>That's exactly what it means!</p>
<p>And Dondalinger took that life away from me!</p>
<p>And the taking of a life is m*rder! And the punishment for m*rder is...</p>
<p>Well, it varies from state to state and by race, but I'm gonna find Dondalinger and tell him I know what he did last summer, 22 years ago in the winter!</p>
<p>(DONDALINGER CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>That's the thing about you assistant principals.</p>
<p>You can drive the ball but you can't putt.</p>
<p>(ALL LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Wait a minute. You're not in our foursome.</p>
<p>No other foursome would have me. My legs gross people out.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Dondalinger!</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Looks like one of my former students on a quest for truth.</p>
<p>Dondalinger, I should've been class president!</p>
<p>But you stole the election from me!</p>
<p>I can explain. But are you sure we should talk in front of your son?</p>
<p>Yes! I want him to know that if your life doesn't turn out the way you want, there's someone else to blame!</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING) I already knew that, Dad. I'm gonna blame you.</p>
<p>I respect your choice.</p>
<p>Now drive back to the clubhouse and order me a Tom Collins.</p>
<p>With a virgin Tom Collins for me?</p>
<p>(SCOFFS) Virgin. What are you? A girl?</p>
<p>(BART LAUGHS)</p>
<p>Now, Dondalinger, I want some answers.</p>
<p>Very well. It's a fact, I didn't like you, Simpson. Still don't.</p>
<p>You lie. You love me.</p>
<p>Whatever complex emotions I feel, they're not why I did what I did.</p>
<p>There was another reason.</p>

<p>(CHUCKLES) Homer Simpson, what a loser!</p>
<p>Hey, what if we got everyone to vote for him as a joke and he won?</p>
<p>Then we could laugh at him all the way through high school and at every reunion!</p>
<p>Go, sports!</p>
<p>Go, sports!</p>
<p>(BOTH GRUNTING)</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>So you see, I disposed of the ballot box to spare your feelings.</p>
<p>You denied me my dream! So I'm angry!</p>
<p>But you did it out of kindness, so I'm grateful.</p>
<p>I'm filled with respect and contempt for you.</p>
<p>I... Why you...</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>(HOMER GRUNTS ANGRILY)</p>
<p>You are so... I hate you!</p>
<p>As principal, I did a lot of things I'm not proud of.</p>
<p>I would steal school chalk from my own chalkboard.</p>
<p>But I'm not sorry I rigged that election.</p>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna sit under that tree and think of all the women I could've talked to but didn't.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>The brown-haired girl gave me a look.</p>
<p>The red head in the park was reading a book.</p>
<p>The girl at the airport upgraded my car. Tonight, I wonder just where you are.</p>
<p>Homie, you're barely eating.</p>
<p>Yeah. I can actually see your hands. They're not just a blur.</p>
<p>I don't feel much like eating.</p>
<p>I'll never know what would've happened if I had been class president.</p>
<p><strong>Luigi</strong>: (IN ITALIAN ACCENT) You could know if you dared.</p>
<p>Huh? Who said that?</p>
<p>In the kitchen is a man from the old country who works for me.</p>
<p>He stirs the sauce.</p>
<p>They say if he stirs the sauce just right, he can also see what might have been!</p>
<p>As a rational skeptic, I find that hard to believe.</p>
<p>Also as a vegetarian, I hope there's not meat in that sauce.</p>
<p>Any other orders, Mussolini?</p>
<p>No. That's it.</p>
<p>(IN ITALIAN ACCENT) Watch the sauce. You see what I see?</p>
<p>I see a hair.</p>
<p>You see too much!</p>
<p>Now watch the sauce of bubbling red.</p>
<p>And see the life you could've led.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>(COOK GRUNTING)</p>
<p><strong>Cook</strong>: Yes, I like to stir.</p>
<p>Your new senior class president is, (BOY LAUGHS)</p>

<p>(ALL LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Our president's a real loser!</p>
<p>Yeah. A loser like us!</p>

<p>Instead of some idiot spending his Saturday nights staring into a bowl of sauce!</p>
<p>Why did fate do this to me?</p>
<p>Ask the garlic bread.</p>
<p>Why? Why?</p>
<p>Hey, everyone! The stupid fat man's talking to garlic bread!</p>
<p>(COOK LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Come on, stir! I must see more!</p>
<p>Homie, please. Nothing good will come of this.</p>
<p>Marge, unlike CPR, this is something I must know!</p>
<p>Very well. Now we must once more stare madly into the sauce.</p>
<p>Mr. President, we need a class song, a class motto, and a class mascot!</p>
<p><em>Color My World,</em> &quot;Disco Sucks,&quot; and Butthead the goat.</p>
<p>Mr. President, do you approve of the bailout of the French Club?</p>
<p>They're too big to fail.</p>
<p>Homer, do you have a date for the prom yet?</p>
<p>Sorry. The only girl I could ever want is right over there.</p>
<p>Debbie Pinson.</p>
<p>Hey, Debbie. Want to go to prom with me?</p>
<p>Well, I'm engaged to the quarterback, but yes!</p>
<p>Forget it, Marge.</p>
<p>A girl like you could never land a Homer Simpson.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: Aha!</p>
<p>So Dad's life would actually have been worse because he wouldn't have gotten together with Mom, his one true love.</p>
<p>Just keep watching the sauce, girlie.</p>

<p>(HOMER SIGHS)</p>
<p>I got the biggest lapels, the ruffliest shirt, and the most beautiful girl.</p>
<p>Thank you, Homer.</p>
<p>Debbie, I forgot I have an English paper due on Monday.</p>
<p>Would you read <em>To k*ll a Mockingbird</em> for me?</p>
<p>And if you could write down how Boo Radley fits into the southern gothic tradition, that would be great.</p>
<p>Nobody's ever asked me to use my head brain before.</p>

<p>May I have this dance?</p>
<p>Only if it lasts forever.</p>
<p>Homer Simpson! I was gonna let you get to fifth base!</p>
<p>It would've been something you told your grandchildren about!</p>
<p>Sorry, Debbie. I hope you can find happiness without me.</p>
<p>(HOMER HUMMING)</p>
<p>Who wants a cheerleader on the rebound?</p>
<p>I do! Right.</p>
<p>I can hardly believe this is real.</p>
<p>Marge, the way I feel about you is as real and lasting as my hairline.</p>
<p>(EXCLAIMS) Who's that side of beef munching on our sister?</p>
<p>I don't know. But in this reality I am not gay. Hubba hubba!</p>

<p>Thank you, mysterious weirdo.</p>
<p>Tell me, what student government office do you hold? Secretary? Treasurer?</p>
<p>Dare I say secretary-treasurer?</p>
<p>I'm class president.</p>
<p>Hot dog! Say, how would you like to work for me?</p>
<p>Sir, we could start him off in Sector 7G.</p>
<p>7G?</p>
<p>Let the Lennys and the Carls of the world waste their wretched lives in that testicle-shriveling torture chamber.</p>
<p>Son, you'll be working in sector 6F!</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: Aha!</p>
<p>So Dad's life would've been the same!</p>
<p>He would've married Mom and worked for Mr. Burns.</p>
<p>It would've been a push.</p>
<p>Can you keep her quiet?</p>
<p>Not even when she's snorkeling.</p>
<p>I was describing beautiful fish, Bart!</p>
<p>(COOK SIGHS)</p>
<p>(WHISTLING)</p>
<p>How you doing, Dad?</p>
<p>I can't complain. And I never do.</p>
<p>Thanks for letting me live in your guesthouse.</p>
<p>Honey, I'm home!</p>
<p>Where are the kids?</p>
<p>You used protection. We never had any.</p>
<p>Well, that's what's missing. Our lives would be horrible without the kids.</p>
<p>Yes. That must be it. This is the best of all possible worlds!</p>
<p>Blah-blah-blah.</p>
<p>I want to live in the sauce!</p>
<p>If you could live in the sauce, don't you think I would live in the sauce?</p>
<p>(COOK SPEAKING ITALIAN)</p>
<p>(SIGHS)</p>
<p>How long has he been there?</p>
<p>I don't know. But he's algae-fying.</p>
<p>Homie, please come inside?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>(HOMER SIGHS)</p>
<p>Dad, we need to have a talk.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>You're all gonna try to convince me that my life is great just like it is, right?</p>
<p>Are you kidding? We couldn't even convince you that Bruce Wayne is Batman!</p>
<p>Come on! That millionaire playboy?</p>
<p>He's too busy socializing at cocktail parties and managing the affairs of the Wayne Foundation!</p>
<p>Don't open this one again.</p>
<p>(WHISPERING) Why does he think Alfred's friends with Batman?</p>
<p>Just stop!</p>
<p>Dad, we think the sauce had it all wrong.</p>
<p>Look who thinks he's smarter than sauce.</p>
<p>Sweetheart, I think you'd feel better after we take a little walk.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Why would you bring me here?</p>
<p>It's like bringing Richard Nixon to the Watergate, or Kevin Costner to <em>Waterworld.</em></p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>(GASPS) My own plaque!</p>
<p>And one for Vice President Butthead! Cool!</p>
<p>Is that why you brought me here, spirits?</p>
<p>Yep. In the future, people will look at this and they'll say, &quot;Whoever he was, he must've mattered.&quot;</p>
<p>I guess that would be nice.</p>
<p>Pardon me. Can my son have his picture taken with you?</p>
<p>Really? Sure.</p>
<p>Dad, do you think I could be elected class president?</p>
<p>Well, we can't all be Homer Simpson, son.</p>
<p>Thanks, guys.</p>
<p>Hey, was there another plaque here before?</p>
<p>Plaques come, plaques go.</p>
<p>Now let's get something to eat!</p>
<p>How about ltalian?</p>
<p>God, no!</p>
<p>I hear there's a Korean barbecue place where the beef spells out the date of your death.</p>
<p>Whoo! That sounds like fun!</p>
