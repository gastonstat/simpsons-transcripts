<p>It is an honor to be here on land today to recount the inspiring story of this great saint.   </p>

<p>That's a separate event at the Marriott. Conference room C.   </p>
<p>(conch blows)   </p>
<p>In     A.D., Brother Ignatius Castellaneta refused to recant his Christian faith.   </p>
<p>And so the Romans chopped off his head, they chopped off his arms, they chopped off his legs, and they chopped off his toes.   </p>
<p>They sh*t him with arrows made of frozen snakes and they pulled out his eyes and replaced them with chocolate-covered pistachios.   </p>
<p>But still, Ignatius refused to recant.   </p>
<p>So they boiled his bones in sparkling cherry wine.   </p>
<p>So that's why the thrice-martyred saint is remembered with spumoni, the chocolate pistachio cherry ice cream treat.   </p>
<p>(retches) Ugh. Not good.   </p>
<p>Uh, yes, uh, thank you, Super-Fish.   </p>
