<p>(HONKING)</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>(SCREAMS)</p>
<p>(BRAKES SCREECHING)</p>
<p>(BUZZING)</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>(BEEPING)</p>
<p>(Commentator) <em>We got a real nail-biter here at Mile High Stadium.</em></p>
<p>The Broncos down by one, and 30 seconds left on the clock.</p>
<p>Come on, Broncos, you can do it.</p>
<p><em>And I'm joined in the broadcast booth by the stars of ABC's latest reality show</em></p>
<p>Billionaire versus Bear.</p>
<p><em>Let's review the easy-to-follow rules of your show.</p>
<p>Each of you thought you were in a race to plant the Taco Bell flag at the North Pole.</p>
<p>What you didn't know is, the race was a chase spiced up by the presence of the betrayer.</em></p>
<p>(GROANING)</p>
<p><em>Well, now, the bear has a surprise for you.</p>
<p>He's not really a bear, he's a tiger!</p>
<p>Oh, lookie there! Denver just won the ballgame!</em></p>
<p>Oh, the Broncos won?</p>
<p>Why didn't I bet on them like Professor Pigskin told me to?</p>
<p>Who's Professor Pigskin?</p>
<p>He's a pig who can predict football winners in advance!</p>
<p>How is that possible?</p>
<p>Because he's got something no gambler's ever had!</p>
<p>A system!</p>
<p>I've gotten the pamphlet four weeks in a row and every time, the pick-of-the-week has been right on the money.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>Every week, they send out two pamphlets, Half picking one team and half picking the other.</p>
<p>Eventually, there's a small group of people who only receive the correct predictions and think Professor Pigskin is always right.</p>
<p>That's when they ask for your money.</p>
<p>(GASPS) I have money!</p>
<p>Dad, it's a scam!</p>
<p>A scam?</p>
<p>Not according to Eddie F. from Tucson, or Football Millionaire in Beloit, Michigan.</p>
<p>Look, all I'm saying is, you really should think twice before...</p>
<p>Expiration date, 06/08.</p>
<p>Oh, Professor Pigskin told me to bet on the Raiders, but they look awful!</p>
<p><em>And with 37 starting players out with the flu, the Oakland Raiders have turned to drunks conscripted from local bars.</p>
<p>Spare some change, football dude?</em></p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p><em>Now, you have a good day.</em></p>
<p>Dad, how much money did you bet?</p>
<p>Hey, I didn't bet any of our money.</p>
<p>I just borrowed some from him.</p>
<p>Don't worry.</p>
<p>We can hammer out a payment plan.</p>
<p>Ow! (SOBBING)</p>
<p>It's not my fault the Raiders lost!</p>
<p>It's Professor Pigskin's!</p>
<p>If he mentions that pig again, use two hammers.</p>
<p>But the pig...</p>
<p>(SCREAMS) Ow! Ow!</p>
<p>Now, I do have a way we could settle this debt.</p>
<p>We would like to use your home to sh**t an adult film.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's called <em>Lemony Lick-it: A Series of Horny Events.</em></p>
<p>(GASPS) Marge would k*ll me!</p>
<p>Please! There's got to be something else I can do.</p>
<p>Like mow your lawn every week for two weeks.</p>
<p>I can't do it next week. Ow! All right!</p>
<p>You can sh**t your gay adult film at my house.</p>
<p>I didn't say anything about gay.</p>
<p>I thought you guys were the gay mafia. Ow!</p>
<p>Oh, they're sh**ting an adult film at my house tomorrow.</p>
<p>How am I gonna get rid of Marge and the kids?</p>
<p>Well, I got these free tickets to Santa's Village.</p>
<p>I know a guy who turns the dead sleigh horses into jerky and sells it to bars.</p>
<p>Ugh!</p>
<p>Thanks, Moe!</p>
<p>Why would we want to go to Santa's Village?</p>
<p>It's August.</p>
<p>I want to see Santa. He can explain why he gave me a Playstation box with nothing inside but a coloring book.</p>
<p>It got your hopes up, didn't it?</p>
<p>Homer, before I take the kids.</p>
<p>I want you to swear you're not up to something.</p>
<p>I swear.</p>
<p>And I'd also like to know why your hand is in that cast.</p>
<p>Because you look even more beautiful now than the day I married you.</p>
<p>Aw!</p>
<p>(FLIES BUZZING)</p>
<p>Welcome to Santa's Village, where it's Christmas every day.</p>
<p>Closed on Christmas.</p>
<p>Those reindeer look really uncomfortable.</p>
<p>That's because they don't thrive in this environment!</p>
<p>Watcha reading, Santa?</p>
<p>Torn Clancy's <em>Op-center.</em></p>
<p>You don't seem very jolly.</p>
<p>Well, Santa got some bad medical news.</p>
<p>Okay...</p>
<p>Okay...</p>
<p>And, action!</p>
<p>We've been on this spaceship for a hundred years.</p>
<p>When will we ever get to Planet Satisfaction?</p>
<p>Hey, Homer, we... Wow!</p>
<p>Angela Dare! Sultry Stevens!</p>
<p>Yeah, what is this, a reunion of <em>Fahrenheit 9-on-1?</em></p>
<p>Guys! Get out of here!</p>
<p>Homer, how'd you ever get Marge to go along with this?</p>
<p>Look, if you promise never to tell her, I'll let you be in the movie.</p>
<p>We just came over to borrow a board game, but okay.</p>
<p>I've always dreamed of working in an adult film.</p>
<p>I'll run the sound board!</p>
<p>And I'll perform in the sex scenes!</p>
<p>Merry Christmas!</p>
<p>I'm your old pal Frosty the Snowman!</p>
<p>In your dreams.</p>
<p>Frosty!</p>
<p>Where's your magic top hat?</p>
<p>Oh, God, please don't tell Mr. Roselli I lost my hat again!</p>
<p>(WHISTLING)</p>
<p>My Christmas present to myself this year was leaving that place early.</p>
<p>Mom, I got a rash where the reindeer licked me.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>When they put Santa in the ambulance, Why'd they pull the blanket all the way up over his head?</p>
<p>Look, I know this wasn't the greatest outing but your father meant well, so don't let him know that we didn't...</p>
<p>(EXCLAIMS)</p>
<p>Are you guys almost done?</p>
<p>Listen, I got a tattoo of Foghorn Leghorn on my right thigh.</p>
<p>Are we gonna get into any trademark or copyright issues here?</p>
<p>'Cause we could put a Band-Aid on it and say my character just got stabbed.</p>
<p>Relax, three guys'll put their hands on it, okay?</p>
<p>Now, everybody is very much in love.</p>
<p>And, action!</p>
<p>Homer! Is this a snuggle film?</p>
<p>Er...</p>
<p>You're in the wrong house, lady!</p>
<p>How could you allow this?</p>
<p>In the room where we do puzzles!</p>
<p>(GRUNTS) Oh, uh-uh.</p>
<p>Honey, please, just listen to what I have to say.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Lowed the mafia money.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Where are you going? Away from you.</p>
<p>When will you be back? I don't know.</p>
<p>Who's going to watch the kids? You are.</p>
<p>Me? But I'm the father!</p>
<p>(ENGINE REVVING)</p>
<p>Boy, Homer, I've never seen Mom this mad.</p>
<p>Honey, come back! You didn't say bye to the kids!</p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: Bye, Bart.</p>
<p>I love you, Lisa.</p>
<p>Sleep tight, Maggie.</p>
<p>Today's the last day you can eat the yogurt in the fridge.</p>
<p>Well, we better go eat that yogurt.</p>
<p>Kids, I'm sure, your mother will be back soon.</p>
<p>She should be back now. It's dinnertime.</p>
<p>Look, we've been down this road before.</p>
<p>I do something stupid, your mom leaves, we eat waffles.</p>
<p>We're out of waffles. All we got is ketchup.</p>
<p>You mean Homer's famous marinara sauce?</p>
<p>No, I mean ketchup.</p>
<p>Where's your sense of magic and wonder?</p>
<p>Come on, Marge. When are you going to call?</p>
<p>(RINGING)</p>
<p>Let it ring, play hard to get. That's hard enough!</p>
<p>Oh, my darling, I love you! Please forgive me!</p>
<p><strong>Moe</strong>: Hey, Homer. Moe, what are you calling me for?</p>
<p>You told me to call. You wanted to see if your phone was working.</p>
<p>But what if Marge tries to call while I'm talking to you?</p>
<p>Ain't you got call waiting?</p>
<p>Of course, I have call waiting, you idiot!</p>
<p>I just never learned how to use it!</p>
<p>Uh-oh, I might have broken the phone. I better call Moe.</p>
<p>(DIALING)</p>
<p>Oh, hey, Homer. Moe, will you get off the line?</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>I guess I better tell them I'm coming home.</p>
<p>(RINGS)</p>
<p>(STAMMERS)</p>
<p>Oh, Marge, what a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>I'm at a rest stop south of Springfield.</p>
<p>I know. You're sorry now.</p>
<p>Then you'll buy me some Kwik-E-Mart flowers maybe a box of candy, where half the pieces mysteriously have testing bites, and a week later you'll be back to your old thoughtless self.</p>
<p>No, no, it's not going to be like that, I swear.</p>
<p>Ew! Lemon cream. You're going in the Marge pile.</p>
<p>I mean, I love you so much.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love you, too.</p>
<p>(POUNDING AT DOOR)</p>
<p>Hold on. I'll be off in a minute.</p>
<p>(POUNDING CONTINUES)</p>
<p>Listen, buster, I had to buy a club soda I didn't want to get change for this phone.</p>
<p>An oogly-boogly!</p>
<p>(ROARING)</p>
<p>Be still. Don't give it the phone.</p>
<p>Settle down, sugar plum.</p>
<p>Look what daddy's got in his pocket.</p>
<p>Yummy, yummy kelp-</p>
<p>Good girl, yes, yes.</p>
<p>This animal means you no harm.</p>
<p>She's a sweet old Florida manatee, also known as a sea cow or dugong.</p>

<p><strong>Homer</strong>: <em>Hello, Marge, where do we keep the socks that don't smell like feet?</em></p>
<p>I'll call you back.</p>
<p>I'm Dr. Caleb Thorn and I would do anything to protect a manatee except harm another manatee.</p>
<p>What if by harming a manatee you could save two manatees?</p>
<p>But before you answer, consider this.</p>
<p>The manatee you'd have to harm is pregnant.</p>
<p>Those are the questions that keep me up at night.</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>I see a manatee the needs a hug.</p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: <em>Hello, Marge?</p>
<p>Does the pizza guy take a check?</p>
<p>If so, where do we keep the checks?</p>
<p>And lastly, how do you write a check?</em></p>
<p>I think the worst part was when I realized that Homer lied to me.</p>
<p>From what you've told me, it sounds like what your husband did was nothing new.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I have a saying which goes, &quot;You can't teach a manatee any tricks.&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe you could just put a hat on him and say it's a trick.</p>
<p>My point is Homer is the exact same man you married and if there's a problem here, it's that you keep expecting him to change.</p>
<p>Huh!</p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: <em>He cares so much about those doggone dugongs.</p>
<p>I wish I felt that kind of passion.</p>
<p>Maybe I should join him on his mission.</em></p>
<p>Hey, lady blue, while you're sitting there staring at the ceiling your boyfriend's in the parking lot with his hands in a walrus.</p>
<p>Yeah, that'll be good for business.</p>
<p>Got to find your mom. Got to find your mom.</p>
<p><strong>Bart</strong>: Dad, I promise I'll be good.</p>
<p>Can I get out of the dog carrier?</p>
<p>It was hard enough getting you in there. I'm not letting you out.</p>
<p>Yeah, she came through here.</p>
<p>I believe she was looking to rekindle her passion for life.</p>
<p>Ain't that right, Victor? Yes.</p>
<p><em>Señora</em> left for the coast with a rugged, yet sensitive man of science.</p>
<p>Rugged? Is that the same as handsome?</p>
<p>Oh, no, no.</p>
<p>&quot;Handsome&quot; means he look at himself in the mirror all day.</p>
<p>&quot;Rugged&quot; means you look at him.</p>
<p>(SOBBING)</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Okay, water monsters, be friendly... But not too friendly.</p>
<p>What do I do? Talk to it!</p>
<p>Let it know you're not a threat.</p>
<p>Okay. You know, up close, you're kinda cute.</p>
<p>(RETCH ES)</p>
<p>Aw, you're a good thing. I know it.</p>
<p>Let me clean out your ears.</p>
<p>I've bonded with him!</p>
<p>(GIGGLING)</p>
<p>Where is he taking me?</p>
<p>To his underwater palace.</p>
<p>Just kidding. It's a lagoon full of bugs.</p>
<p>(MARGE YELLING)</p>
<p>Dad, I don't think we're gonna find Mom today.</p>
<p>And I'm sick of eating at restaurant chains.</p>
<p>I never even heard of like Skobo's and Dim Willie's.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: Ugh!</p>
<p>Okay, kids, we'll stop for the day.</p>
<p>I have cousins near here. We'll stay with them.</p>
<p>Country cousins? Are they rubes?</p>
<p>'Cause I don't cotton to rubes.</p>
<p>Oh! The rubiest.</p>
<p>Oh, look, a new restaurant chain. Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p>Can we say it's my birthday and get free stuff?</p>
<p>We'll say it's all our birthdays.</p>
<p>(MUMBLING)</p>
<p>(BANJO PLAYING)</p>
<p>Cousin Homer, how are you?</p>
<p>And this must be Bart and Lisa.</p>
<p>Well, aren't you nice-looking kids.</p>
<p>Hey, do you folks want to see a quilt that's been in our family for five generations?</p>
<p>I warned you he was an idiot.</p>
<p>Well, all I need is some moonshine and someone playing the harmonicky and I'm as happy as a pig in plop.</p>
<p>We're having lasagna and Caesar salad.</p>
<p>Don't laugh. They're doing the best they can.</p>
<p>So, Homer, how are you?</p>
<p>Just great. Things couldn't be better.</p>
<p>And how is our lovely Marge?</p>
<p>She, uh, was k*ll by a falling air conditioner.</p>
<p>Oh! Why, that's terrible!</p>
<p>Ooh, er, it wasn't all bad.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, her funeral was air conditioned.</p>
<p>Now if you'll excuse me, I have to use the outhouse again.</p>
<p>Well, we don't have an outhouse.</p>
<p>My recording studio!</p>
<p>So how are we related again?</p>
<p>Our dogs are brothers.</p>
<p><strong>Bart</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>(GASPS) I see Mom!</p>
<p>(GIGGLING)</p>
<p>I've got my groove back!</p>
<p>We've got to tell Dad! Where is he?</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>You lost that first game to hustle me!</p>
<p>(CLUCKING)</p>
<p>I can't believe how many manatees we saved today.</p>
<p>And the ones we can't save, we put to good use.</p>
<p>Hmmm.</p>
<p>What am I supposed to do, bury them at Arlington?</p>
<p>Marge? Homer?</p>
<p>These are for you.</p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p>Listen, I thought about what I did.</p>
<p>And it was really, really wrong.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Homie, I accept your apology.</p>
<p>I love you, Marge.</p>
<p>But I'm not coming back yet.</p>
<p>(EXCLAIMS IN DISBELIEF)</p>
<p>I've found a place where I'm needed.</p>
<p>You're needed at home!</p>
<p>And treated like I deserve.</p>
<p>You're needed at home!</p>
<p><em>I'm sorry, Home.</em></p>
<p>I just can't find it in my heart to come back right now.</p>
<p>Well, that's very reasonable.</p>
<p>You stole my wife! I'll k*ll you!</p>
<p>Homer, I have no interest in stealing your wife but Marge is getting something from her work with me.</p>
<p>Something a strong, passionate woman like her needs.</p>
<p>A Purpose.</p>
<p>WOW!</p>
<p>I can see why she loves you.</p>
<p>She doesn't love me. She's just trying to find herself.</p>
<p>(EXHALES) You know everything.</p>
<p>I don't know everything. I'm just a man.</p>
<p>And what a man!</p>
<p>Okay, the key to this thing is the manatees.</p>
<p>Is Marge saving them or k*ll them? Saving!</p>
<p>Okay. To save the manatees, I guess I could donate my time and money and help them build a...</p>
<p>Screw that!</p>
<p>Dad!</p>
<p>Those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees!</p>
<p>Check out those gentle, exotic sea creatures.</p>
<p>Let's whomp 'em!</p>
<p>(MOTORS REVVING)</p>
<p>(ALL LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Man, I just wish we could see their tears.</p>
<p>(PANTING)</p>
<p>Why don't you pick on someone your own size?</p>
<p>They are roughly our size.</p>
<p>In fact, they're bigger than us.</p>
<p>Look, if it were up to me I'd be harassing them with you.</p>
<p>If anything, I'd be the guy who took it too far.</p>
<p>But I love my wife and I want to win her back!</p>
<p>You're a brave man. And we respect two things, bravery and tattoos that look like barbed wire. Let's go.</p>
<p>(LAUGHS) Rubes!</p>
<p>What did you call us?</p>
<p>Catch me if you can!</p>
<p>Manatees! Defend!</p>
<p>(MOTOR REVVING)</p>
<p>(YELLING)</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>(HOMER GROANING)</p>
<p>Attention jet skiers.</p>
<p>I have a court order here requiring you to vacate these waters.</p>
<p>No court order's gonna tell me what to do.</p>
<p>Oh, man! It's notarized!</p>
<p>Let's boogie!</p>
<p>Homer, are you okay?</p>
<p>How many fingers am I holding up?</p>
<p>Poor dumb country mouse.</p>
<p>Can't even count.</p>
<p>(MOANS)</p>
<p>My sweet, sweet Homie!</p>
<p>You sacrificed yourself for the manatees.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Rubes. So many rubes...</p>
<p>Pounding me with their jet skis. Rubes...</p>
<p>Please, no, rubes.</p>
<p>(GROANING)</p>
<p>(RETCHING)</p>
<p>I'm gonna take you home and fix you up, 'cause you're the real endangered species, a devoted husband.</p>
<p>Marge, I'm always amazed you chose me.</p>
<p>And I always will.</p>
<p>Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p>(SIGHS)</p>
<p>I'm starting to think I should find a woman.</p>
<p>(BLEATING)</p>
<p>Yeah, Miranda was nice, but I'm not driving to Corpus Christi every time she needs a light bulb changed.</p>
<p>(BLEATS) Amen.</p>
<p>Hey, since we got the kids with us, why don't we all take a few days of much needed R&amp;R?</p>
<p>Don't you have to be back at work?</p>
<p>Yes. But I've got a friend who owes me a solid.</p>
<p>Smithers, who is this barrel-chested go-getter?</p>
<p>I believe it's a manatee posing as Homer Simpson, sir.</p>
<p>That's cute.</p>
<p>(PANTING)</p>
<p>I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.</p>
<p>Actually, sir, I believe he's about to die of dehydration.</p>
<p>Good heavens! Grab a sponge, man!</p>
<p>(WOMAN SINGING) <em>Ooh.</p>
<p>You might not ever get rich.</p>
<p>But let me tell you it's better than digging a ditch.</p>
<p>There ain't no telling who you might meet.</p>
<p>A movie star or maybe even an lndian chief.</p>
<p>Working at the car wash.</p>
<p>Working at the car wash, yeah!</p>
<p>Come on and sing it with me, car wash.</p>
<p>Sing it with the feeling now, car wash, yeah.</p>
<p>Come some of the work get's kind of hard.</p>
<p>This ain't no place to be.</p>
<p>If you planned on being a star.</p>
<p>Let me tell you it's always cool.</p>
<p>And the boss don't mind sometimes if you act a fool.</p>
<p>At the car wash Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>Talking about the car wash, yeah!</p>
<p>Come on y'all and sing it for me.</p>
<p>Car wash, whoo-hoo!</p>
<p>Car wash, yeah!</em></p>
