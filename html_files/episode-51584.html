<p>(SIGHS)   </p>
<p>Another great day in the books.   </p>
<p>Now to cap it all off<br />
with a medicated foot bath   </p>
<p>and a nice, deep-ear Q-tipping.   </p>
<p><em>(SNORING)</em>   </p>
<p>(PHONE RINGS)   </p>
<p>(EXCLAIMING)   </p>
<p>Hello?   </p>
<p><em>BOY: Grandfather! You've got to help me!</em>   </p>
<p>What? Is that you, Bart?   </p>
<p><em>That's right. It's me, Bart.</em>   </p>
<p><em>I'm so scared. I'm in jail!</em>   </p>
<p>- Jail?<br />
<em>- Please don't tell my dad or mom.</em>   </p>
<p><em>They'll be so mad.<br />
The policeman needs to talk to you.</em>   </p>
<p><em>MAN: Sir,<br />
your grandson is in big trouble.</em>   </p>
<p>No, not Bart. My little angel.   </p>
<p><em>Well, he was arrested for<br />
vandalism and shoplifting, sir.</em>   </p>
<p>Yeah, that sounds like Bart,<br />
that little devil.   </p>
<p><em>If you don't send his bail<br />
money in the next    minutes,</em>   </p>
<p><em>he's going straight to the downtown</em>   </p>
<p><em>juvenile detention center.</em>   </p>
<p><em>BOY: Grandfather! Help me! Please!</em>   </p>
<p>Don't worry, Bart.   </p>
<p>Just tell me what you<br />
need and I'll do it.   </p>
<p>Your Grampa loves you.   </p>
<p>I need to wire some money<br />
to an overseas account   </p>
<p>to bail my grandson<br />
out of an unnamed jail.   </p>
<p>Fill out this form.   </p>
<p>I didn't know my little<br />
Emma was in Colombia,   </p>
<p>let alone working as a drug mule.   </p>
<p>I'm just so thankful the<br />
Russian secret police   </p>
<p>will accept the title to my Lexus.   </p>
<p><em>MAN: Mr. Simpson,<br />
we've confirmed receipt.</em>   </p>
<p><em>Your grandson will be released...</em>   </p>
<p>Oh, thank God.   </p>
<p><em>...once you pay his processing fees,</em>   </p>
<p><em>holding cell costs and handcuff tax.</em>   </p>
<p>It's on its way, plus a little extra   </p>
<p>for you being so helpful.   </p>
<p>Did he reach out to his father?<br />
His mother?   </p>
<p>His dead grandmother?   </p>
<p>No. He came to me.   </p>
<p>Because Bart knew that he<br />
could count on his Grampa   </p>
<p>to get him out of any kind of jam.   </p>
<p>Mm.   </p>
<p>Oh, thank goodness you're out!   </p>
<p>Okay, okay, enough with the smooches.   </p>
<p>I don't care what you've done.<br />
All that matters   </p>
<p>is that no grandson of<br />
mine's gonna go to jail.   </p>
<p>Jail? Are you off your meds<br />
or on new meds?   </p>
<p>Bart, don't you remember?   </p>
<p>I just wired all that<br />
money to pay your bail.   </p>
<p>Whoa, Grampa, I think you were...   </p>
<p>scammed.   </p>
<p>Me, scammed? (LAUGHS)   </p>
<p>That's impossible.   </p>
<p>No one hornswoggles Abraham J...   </p>
<p>S-I-M-P-S-O-N.   </p>
<p>Social Security number:    -  -    .   </p>
<p>First pet's name: Homer.   </p>
<p>(GASPS)    </p>
<p>I've been hornswoggled.    </p>
<p><em>ANNOUNCER:<br />
You're watching the Punt Zone channel.</em>    </p>
<p><em>It's nothing but punts.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Never miss another exciting fair catch</em>    </p>
<p><em>or thrilling second of hang time.</em>    </p>
<p><em>It's fourth and long, here's the snap.</em>    </p>
<p><em>It's a fake punt! Cut away! Cut away!</em>    </p>
<p>Guys, something happened to Grampa.    </p>
<p>I got bamboozled out of my money    </p>
<p>by a flimflam artist.    </p>
<p>It's not his fault. Some scammer    </p>
<p>convinced him I was in jail.    </p>
<p>I'm so sorry, Grampa.    </p>
<p>Um, uh, let me go<br />
microwave your slippers.    </p>
<p>I don't deserve warm toes.    </p>
<p>I'm nothing but a feeble,<br />
useless, old idjit.    </p>
<p>No. You were just trying<br />
to be a good grandparent.    </p>
<p>And one bad apple took advantage of you.    </p>
<p>You got nothing to feel bad about.<br />
(LAUGHS)    </p>
<p>Bart in jail?<br />
I would have fallen for that, too.    </p>
<p>I mean, how much money<br />
could they have taken    </p>
<p>from a retired, old meatball man...    </p>
<p>   bucks plus a pocketful<br />
of hard candies?    </p>
<p>Here you go, Dad. I'll cover it.<br />
What's the damage?    </p>
<p>Ten thousand dollars!    </p>
<p>(ALL GASP)    </p>
<p>Where the hell did you<br />
get that kind of money,    </p>
<p>you broken-down old meatball man?    </p>
<p>It's    years of my cribbage winnings,    </p>
<p>saved up in a cigar box.    </p>
<p>I was gonna leave it to you,<br />
and now it's all gone.    </p>
<p>(GASPS)    </p>
<p>No. No.    </p>
<p>No!    </p>
<p>I had an inheritance<br />
and you gave it away?    </p>
<p>I'm so mad I could k*ll you,    </p>
<p>but now I'd get nothing.    </p>
<p>I hope you live forever!    </p>
<p>Now to read Abraham J. Simpson's    </p>
<p>final will and testament.    </p>
<p>To my surviving Homers,    </p>
<p>I leave you $  ,       </p>
<p>- that I never told you about...<br />
- (GIGGLES)    </p>
<p>- Oh!<br />
- Huh? - Yeah?    </p>
<p>...but then I lost it all to a scam.    </p>
<p>So, because I'm a moron,    </p>
<p>I leave you nothing.    </p>
<p>ALL: D'oh!    </p>
<p>Ten thousand dollars!    </p>
<p>(EXHALES) That dream again?    </p>
<p>The money's gone, gone.    </p>
<p>But how can you miss money<br />
you never knew you had?    </p>
<p>That's the worst part:<br />
to find out you got money,    </p>
<p>but you lost money, so you have it,    </p>
<p>but you don't have it.    </p>
<p>Oh, it's giving me whipcash.    </p>
<p>(WHIMPERS, GRUNTS)    </p>
<p>Just think of all the ways my<br />
life could have been better    </p>
<p>with that ten grand.    </p>
<p>(MOANS): Oh.    </p>
<p>So, uh, we're asking<br />
each family to chip in $      </p>
<p>for a new fundraising thermometer.    </p>
<p>Oh, yeah,    bucks...<br />
I would totally donate that    </p>
<p>if my father hadn't given away $  ,   !    </p>
<p>Um, it's just a suggested amount.    </p>
<p>Sure, ten grand might not sound<br />
like much to you teachers,    </p>
<p>but I choose inheriting $  ,       </p>
<p>over earning a million.    </p>
<p>And all of you would do the same!    </p>
<p>Homer, not here.    </p>
<p>Because generational<br />
wealth is the purest,    </p>
<p>most sacred kind of money there is.    </p>
<p>But my father fell for<br />
some super-obvious scam    </p>
<p>because his brain is made of    </p>
<p>powdered mashed potatoes.    </p>
<p>So, no, I will not be donating.    </p>
<p>(HUFFS)    </p>
<p>- Oh...<br />
- Marge, if I may, I-I dealt with a similar situation    </p>
<p>with my mother. She got a phone call    </p>
<p>claiming punk rockers were<br />
threatening to cut my hair    </p>
<p>into a Mohawk,<br />
which is a distinctive hairstyle...    </p>
<p>I know what it is.    </p>
<p>This place got us through it.    </p>
<p>Hmm.    </p>
<p>This could be just what we need.    </p>
<p>Oh, uh, sorry,<br />
that's not for you to keep.    </p>
<p>I don't get many business cards.    </p>
<p>Group therapy?<br />
In my day, we dealt with horrible shame    </p>
<p>by getting blind drunk,<br />
stumbling into a hobo camp    </p>
<p>and fighting their king.    </p>
<p>Sometimes it worked,<br />
sometimes it didn't.    </p>
<p>Just give it a try, Abe.    </p>
<p>It'll help to know<br />
that you're not alone.    </p>
<p>(CHUCKLES) Nice, Marge.    </p>
<p>Making Dad sit through<br />
a pathetic sob-fest    </p>
<p>with his fellow losers is<br />
the perfect punishment.    </p>
<p>There's a group for you, too.    </p>
<p>I... (GRUNTS) wish I never voted<br />
to build this community center.    </p>
<p>(MARGE GRUNTS)    </p>
<p>(SIGHS) I should have<br />
known mortgage lenders    </p>
<p>don't take Applebee's gift cards.    </p>
<p>He said if I didn't wire the<br />
money to the power company,    </p>
<p>they'd shut off my electricity.    </p>
<p>I<em> am</em> the power company.    </p>
<p>Catfished. Ooh!    </p>
<p>Now it seems so obvious    </p>
<p>that I would never meet<br />
the real Melissa Joan Hart    </p>
<p>in a online billiards forum.    </p>
<p>These criminals target<br />
the good in all of us,    </p>
<p>so the first step is<br />
to take a deep breath    </p>
<p>and forgive ourselves.    </p>
<p>(ALL INHALE, EXHALE)    </p>
<p>My mother paid hackers to return<br />
her stolen computer photos.    </p>
<p>(GROANS) They weren't gone.<br />
They were backed up    </p>
<p>to the cloud, Dropbox, Time Machine...    </p>
<p>things of that nature.    </p>
<p>Now, these are the things you<br />
should never say to a v*ctim.    </p>
<p>&quot;I would never have fallen for that,&quot;    </p>
<p>&quot;Everyone knows about that scam,&quot;    </p>
<p>and &quot;What were you thinking?&quot;    </p>
<p>I would have never fallen for that!    </p>
<p>Everyone knows about that scam!    </p>
<p>What were you thinking?!    </p>
<p>No, it wasn't my fault.    </p>
<p>This group taught me not to feel shame.    </p>
<p>I'm on a path of healing<br />
and self-empowerment.    </p>
<p>You better not be.    </p>
<p>Now, what do we say to shamers like him?    </p>
<p>ALL: Shaming is blaming.    </p>
<p>Yes,    % agree!    </p>
<p>(GRUNTS)    </p>
<p>How could you treat Grampa like that?    </p>
<p>You think you're so smart.<br />
Do you really think    </p>
<p>the same thing wouldn't<br />
have happened to you?    </p>
<p>Me? Impossible.    </p>
<p>I'm too savvy.    </p>
<p>This savvy! See?    </p>
<p>Dad, anyone can get scammed. Even me.    </p>
<p>I paid the bullies for wedgie insurance.    </p>
<p>But the minute I got a wedgie, bam!    </p>
<p>I got hit with a deductible...<br />
another wedgie!    </p>
<p>And my rates went up.    </p>
<p>That's why I never get any insurance.    </p>
<p>I got an email saying I qualified    </p>
<p>for the Saxophone Junior Olympics,    </p>
<p>but when I clicked the link,<br />
they hacked my phone    </p>
<p>and stole my Audible listener credits.    </p>
<p>(LAUGHS)    </p>
<p>You clicked the link? (LAUGHING)    </p>
<p>That's so... Who clicks the link?    </p>
<p>Even children are being scammed?    </p>
<p>Well, maybe there's a few more<br />
bad apples than I thought.    </p>
<p>But I still have to believe<br />
the barrel is mostly good.    </p>
<p>Oh, Marge, how I envy<br />
your sweet innocence.    </p>
<p>The world is a blender full<br />
of sharks set on extra teeth.    </p>
<p>So you got to be like me...<br />
always on guard    </p>
<p>- so you're never a sucker.<br />

<p>They're not knives.<br />
They're the future of cutlery.    </p>
<p>Put 'em in the garage with the others.    </p>
<p>Others?    </p>
<p>- (GASPS)<br />
- Cutlife is a famous    </p>
<p>multi-level marketing company.    </p>
<p>Dad, you fell for a pyramid scheme.    </p>
<p>Scheme? No way.    </p>
<p>They didn't even want to let me join.    </p>
<p>But, luckily, at the last minute,<br />
a space opened up.    </p>
<p>How many knives have you even sold?    </p>
<p>(LAUGHS) I don't sell them.    </p>
<p>I engage opportunity handlers    </p>
<p>to distributize them for me,    </p>
<p>the expandibution manager.    </p>
<p>It's all part of Charles E. Cutlife's    </p>
<p>three-dimensional triangle system.    </p>
<p>- Look!<br />
- BART: Why can't Dad    </p>
<p>ever get arrested in a suit?    </p>
<p>Face it, genius:    </p>
<p>you got scammed.    </p>
<p>(SOBS) She's right. Everyone's right.    </p>
<p>Don't look at my gullible face! (SOBS)    </p>
<p>And so I consign to the flames    </p>
<p>a monument to my own stupidity.    </p>
<p>- No!<br />
- (GRUNTS)    </p>
<p>Now, isn't there someone<br />
you need to apologize to?    </p>
<p>Maybe your father?    </p>
<p>Yeah, you're right.    </p>
<p>I said such horrible things to him.    </p>
<p>(GASPS)    </p>
<p>All that time I was yelling at you,    </p>
<p>it turns out I'm a sucker, too.    </p>
<p>Will you forgive me, Dad?    </p>
<p>Of course, son. Hopefully, we've all    </p>
<p>come out of this a little more savvy.    </p>
<p>(PHONE RINGS)    </p>
<p>Hello? Yes, this is a grandparent    </p>
<p>of a boy or girl.<br />
Sure, put him or her on the phone.    </p>
<p>No! Lisa's in jail!    </p>
<p>Grampa, they're trying<br />
to trick you again.    </p>
<p>(GASPS) It's the same swindler.    </p>
<p>He must think I'm greedy for more.    </p>
<p>(GASPS) I got an idea.    </p>
<p>Grampa, you got to keep talking<br />
so that guy stays on the phone.    </p>
<p>Keep talking? I've been preparing<br />
for this moment my entire life.    </p>
<p><em>MAN: Sir, look, if you don't</em>    </p>
<p><em>put up that bail money,<br />

<p>- (CRACK)<br />
- In my day, we didn't have fancy coolers,    </p>
<p>so everyone took turns blowing<br />
on the meat to keep it fresh,    </p>
<p>unless you hired a Dutch family<br />

<p><em>GRAMPA:<br />
It was quite the scandal when a breezy</em>    </p>

<p><em>to flatten your sandwiches<br />
by sitting on 'em...</em>    </p>

<p>Wow, that's some quality prattle.    </p>
<p>Okay, I've run<br />
all three hours of the call    </p>
<p>through open-source audio software,    </p>
<p>and the unique pattern of church bells    </p>
<p>and roller-coaster screams<br />
pins the location to...    </p>
<p>...ladies and gentlemen,<br />
the address of the scammer.    </p>
<p>Whoa, we could get the money back.    </p>
<p>It's not about the money.    </p>
<p>I want to show that bad<br />
guy the face of the old man    </p>
<p>whose love and decency he exploited.    </p>
<p>Oh, honey, you have a beautiful heart.    </p>
<p>But make no mistake...    </p>
<p>it is about the money!    </p>

<p>Kids, today you're gonna<br />
learn an important lesson:    </p>
<p>sometimes the sheep get back their wool.    </p>
<p>(SCOFFS) No, they don't.<br />
They just grow more wool.    </p>
<p>What are you, a shepherd? Come on, Dad.    </p>
<p>Let's go get my eventual money back.    </p>
<p>How are we gonna get past the guard?    </p>
<p>Aw, don't worry about that.    </p>
<p>My<em> friends</em> can get us in.    </p>
<p>That's the surgical<br />
precision you only get    </p>
<p>from the finest Idaho steel.    </p>
<p>Amazing. I'll take the full set.    </p>
<p>Oh, you're not buying the knives.    </p>
<p>I could sell them?    </p>
<p>No, you can sell other<br />
people on selling them.    </p>
<p>These knives sell selling<br />
themselves themselves.    </p>
<p>This is the opportunity of a lifetime!    </p>
<p>I'm gonna go tell my pregnant<br />
wife about my new career.    </p>

<p>Fluff, fluff.    </p>
<p>There's so many of them.    </p>
<p>(CLEARS THROAT)    </p>

<p>Another boiler room of phone hucksters.    </p>
<p>All right, scambags, you know the drill:    </p>

- What? - Really?    </p>

<p>Okay, I know this seems bad,<br />

<p>Oh, come on, Mom,<br />
you always see the good in everything.    </p>
<p>Well, on the bright side,    </p>
<p>if you look at it a certain way...    </p>
<p>there is no bright side!    </p>
<p>The whole world is one<br />
big criminal organization!    </p>

<p>Justice wasn't served,    </p>
<p>but dinner is.    </p>

<p>Revenge sliders dipped in payback sauce.    </p>
<p>Mmm.    </p>
<p>Honey, you're not sweating<br />
from overeating. What's wrong?    </p>
<p>These gift cards were obtained<br />
by scamming innocent people.    </p>
<p>So no, thank you.    </p>
<p>You said it yourself...    </p>
<p>everyone in the world is<br />
ripping off everyone else.    </p>
<p>Why shouldn't we wet our beaks?    </p>
<p>Oh, you got to try these fried beaks.    </p>
<p>Dip the beak! Dip the beak!    </p>
<p>Well, it seems like<br />
no one else has a problem    </p>
<p>gorging on ill-gotten appetizers.    </p>
<p>Beak me.    </p>
<p>(MUNCHING)    </p>

<p>the freak in the sandals, right? (BURPS)    </p>
<p>Yes, but this can't be real.    </p>
<p>We probably just ate too many<br />
wasabi mac and cheese balls.    </p>
<p>Silence, you mewling wretches,    </p>

<p>Buy crypto, suckers!    </p>
<p>And my handiwork of deception    </p>
<p>is woven into the<br />
fabric of the universe.    </p>
<p>From the Ticketmaster convenience fee    </p>
<p>to the NCAA.    </p>
<p>Oh, lord of appetizers,<br />
I kneel before you.    </p>
<p>Who shall I smother<br />
with ranch in your name?    </p>
<p>Well, Loki, you've already<br />
taken an old man's life savings.    </p>
<p>What more do you want?    </p>
<p>I have come here to...    </p>
<p>'Zerz...    </p>
<p>to take my prize:    </p>
<p>an honest woman's belief<br />
in the good of mankind.    </p>
<p>And now, as the old laws demand,    </p>
<p>I must bestow upon<br />
the vanquished a kiss.    </p>
<p>Mwah.    </p>
<p>Ha-ha! There are no old laws.    </p>

<p>Should we get the rest to go?    </p>
<p>Excuse me, I'm out of gas    </p>
<p>and left my wallet at home.    </p>
<p>Would you lend me $  ?    </p>
<p>I'll mail it back to you, I promise.    </p>
<p>Uh, I'm sorry,<br />

<p>Uh, go find another sucker.    </p>
<p>Is this it...<br />
from now on, I live in a world    </p>
<p>where nobody trusts anybody?    </p>
<p>No, not me.    </p>

<p>In your face, god of scams!    </p>
<p>(WHISTLES TUNE)    </p>
