<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Hymns here! I got hymns here! Get 'em while they're holy!</p>
<p>Fresh from God's brain to your mouth!</p>
<p>And now please rise for our opening hymn... uh, &quot;In the Garden of Eden&quot;... by I. Ron Butterfly.</p>
<p>In the garden of Eden, honey.</p>
<p>Don't you know that I love you.</p>
<p>In the garden of Eden, baby.</p>
<p>Don't you know that I'll always be true.</p>
<p>Hey, Marge, remember when we used to make out to this hymn?</p>
<p>Shh! Shh! Shh!</p>
<p>Oh, won't ya come with me.</p>
<p>And take my hand.</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>This sounds like rock and/or roll.</p>
<p><em>And walk this land</em></p>
<p>I know one of you is responsible for this.</p>
<p>So repeat after me: If I withhold the truth, may I go straight to hell... where I will eat naught but burning-hot coals... and drink naught but burning-hot cola.</p>
<p>Where fiery demons will punch me in the back... where my soul will be chopped into confetti... and strewn upon a parade of m*rder and single mothers... where my tongue will be torn out by ravenous birds.</p>
<p>Bart did it!</p>
<p>That Bart right there!</p>
<p>Milhouse!</p>
<p>Milhouse, you did the right thing.</p>
<p>Bart, come with me for punishment.</p>
<p>You too, snitchy.</p>
<p><em>I want you to clean every one of these organ pipes...</em> that you have befouled with your popular music.</p>
<p>You shank! How could you tell on me?</p>
<p>Well, I didn't want hungry birds pecking my soul forever.</p>
<p>Soul? Come on, Milhouse. There's no such thing as a soul.</p>
<p>It's just something they made up to scare kids... like the boogeyman, or Michael Jackson.</p>
<p>But every religion says there's a soul, Bart.</p>
<p>Why would they lie? What would they have to gain?</p>
<p>I don't hear scrubbing!</p>
<p>If your soul's real, where is it?</p>
<p>It's kinda in here... and when you sneeze, that's your soul trying to escape.</p>
<p>Saying &quot;God bless you&quot; crams it back in... and when you die it squirms out and flies away.</p>
<p>Uh-huh. What if you die in a submarine at the bottom of the ocean?</p>
<p>Oh, it can swim.</p>
<p>It's even got wheels, in case you die in the desert and it has to drive to the cemetery.</p>
<p>How can someone with glasses that thick be so stupid?</p>
<p>Listen, you don't have a soul, I don't have a soul.</p>
<p>There's no such thing as a soul!</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>If you're so sure about that, why don't you sell your soul to me?</p>
<p>How much you got?</p>
<p>Five bucks.</p>
<p>Deal.</p>
<p>There you go. One soul.</p>
<p>Pleasure doing business with you.</p>
<p>Anytime, chum... p.</p>
<p>All right, where would you kids like to eat tonight?</p>
<p>The Spaghetti Laboratory!</p>
<p>Face-Stuffers!</p>
<p>Professor V.J. Cornucopia's Fantastic Foodmagorium and Great American Steakery.</p>
<p>Well, what about this place?</p>
<p>Moe's.</p>
<p>Aah! Natural light!</p>
<p>Get it off me! Get it off me!</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry. I thought this was a family restaurant.</p>
<p>Oh, it is. It is.</p>
<p>Just, uh, pull them stools up to the pool table.</p>
<p>Daddy, this place... smells like tinkle!</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. I think we'll just go to the Texas Cheesecake Depository.</p>
<p>Everybody is going to family restaurants these days.</p>
<p>Seems nobody wants to hang out in a dank pit no more.</p>
<p>You ain't thinkin' of gettin' rid of the dank, are ya, Moe?</p>
<p>Ahh, maybe I am.</p>
<p>Ah, but, Moe, the dank- the dank!</p>
<p>Yeah, family restaurants. That's where the big bucks are.</p>
<p>I could turn this joint into a place... where you wouldn't be ashamed to bring your family!</p>
<p>I'm not ashamed.</p>
<p>Hey, put a coaster under that.</p>
<p>Oh, Lisa!</p>
<p>There's a little present for you lying in the driveway!</p>
<p>Oh, boy! Really?</p>
<p>Aaah! No! It's dripping funny-smelling water all over me!</p>
<p>I wasted five bucks on these.</p>
<p>Where'd you get five bucks? I want five bucks.</p>
<p>I sold my soul to Milhouse.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>How could you do that? Your soul is the most valuable part of you.</p>
<p>You believe in that junk?</p>
<p>Well, whether or not the soul is physically real, Bart... it's the symbol of everything fine inside us.</p>
<p>Tsk-tsk-tsk. Poor, gullible Lisa.</p>
<p>I'll keep my crappy sponges, thanks.</p>
<p>Bart, your soul is the only part of you that lasts forever.</p>
<p>For five dollars, Milhouse could own you for a zillion years.</p>
<p>Well, if you think he got such a good deal, I'll sell you my conscience for 4.50.</p>
<p>I'll throw in my sense of decency too.</p>
<p>It's a Bart sales event! Everything about me must go!</p>
<p>Hey, boy. How ya doin'?</p>
<p>Man! What's gotten into you?</p>
<p>Geez! You're pretty uppity for someone who eats bugs all day.</p>
<p>Stupid a*t*matic door.</p>
<p>Thank you, door!</p>
<p><em>Some ice cream guy's gonna see that, and it'll blow his mind.!</em></p>
<p>Let me try.</p>
<p>Way to breathe, No-Breath.</p>
<p>This is getting weird.</p>
<p>Sanjay, to the entrance with the Windex.</p>
<p><em>Sanjay, to the entrance with the Windex.</em></p>
<p>So, come on. I need a name that says friendly, all-American cooking.</p>
<p>How about Chairman Moe's Magic Wok?</p>
<p>I like it!</p>
<p>Nah. I want something that says people can have a nice, relaxing time.</p>
<p>I got it! Madman Moe's Pressure Cooker!</p>
<p>I like it!</p>
<p>Hey, how about Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag?</p>
<p>I hate it.</p>
<p><em>Oh, boy! The deep fryer's here.</em></p>
<p>I got it used from the navy.</p>
<p>You could flash-fry a buffalo in 40 seconds.</p>
<p>Forty seconds? But I want it now!</p>
<p>The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show.</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>I know that's funny, but I'm just not laughing.</p>
<p>Hmm. Pablo Neruda said laughter is the language of the soul.</p>
<p>I am familiar with the works of Pablo Neruda.</p>
<p>I think we should do a test.</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Help! Help!</p>
<p>Somebody help me! I'm stuck in a banister!</p>
<p>Well?</p>
<p>Nope. I don't feel a thing.</p>
<p>That's creepy, Bart.</p>
<p>I think you really did lose your soul.</p>
<p>Good boy!</p>
<p>Ow! Ow! Who's doing that?</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Ow! Help me! Ow!</p>
<p>Why isn't anybody- Ow! helping?</p>
<p>Hi. Is Milhouse home?</p>
<p>He's playing in the dirt with his army men.</p>
<p><em>Oh, and a white piece of paper, I believe.</em></p>
<p>Cover me, Sarge. I'm going after Bart's soul.</p>
<p>If the ayatollah can't have it, no one can!</p>
<p>Uh, you know, Milhouse-</p>
<p>Ye-e-e-es?</p>
<p>Bet you're gettin' tired of that soul, huh?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Well, suppose someone wanted to buy it from you.</p>
<p>Oh. You wanna buy it back, Bart?</p>
<p>Sure. No problem.</p>
<p>Fifty bucks.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Who's stupid now, huh?</p>
<p>If you like good food, good fun... and a whole lot of crazy crap on the walls... then come on down to Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag.</p>
<p>At Moe's, we serve good, old-fashioned home cooking... deep-fried to perfection.</p>
<p>Now, that's &quot;Moe&quot; like it!</p>
<p>So bring the whole family- mom, dad, kids.</p>
<p>Uh, no old people. They're not covered by our insurance.</p>
<p>It's fun! And remember our guarantee.</p>
<p>If I'm not smiling when your check comes, your meal's on me- Uncle Moe!</p>
<p>Come to Uncle Moe's for family fun.</p>
<p>It's good, good, good, good Good-good-good.</p>
<p>Mmm! Sounds good.</p>
<p>Mmm!</p>
<p>Hmm. Bart, what's wrong? There's something a little off about your hug.</p>
<p>Mom, I need to tell you something. I kind of-</p>
<p>Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Let me guess. A mother can always tell.</p>
<p>Mm-mmm.</p>
<p>Hmm. It's not fear of nuclear w*r.</p>
<p>Mm-mmm.</p>
<p>It's not swim test anxiety.</p>
<p>It almost feels like you're missing something- something important.</p>
<p>Like I don't have a soul?</p>
<p>Aw, honey. You're not a monster.</p>
<p><em>My soul's my best friend.!</em></p>
<p>My soul's like a toy that never breaks.</p>
<p><em>I'm master blaster!</p>
<p>My soul can take your soul.!</em></p>
<p>Bart sold his soul And that's just swell.</p>
<p>Now he's going straight to <em>Hello, operator Give me number nine.</p>
<p>No soul, huh?</em></p>
<p>Don't worry. I'm still behind ya.</p>
<p>Ha-ha!</p>

<p>Ahoy there, friends! Everybody find a first mate!</p>
<p>Oh! I choose Martin!</p>
<p>Wait. Wait for me!</p>
<p>Bart, it's time to end this dream.</p>
<p>And don't forget the standard scream.</p>
<p>An alligator with sunglasses?</p>
<p>Huh! Now I've seen everything.</p>
<p>Hiya, folks. Welcome to Uncle Moe's.</p>
<p>Aw, look at all the cute little minors.</p>
<p>Wow, that's Moe. The guy from the ad!</p>
<p>Right this way, Homer.</p>
<p>And he knows my name!</p>
<p>Street signs indoors? Whatever!</p>
<p>Now, Rod, you order anything you want for your big 10-0.</p>
<p>Million-dollar birthday fries!</p>
<p>Uh-oh!</p>
<p>&quot;Moe gets so excited when you order his million-dollar birthday fries... he just has to celebrate.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Here you go! Here I am!</em></p>
<p>Uncle Moe! Thank you, ma'am! This'll be a treat!</p>
<p>Uncle Moe! Here I am, while you eat!</p>
<p>Please take the fries off my head, kid.</p>
<p>The basket is extremely hot.</p>
<p>How are the southwestern pizza fingers?</p>
<p>Uh, they're, um, &quot;awesomely outrageous.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, these look good- &quot;Guilt-Free Steak-fish Fillets.&quot;</p>
<p>Let me level with you, Marge. That's just our name for bottom-feeding suction eel.</p>
<p>You don't want that. Why don't you try Moe's Hobo Chicken Chili.</p>
<p>I start with the best part- the neck.</p>
<p>And then I add secret hobo spices.</p>
<p><em>Ooh! Très bien.!</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing, you little freak?</p>
<p>Ooh, sorry, kid. Sorry. I'm not used to the laughter of children.</p>
<p>It cuts through me like a dentist's drill.</p>
<p>But, no, that was funny, you taking away my dignity like that. Ha-ha.</p>
<p>I would like to say grace.</p>
<p><em>Lord, have mercy on my soul... and Mom's soul, and Dad's soul, and Maggie's soul.</p>
<p>And let every soul in Christendom-</em></p>
<p>Bart!</p>
<p>I can't take this anymore! I want my soul, and I want it now!</p>
<p>Bart! You didn't finish your spaghetti and Moe-balls!</p>
<p>Silence, you fool. It can be ours.</p>
<p>Run, boy! Run!</p>
<p><em>Run for your life... boy.!</em></p>
<p>Milhouse.</p>
<p>Milhouse, you win. I want this nightmare to end.</p>
<p>Leave this place. You are in great danger.</p>
<p>Where's Milhouse?</p>
<p>The one you call Milhouse... is gone.</p>
<p>He went to his grandma's place while we're sprayin' for potato bugs.</p>
<p>Oh. When Milhouse left, did you notice if he was carrying a piece of paper?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. You don't forget a thing like that.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>Here you go! Here I am! Uncle Moe! Thank you, ma'am!</p>
<p>This'll be a treat! Uncle Moe! Here I am, while you eat!</p>
<p>Yea! Now do it for Terri!</p>
<p>What, it's your birthday too?</p>
<p>We're twins.</p>
<p>Here you go. Here I am. Eat your fries. Eat 'em.</p>
<p>Here's you!</p>
<p>Aw, geez. And you got the stink lines and everything?</p>
<p><em>Oh, dude, you did not smile. We eat for free.</em></p>
<p>Come on, Shoshana. Let's roll. Ha-ha!</p>
<p>But I sang you the potato stuffings!</p>
<p>Come on! I sang you the potato stuffings!</p>
<p>Look at the vein on that guy's forehead. He's gonna blow!</p>
<p><em>Unkie Moe?</em></p>
<p>What... is it, sweetheart?</p>
<p>My sodie is too cold. My teef hurt.</p>
<p>Oh, your &quot;teef&quot; hurt, huh? Your &quot;teef&quot; hurt?</p>
<p>Well, that's too freakin' bad! I'll tell you where you can put your freakin' &quot;sodie&quot; too!</p>
<p><em>Oh, my goodness.!</em></p>
<p>Ow! My freakin' ears!</p>
<p>Oh, let's go, dear.</p>
<p>Well, I expect that type of language at Denny's, but not here!</p>
<p>Aw, come on, folks, wait.</p>
<p>Please come back. Please! I got a new offer.</p>
<p>Whenever Uncle Moe threatens you, you get a free steak-fish.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, Milhouse's grandmother lives on 257 th Street... and I'm on 3rd.</p>
<p>Ohh.</p>
<p>Well, finally, a little luck.</p>
<p><em>I know you and your wife and every part of you</em></p>
<p>Son, you wait here while Daddy tries to talk some sense into this raving derelict.</p>
<p>Ah, what the hell do you want- You still owe me $50-</p>
<p>Slow down. Slow down!</p>
<p>Alfred Hitchcock stole every idea I ever had! He came into my room and-</p>
<p>Who's been stealing your thoughts?</p>
<p><em>Did you ever read The Old Curiosity Shop? They made that with John Gielgud-</p>
<p>I have powers that-</em></p>
<p>Hello, Ralph.</p>
<p>Aah! Uh, hi, Bart.</p>
<p>I know you from school.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>A simple proposition, Ralph. How would you like to make a dollar?</p>
<p>Uh, I don't know.</p>
<p>All you have to do is sign a paper that says I can have your soul.</p>
<p>I need a soul, Ralph. Any soul.</p>
<p>Yours!</p>
<p>Hey! What's going on over there?</p>
<p>Go on, take it all. Get it all outta here.</p>
<p>You know, Moe, you might wanna keep the fire extinguishers.</p>
<p>Nah. Too many bad memories.</p>
<p>Well, look at the bright side, Moe- you still got us.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. You know, that actually makes me feel a little better.</p>
<p><em>Why? That was the problem in the first place.</em></p>
<p>You were going broke because we were your only customers.</p>
<p>Wasn't that the problem in the first place, that you were going broke?</p>
<p>Moe? Moe?</p>
<p>Hey! Moe?</p>
<p>You're thinking about all the money you blew, aren't ya?</p>
<p>What was it, 50- $60,000? Moe?</p>
<p>Look, maybe it would help if you went over all the mistakes you made from the beginning. Moe?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Let me get a pad.</p>
<p>A caller, at this hour?</p>
<p>You dial &quot;9-1,&quot; then when I say so, dial &quot;1&quot; again.</p>
<p>Milhouse, please.</p>
<p>Bart, I can't play now. It's 2:00 a. m.</p>
<p>Milhouse, I gotta have my soul back. I'll do anything you want.</p>
<p>Uh, well-</p>
<p>Uh, Milhouse, give him back his soul! I've got work tomorrow!</p>
<p>I'm really sorry. I kinda traded your soul to the guy at the comic book store.</p>
<p>But look- I got some cool pogs.</p>
<p>Alf pogs! Remember Alf?</p>
<p>He's back, in pog form!</p>
<p>You traded my soul for pogs?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p><em>Close that door.! You're letting the heat out.!</p>
<p>Shut up, shut up, shut up.!</em></p>
<p>If you are waiting for the Hi and Lois signing... it has been moved to the Springfield Coliseum.</p>
<p>Please. You have something of mine on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Oh. So you're Bart Simpson.</p>
<p>Since my breakfast burrito is congealing rapidly, I will be blunt.</p>
<p>You are too late. I sold your soul last night.</p>
<p><em>Yes, yes. I found a buyer right away for that item.</em></p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>I am not at liberty to divulge the party.</p>
<p>But they were most interested in having possession of a little boy's soul.</p>
<p>Uh, excuse me. No banging your head on the display case, please.</p>
<p><em>It contains a very rare Mary Worth...</em> in which she has advised a friend to commit su1c1de, thank you.</p>
<p>Are you there, God?</p>
<p>It's me, Bart Simpson.</p>
<p>I know I never pay too much attention in church... but I could really use some of that good stuff now.</p>
<p>I'm... afraid.</p>
<p>I'm afraid some weirdo's got my soul, and I don't know what they're doing to it.</p>
<p>I just want it back.</p>
<p>Please?</p>
<p>I hope you can hear this.</p>
<p>Lisa! You bought this?</p>
<p>With the change in my piggy bank.</p>
<p>There's no change in your piggy bank.</p>
<p>Not in any of the ones you know about.</p>
<p>Oh, Lise, thank you.</p>
<p>Happy to do it.</p>
<p>But you know, Bart, some philosophers believe... that nobody is born with a soul... that you have to earn one through suffering and thought and prayer... like you did last night.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p><em>Ha.! It's like punting on the Thames. Stroke. Stroke.</em></p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
