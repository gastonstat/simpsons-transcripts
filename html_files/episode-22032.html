<p>Then I stroll down to the car wash to see if Gus is there.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. You've gotta keep busy.</p>
<p>I collect matchbooks from glamorous nightclubs.</p>
<p>It's amazing. If you just write to them and ask them nicely-</p>
<p>Is this how you imagined your life, Edna?</p>

<p>More tea, Edna?</p>
<p>What kind of little boy has a tea set?</p>
<p>[Chuckles] I think we both know the answer to that.</p>
<p>A lucky boy!</p>

<p>Now, Bart, son...</p>
<p>I don't know what you think you saw, but let me assure you-</p>
<p>What Seymour- Oh! What Principal Skinner means to say, Bart... is that sometimes a little boy's imagination can run away with him.</p>
<p>That's the best you can do?</p>
<p>You could've at least said you were giving her C.P.R., or rehearsing a play.</p>
<p>Is it too late to say that?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>[Clears Throat]</p>
<p>We're just a little concerned. If people were to find out... the principal was dating a teacher, they might see it as a conflict of interest.</p>

<p>Deal.</p>
<p>This is a great day for forbidden love.</p>
<p>Mmm, this dessert is exquisite. What do you call it?</p>
<p>Applesauce.</p>
<p>[Laughs] Of course.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I don't get out to restaurants much.</p>
<p>That's okay. I don't entertain much.</p>
<p>Usually, it's just soup for one, salad for one, wine for three.</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] You know, I always thought...</em></p>
<p>I'd fall for a woman just like Mother.</p>
<p>Even though I didn't want to. And now that I haven't...</p>

<p>You wouldn't happen to have any real cakes around here, would you?</p>
<p>Oh, my, no! I don't care for cake. Too sweet.</p>

<p><em><strong>Woman</strong>: Let's go! Come on! Come on!</em></p>
<p>So, once again, I've been had.</p>
<p>But an even more interesting story has developed high atop this two-story school.</p>
<p>A love story.</p>
<p>Skinner, get off of my school!</p>
<p>No. You get off of <em>my</em> school.</p>
<p>Homer, Bart's up there!</p>
<p>Give me that! [Over Bullhorn] Bart, this is your father!</p>
<p>Do you know where the remote is? I looked all over the house.</p>
<p>[Shouting] Did you check your pocket?</p>
<p>[Bullhorn] It was- [Turns Off Bullhorn] It was in my pocket.</p>
<p>&quot;Fine. Stay in the school. We don't want you to come out.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Bart</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p>Damn!</p>
<p>All right, boys. Roll up the sound truck.</p>
<p>We'll blast them out with music.</p>
<p>[Brakes Hissing]</p>
<p><em>[Feedback Squealing]</em></p>
<p>♪ [Piano]</p>
<p><em>♪ [Big Band]</em></p>
<p>Oh, Edna, I hope this siege never ends.</p>
<p>Seymour, you're heaven in Hush Puppies.</p>
<p>[Groaning] Turn the music off!</p>
<p>Ha! It's working like a charm, boys.</p>
<p>Now, cut the power and hit 'em with the lights!</p>
<p>[Relays Clicking]</p>
<p><em>♪ [Continues]</em></p>
<p>[Groaning] Ugh!</p>
<p>[Ringing]</p>
<p>[Grunting]</p>
<p>I'll get it.</p>
<p>[Rings]</p>
<p>Talk to me.</p>
<p>You have got to end this thing, Seymour.</p>
<p>We're not coming down until our jobs are reinstated... and you acknowledge and celebrate our love.</p>
<p>No one would like to celebrate your love more than I.</p>
<p>But I am a public servant, and not permitted to use my own judgment in any way.</p>
<p>Then let us take our case directly to the townspeople.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. That'll be real productive.</p>
<p>Who do you want to talk to first? The guy in the bumblebee suit... or the one with the bone through his hair?</p>
<p>My opinions are as valid as the next man's!</p>
<p>Yeah, all right. Just come on down.</p>
<p>[Beeps]</p>
<p>Well, this is it.</p>
<p>What are you going to do?</p>
<p>I'm going to go out there... and tell every man, woman and child that I love Edna Krabappel!</p>
<p>Well, that's nice. But first you gotta grab their attention. And I think I know how.</p>
<p>I have a b*mb!</p>
<p>[All Gasping]</p>
<p>Hey, wait a minute! Those are hot dogs! Armour Hot Dogs!</p>
<p>What kind of man wears Armour Hot Dogs?</p>
<p>It was a good idea, Bart. But it's just not working.</p>
<p>Just speak from the heart, Seymour.</p>
<p>Tell them how we brought a little happiness into each other's lives.</p>
<p>Ask them why they're forcing two dedicated people... to choose between their careers and their hearts!</p>
<p>Excuse me, Edna. I don't think we're talking about love here.</p>
<p>We're talking about S-E-X in front of the C-H-l-L-D-R-E-N.</p>
<p>Sex Cauldron? I thought they closed that place down!</p>
<p>What are you people talking about?</p>
<p>My child told me you two were having sex in the school janitor's closet.</p>
<p>You know, making babies!</p>
<p>Yes! Illicit sex!</p>
<p>Doing &quot;it!&quot; &quot;It!&quot; &quot;It!&quot;</p>
<p>Sordid, public, sexual congress!</p>
<p>This is absurd! I did not have relations in that closet!</p>
<p>And the fact is, I haven't- [Gasps]</p>
<p>Uh-</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>Seymour, I think you'd better tell them.</p>
<p>It's the only way to clear our names.</p>
<p>[Clicks Tongue, Exhales] Well, everyone... the fact is, I haven't ever had relations.</p>
<p>I am a virgin.</p>
<p>Ha-ha!</p>
<p>[Muttering]</p>
<p>Hey! Does this mean that Mrs. Krabappel is a virgin too?</p>
<p><em>[Nelson] Ha!</em></p>
<p>Well, Seymour, it's clear you've been falsely accused... because no one, anywhere, ever... would pretend to be a 44-year-old virgin.</p>
<p>Oh, that's for sure!</p>
<p>I'm inclined to agree.</p>
<p>Ach! I'll never look at him the same again.</p>
<p>That was more than I wanted to know.</p>
<p>[Clearing Throat] Okay, well, um-</p>
<p>Edna, Seymour, in light of these, uh, revelations...</p>
<p>I suppose we overreacted.</p>
<p>Do we have our jobs back?</p>
<p>What? Oh, yes, yes, yes. Sure.</p>
<p>Just, uh, you know, keep the lewdness to a minimum.</p>
<p><em>[Whispering, Indistinct]</em></p>
<p>I'm outta here! Skinny, Crabby, catch you later.</p>
<p>Uh, hold on, Bart. May we have a word with you?</p>
<p>We want to thank you for helping us through a difficult period.</p>
<p>Oh! No problemo. So, I guess now you'll be getting married or something, huh?</p>
<p>Well, actually, Seymour and I have decided to break up.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>We can't continue on like this... trying to build a private relationship in public- the whole town watching our every move with a fine-tooth comb-</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. I'm used to humiliation. But not in front of a crowd that size.</p>
<p>Oh, but you seemed like such a good couple.</p>
<p>Bart, when you get a little older... you're going to learn that sometimes romances don't turn out... exactly the way you'd like them to.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>That's why I love elementary school, Edna.</p>
<p>The children believe anything you tell them.</p>
<p>[Laughing]</p>
<p>[Both Laughing]</p>
<p><em>[Champagne Cork Pops]</p>
<p>[Edna] Whoo! Oh, Seymour!</em></p>
<p>[Murmuring]</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
