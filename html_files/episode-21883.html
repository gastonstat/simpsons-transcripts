							<p>I think the boy's hurt.</p>
<p>Just give him a nickel and let's get going!</p>
<p>I think we should call an ambulance, sir.</p>
<p>Hey, cool. I'm dead!</p>
<p>Please hold on to the handrail.</p>
<p>Do not spit over the side.</p>
<p>Aunt Hortense. Great-grandpa Simpson.</p>
<p>Snowball!</p>
<p>Do not spit over the side.</p>
<p>We told you to hold on to the handrail.</p>
<p>We asked you not to spit over the side.</p>
<p>Howdy, stranger!</p>
<p>I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?</p>
<p>Please allow me to introduce myself. I'm the devil!</p>
<p>You've earned eternal damnation for your evil deeds.</p>
<p>Spitting just clinched it.</p>
<p>Hey, I'm innocent, man!</p>
<p>Innocent! Everybody's innocent.</p>
<p>Okay, let's just pull up your file here.</p>
<p>It's a mistake. You're due to arrive when the Yankees win the pennant.</p>
<p>Nearly a century from now. Boy, is my face red!</p>
<p>Bart!</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do to avoid coming back here?</p>
<p>Sure, but you wouldn't like it.</p>
<p>Okay. See you later.</p>
<p>Bye!</p>
<p>Remember, lie, cheat, steal and listen to heavy metal music!</p>
<p>Yes, sir!</p>
<p>Dr. Warner, wanted in radiology.</p>
<p>He's awake!</p>
<p>Oh, Bart!</p>
<p>We thought you'd gone away from us.</p>
<p>I did go away, Mom!</p>
<p>I was miles away, writhing in agony in the pits of hell!</p>
<p>And you were there! And you. And you. And you.</p>
<p>You I've never seen before.</p>
<p>Yeah, I saw you chasing Bart's ambulance.</p>
<p>Lionel Hutz is the name. Attorney at law. My card.</p>
<p>It turns into a sponge in water.</p>
<p>Classy.</p>
<p>Would you like to bring legal action against the fiend who did this?</p>
<p>The fiend who did this to my boy is my boss.</p>
<p>Besides, the doctor says it's just a bump on the head and a broken toe.</p>
<p>Doctors are idiots!</p>
<p>He might have permanent injuries. You may have to wait on him... for the rest of his life! That's the downside.</p>
<p>Here's the good part. You can cash in on this tragedy!</p>
<p>Excuse me, are you a shyster?</p>
<p>How does a nice girl know that word?</p>
<p>Mr. Hutz, this is hardly the time to discuss this.</p>
<p>You're right. When you're up to it, come to my office and we'll talk.</p>
<p>Lionel Hutz, attorney at law. Is that a broken neck? Great!</p>
<p>Hello, Dr. Hibbert.</p>
<p>Hello, Lisa.</p>
<p>We've got a nasty bump on our head.</p>
<p>Quit it!</p>
<p>And a tiny broken toe.</p>
<p>Quit it!</p>
<p>Is he well enough for me to start mothering him?</p>
<p>Better let him rest a while.</p>
<p>I heard Mr. Burns crushed your boy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If I wasn't so spineless, I'd march into Mr. Burns' office now and--</p>
<p>Simpson! Burns wants you to march into his office now!</p>
<p>Simpson, at last we meet.</p>
<p>Nice to meet you too, sir.</p>
<p>My attorneys advised me to pay for running over your child.</p>
<p>So I'm cutting you a check.</p>
<p>Really? Great.</p>
<p>$100. Of course, you'll have to sign a waiver... relinquishing your right to sue.</p>
<p>100 bucks? It's a generous offer, sir, but his medical bills alone--</p>
<p>So extortion is the name of your game?</p>
<p>Then you get nothing! I have the finest lawyers in Springfield.</p>
<p>Tangle with me, and I'll crush you like a paper cup.</p>
<p>Throw him out, Smithers!</p>
<p>You don't have to do that. I can throw myself out.</p>
<p>Lionel Hutz.</p>
<p>In here, Mr. Simpson.</p>
<p>Any calls, Della?</p>
<p>Calls? Oh, &quot;calls&quot;!</p>
<p>The Supreme Court called. They need your help on a freedom thing.</p>
<p>Tell them to sit tight. I'll get back to them. This way, Mr. Simpson.</p>
<p>You sure have got some education.</p>
<p>Yes, Harvard, Yale, MIT, Oxford, the Sorbonne, the Louvre.</p>
<p>Oh, well.</p>
<p>Mr. Simpson, the state bar forbids me... from promising you a big cash settlement.</p>
<p>But just between you and me, I promise you... a big cash settlement. My fee is 50 percent.</p>
<p>50 percent?</p>
<p>You'll be getting more than a lawyer!</p>
<p>You'll also get this faux pearl necklace... a $99 value, as our gift.</p>
<p>I don't know. You and I might have different ideas... about how big a big cash settlement is.</p>
<p>A million dollars?</p>
<p>I stand corrected! A million bucks is A-Okay!</p>
<p>Now we'll get a real doctor's opinion.</p>
<p>Bad news!</p>
<p>Your son is a very sick boy. Just look at the X-rays!</p>
<p>You see that dark spot there? Whiplash.</p>
<p>Oh, no!</p>
<p>And this smudge that looks like my fingerprint?</p>
<p>No. That's trauma!</p>
<p>Am I going to die?</p>
<p>Yes, son!</p>
<p>Homer!</p>
<p>No, of course you won't. Everything's fine.</p>
<p>Will I ever play baseball again?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>But I played this morning.</p>
<p>That's right, he did.</p>
<p>Dr. Hibbert has been our physician for years. He thought Bart was fine.</p>
<p>Oh, Dr. Hibbert, from Johns Hopkins Medical School.</p>
<p>Mrs. Simpson, you're not a doctor. He's not, I'm not.</p>
<p>The only person here who comes close is him.</p>
<p>Stop, you're embarrassing me!</p>
<p>Are you sure there isn't soft tissue trauma in the face?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Tons of it. Just say when.</p>
<p>A million dollars? Smithers! I want this Homer Simpson fired!</p>
<p>Do you think that's wise? Think of the headlines.</p>
<p>What about them?</p>
<p>They might be critical of you firing him so soon after the accident.</p>
<p>All right then. I don't want to seem like an ogre.</p>
<p>I'll bide my time.</p>
<p>Let him twist in the wind. Slowly, slowly.</p>
<p>When the papers have found their new flavor of the month... he'll find out this cat has claws!</p>
<p>Good thinking.</p>
<p>Now, let's pretend you're on the witness stand.</p>
<p>How are you, Bart?</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Bart says he's fine.</p>
<p>You are not fine! You are in constant pain!</p>
<p>I am in constant pain.</p>
<p>May I make an observation?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>This is a charade to make him look more injured than he is.</p>
<p>Maybe Lisa has a point.</p>
<p>I don't mind it here, but in court, doesn't he have to tell the truth?</p>
<p>But what is truth, if you follow me?</p>
<p>Bart, can you roll your eyes back in your head like this?</p>
<p>You mean like I'm dead? Sure.</p>
<p>The kid's a pro.</p>
<p>Springfield Municipal Court is now in session. Judge Moulton presiding.</p>
<p>My client's instructed me to remind you how rich he is... and that he's not like other men.</p>
<p>I should be able to run over as many kids as I want!</p>
<p>I warn you, if you continue to disrupt the court... I'll cite you for contempt.</p>
<p>You wouldn't dare!</p>
<p>Well, no, I guess I wouldn't.</p>
<p>Calling Bartholomew J. Simpson to the stand.</p>
<p>Oh, please!</p>
<p>Hello, Bart. You know the difference between telling the truth... and telling a lie, don't you?</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Well, you wouldn't lie to the United States, would you, Bart?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Proceed, Mr. Hutz.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Tell the jury, in your own words... what happened on the day of the accident.</p>
<p>Yes, sir. It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>I played in my childlike way, not realizing I was about to be struck... by the luxury car of death!</p>
<p>Defenseless child at 3:00!</p>
<p>Luckily, I was not k*ll.</p>
<p>Although sometimes I wish I had been.</p>
<p>He's lying!</p>
<p>Now, that's believable testimony.</p>
<p>Mr. Burns, relate in your own words... what really happened on the day of the accident.</p>
<p>Certainly. It was a beautiful day.</p>
<p>The sun was shining. I was driving to the orphanage to pass out toys.</p>
<p>Suddenly, that incorrigible Simpson boy darted in front of me.</p>
<p>My goodness! Look what's happened!</p>
<p>It's not important. Let's drive on.</p>
<p>You cold-blooded monster!</p>
<p>Regardless of what you think, we must summon help... and comfort him until an ambulance arrives.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Take me, I'm old!</p>
<p>And that's what happened.</p>
<p><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content"><br />

<p>Why are you looking at me like that? You believed his story!</p>
<p>It's looking good, Mr. Simpson. It's looking very good.</p>
<p>They hate me? What trial were you watching?</p>
<p>Maybe a settlement--</p>
<p>Settlement! Fine!</p>
<p>Hang your heads in shame... you overpriced, under-brained notary publics!</p>
<p>Just get that ape to my house and we'll buy him off with a banana!</p>
<p>And that ugly customer was the last lndonesian rhino on earth.</p>
<p>I didn't know you liked animals.</p>
<p>I don't like everything about them. Just their heads.</p>
<p>Care for some wine, old buddy?</p>
<p>Don't mind if I do.</p>
<p>Go, go!</p>
<p>Bottoms up. There's plenty more where that came from.</p>
<p>Are you trying to get me drunk?</p>
<p>Yes. Now, old chum... I'm sure you agree this trial is an affront to our collective dignity.</p>
<p>What say we settle this, man to man?</p>
<p>You mean duke it out?</p>
<p>No, I mean I'm prepared to offer you a generous cash settlement.</p>
<p>A princely sum--</p>
<p>Well, a handsome sum that can end this imbroglio once and for all.</p>
<p>Five hundred thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Goodness!</p>
<p>Don't answer me now. Relax, talk it over.</p>
<p>Soak in the opulence of your surroundings and dream of what can be.</p>
<p>Smithers, let's go powder my nose.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Maybe we should take it and put this ugliness behind us.</p>
<p>The fish is in the pan.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I'll tell you.</p>
<p>I think he thinks I'm an idiot!</p>
<p>He's offering us this because he knows he'll lose... and have to pay us a million.</p>
<p>I feel faint.</p>
<p>$500,000! I spit on his $500,000!</p>
<p>What's happened to you? All this greediness and lying... and shifty lawyers and phony doctors!</p>
<p>Phony doctors? Hello.</p>
<p>Know what I'd settle for? The medical bills and an apology.</p>
<p>You won't even get that. Offer's expired.</p>
<p>We'll let the jury decide. Good day. Smithers, release the hounds.</p>
<p>Your Honor, I'd like to call to the stand... Mrs. Homer J. Simpson!</p>
<p>Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, so help you God?</p>
<p>Yes, I do.</p>
<p>She was taking that very seriously.</p>
<p>Oh, the truth!</p>
<p>Mrs. Simpson, does the name Julius Hibbert mean anything to you?</p>
<p>Yes, he's been our family physician and friend... ever since I became a mother.</p>
<p>He's seen us through everything with competence and loving care.</p>
<p>But wait a minute! I'm confused.</p>
<p>This court heard expert testimony from one Dr. Nick Riviera.</p>
<p>What's your opinion of him?</p>
<p>My mother said, &quot;If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything.&quot;</p>
<p>Will that hold up?</p>
<p>No, I've tried.</p>
<p>What is your opinion of Dr. Riviera?</p>
<p>And let me remind you, you're under oath!</p>
<p>To be honest... he seemed more concerned about wrapping Bart in bandages... than making him feel better.</p>
<p>And he mispronounced words like &quot;abdomen.&quot;</p>
<p>And his office was dirty!</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, I'm not sure he's a doctor.</p>
<p>And could you describe for us in your own words... Bart's &quot;intense mental anguish and suffering&quot;?</p>
<p>Well, I don't know how intense it was... but he did miss three days of school.</p>
<p>Although he doesn't like school... so that may not count as anguish.</p>
<p>It was hard on me, having him around the house.</p>
<p>Could you put a dollar amount on all these hardships?</p>
<p>We pay Bart $5 a week to take out the trash.</p>
<p>I suppose if he'd been able to do it, we might've given him the $5.</p>
<p>$5?</p>
<p>But your lawyer, assuming he is one, is asking for a million!</p>
<p>Well, we can't blame them for trying, can we?</p>
<p>Thank you, Mrs. Simpson.</p>
<p>I'm going to write a figure down.</p>
<p>It's not quite as large as the last one... but I think you'll find it fair.</p>
<p>We should take it.</p>
<p>A million dollars. My wife cost me a million dollars.</p>
<p>Would you like more macaroni and cheese?</p>
<p>A million dollars' worth, you snake-woman!</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>String beans?</p>
<p>No, you two-timing, backstabbing-- Better answer.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Celery with cream cheese?</p>
<p>Just mouth polite nothings.</p>
<p>It would've been cool to get that million.</p>
<p>Bart, please.</p>
<p>We could've bought tons of great stuff.</p>
<p>Maids, a pool, fancy sweaters. Stop me if I'm wrong.</p>
<p>Marge, may I go to Moe's for a drink?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I may never come back.</p>
<p>Good night.</p>
<p>My woman's intuition is telling me something.</p>
<p>I wonder-- Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Well, I guess this is the class I'll die in.</p>
<p>You're better off. Rich people aren't happy.</p>
<p>They think they're happy but trust me, they ain't.</p>
<p>Moe, I wish he'd shut up.</p>
<p>A chick!</p>
<p>And it's not even ladies' night.</p>
<p>Hey, guys. Knock it off! It's just my wife.</p>
<p>Well, hello.</p>
<p>My name's Marge.</p>
<p>Homer, I'd like you to forgive me for doing the right thing.</p>
<p>We've squabbled over money before. Never this much.</p>
<p>It's different than when I washed your pants with the 20 in the pocket--</p>
<p>You think this is about money? It's not. It's worse.</p>
<p>I'm afraid that when I look at you... I won't see the wife by my side or the mother of my children.</p>
<p>I'll see the dame who blew my one big chance.</p>
<p>What are you saying?</p>
<p>I'm saying--</p>
<p>She's your wife of 10 years, you've had 3 children.</p>
<p>It's time to be honest.</p>
<p>I'm not sure I love you anymore.</p>
<p>Don't worry, I won't let on. I'll still do the bed stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe it won't be so bad.</p>
<p>Oh, my Lord!</p>
<p>I don't want to wait to find out if you love me anymore.</p>
<p>I think that you should look me in the eyes and find out.</p>
<p>Homer, look at me!</p>
<p>Do it if it'll shut her up. Start with the feet. Still angry.</p>
<p>Good, Homer!</p>
<p>This is tough, need refreshment. Trustworthy beer.</p>
<p>My love for you will never die.</p>
<p>All right, look the wife straight in the eyes and tell her--</p>
<p>Who am I kidding? I love you more than ever!</p>
<p>I love you too!</p>
<p>Sorry to scare you like that, babe.</p>
<p>Okay, everybody!</p>
<p>For the next 15 minutes, one-third off on every pitcher.</p>
