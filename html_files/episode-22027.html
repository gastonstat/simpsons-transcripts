<p>D'oh! [Screams]</p>
<p>[Guffawing]</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed my one-man pie fight, kids.</p>
<p>Now it's time for another &quot;fanschmabulous&quot; episode... of <em>Itchy and Scratchy.</em></p>
<p>[Gasps]</p>
<p>[Screams]</p>
<p>[Screaming]</p>
<p>[Giggling]</p>
<p>[Sighs]</p>
<p>[Screams]</p>
<p>Kids? Kids?</p>
<p>You're missing the <em>Itchy and Scratchy Show.</em></p>
<p>Don't you like it anymore?</p>
<p>Sure. We love it.</p>
<p>But how can we watch TV when it's so beautiful out?</p>
<p>Yeah, Mom. I mean, we love you and Dad too... but God knows we don't need to see you every day.</p>
<p>An occasional hug is all I ask.</p>
<p>Mom! You can hug me when I'm asleep.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>[Screams]</p>
<p><em>[Krusty Groaning]</em></p>
<p>Hey, Krusty, you look great. You get your teeth bleached?</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a new kind of polymer treatment- Hey, shut up!</p>
<p>You're here 'cause your <em>Itchy and Scratchy</em> cartoons are stinking up my ratings!</p>
<p>Look at this breakdown of yesterday's show.</p>
<p>[Muttering] Kaboom!</p>
<p>What happened here? Lightning hit the transmitter?</p>
<p>See, that's what I thought at first, but then- Hey, shut up!</p>
<p>That crater is where your lousy cartoon crash-landed! It's ratings poison!</p>
<p>But <em>Itchy and Scratchy</em> is critically acclaimed.</p>
<p>Acclaimed? [Spits]</p>
<p>I oughta replace it right now with that Chinese cartoon... where the robots turn into blingwads!</p>
<p>But I'm a lazy, lazy man, Roger.</p>
<p>So I'll give you one more chance.</p>
<p><em>Get out!</em></p>
<p>Don't come back till you fix <em>Itchy and Scratchy.</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Okay, Mel, you can go in now.</em></p>
<p>Krusty, I've come to solicit donations for the Rock 'N' Roll Museum.</p>
<p><em>And- I'll come back later.</em></p>
<p>I need to purchase a brassiere. You kids wait over here in the credit department.</p>
<p>Oh, can't we just wander around and meet you back here later?</p>
<p>Mmm, okay. Just be careful.</p>
<p>Would you kids like to come with me?</p>
<p>Sounds good to me. Let's go.</p>
<p>Okay. I guess so.</p>
<p><em>All right, thanks for participating in our focus group, kids.</em></p>
<p>Today we're gonna show you some <em>Itchy and Scratchy</em> cartoons.</p>
<p>[All Cheering]</p>
<p>Cool!</p>
<p>We want you to tell us what you think.</p>
<p>And be honest, because no one from the show is here spying on you.</p>
<p><em>[Man Sneezes]</em></p>
<p>Why is that mirror sneezing?</p>
<p>Uh, look, it's just an old, creaky mirror.</p>
<p>You know, sometimes it sounds a little like it's sneezing... or coughing or talking softly.</p>
<p>Now, you each have a knob in front of you.</p>
<p>When you like what you see, turn the knob to the right.</p>
<p>[Beeps]</p>
<p>When you don't like what you see, turn it left.</p>
<p>[Buzzes]</p>
<p>My knob tastes funny.</p>
<p>Please refrain from tasting the knob.</p>

<p>[Knobs Beeping]</p>
<p>[Grunting]</p>
<p>[Knob Beeping]</p>
<p>Hey, quit it!</p>
<p>[All Laughing]</p>
<p>They like Itchy. They like Scratchy.</p>
<p>One kid seems to love the Speedo man. What more do they want?</p>
<p>Okay, how many of you kids would like Itchy and Scratchy... to deal with real-life problems like the ones you face every day?</p>
<p>[All Shouting]</p>
<p>Great idea! Yeah, that's it!</p>
<p>And who would like to see them do just the opposite- getting into far-out situations involving robots and magic powers?</p>
<p>[All Shouting]</p>
<p>So you want a realistic, down-to-earth show... that's completely off-the-wall and swarming with magic robots?</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>Yeah, good.</p>
<p>And also you should win things by watching.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>You kids don't know what you want.</p>
<p>That's why you're still kids- 'cause you're stupid!</p>
<p>Just tell me what's wrong with the freakin' show!</p>
<p>[Crying]</p>
<p>[Buzzing]</p>
<p>Mommy!</p>
<p>Um, excuse me, sir.</p>
<p>The thing is, there's not really anything wrong with the <em>Itchy and Scratchy Show.</em></p>
<p>It's as good as ever. But after so many years... the characters just can't have the same impact they once had.</p>
<p>That's it. That's it, little girl!</p>
<p>You saved Itchy and Scratchy!</p>
<p>Please sign these papers indicating that you did not save Itchy and Scratchy.</p>
<p>Please sign these papers indicating that you did not save Itchy and Scratchy.</p>
<p>I have figured out how to rejuvenate the show.</p>
<p>It is so simple, you egghead writers would've never thought of it.</p>
<p>What we need is... a new character!</p>
<p>One that today's kids can relate to!</p>
<p>Are you absolutely sure that's wise, sir?</p>
<p>I mean, I don't want to sound pretentious here... but Itchy and Scratchy comprise a dramaturgical dyad.</p>
<p>Hey, this ain't art! It's business!</p>
<p>What do ya got in mind? Sexy broad? Gangster octopus?</p>
<p>No. No. The animal chain of command goes... mouse, cat, dog.</p>
<p>D-O-G.</p>
<p>Uh, a dog? Isn't that a tad predictable?</p>
<p>In your dreams. We're talking the original dog from hell.</p>
<p>You mean Cerberus?</p>
<p>We at the network want a dog with attitude.</p>
<p>He's edgy. He's in your face.</p>
<p>You've heard the expression &quot;let's get busy.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, this is a dog who gets &quot;biz-zay.&quot;</p>
<p>Consistently and thoroughly.</p>
<p>So he's proactive, huh?</p>
<p>Oh, God, yes.</p>
<p>We're talking about a totally outrageous paradigm.</p>
<p>Excuse me, but &quot;proactive&quot; and &quot;paradigm&quot;- aren't these just buzzwords that dumb people use to sound important?</p>
<p>Not that I'm accusing you of anything like that.</p>
<p>I'm fired, aren't I?</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>The rest of you writers start thinking up a name for this funky dog.</p>
<p>I don't know. Something along the lines of, say, Poochie.</p>
<p>Only more proactive.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p><em>[Door Slams]</em></p>
<p>So, Poochie okay with everybody?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, it's good.</p>
<p><em>No, no, no.</em></p>
<p>He was supposed to have attitude!</p>
<p>Um, wh-wh-what do you mean exactly?</p>
<p>Oh, you know, attitude! Attitude! Uh, sunglasses!</p>
<p>Can we put him in more of a hip-hop context?</p>
<p>Forget context. He's gotta be a surfer. Give me a nice schmear of surfer.</p>
<p>I feel we should &quot;rastafy&quot; him by 10% or so.</p>
<p>Hmm. I think he needs a little more attitude.</p>
<p><em>Oh, yeah, bingo! There it is right there!</p>
<p>Yeah, that works.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>I love it.</em></p>
<p>Hey, Lise, look. They're adding a new character to <em>Itchy and Scratchy.</em></p>
<p>Poochie the Dog?</p>
<p>Adding a new character is often a desperate attempt to boost low ratings.</p>
<p>Yo, yo. How's it hangin', everybody?</p>
<p>Morning, Roy.</p>
<p>Yeah, hi, Roy.</p>
<p>Hey, they're having open casting for the voice of Poochie.</p>
<p>You should try out, Dad. You have a funny voice.</p>
<p>I do not!</p>
<p>Haven't you ever listened to yourself on a tape recorder?</p>
<p>I prefer to listen to Cheap Trick.</p>
<p>Well, here. Say something.</p>
<p>Hey, this is Homer Simpson saying howdy... to all the girls out there in radio land.</p>
<p>[Rewinding]</p>
<p>Hey, this is Homer Simpson saying-</p>
<p>[Screams]</p>
<p>I don't sound like that, do I?</p>
<p>Oh, I don't like having such a hilarious voice.</p>
<p>That hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom.</p>
<p>Whoa! A talking dog.</p>
<p>[Laughs] What were you guys smokin' when you came up with that?</p>
<p>We were eating rotisserie chicken. Can you just read the line, please?</p>
<p>Ruff, ruff. I'm Poochie, the rockin' dog.</p>
<p>You're perfect! In fact, you're better than perfect!</p>
<p>Next to you, perfection is crap!</p>
<p>Ruff, ruff. I'm Poochie, the rockin' dog.</p>
<p>Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such cartoons as...</p>
<p><em>Christmas Ape</em> and <em>Christmas Ape Goes to Summer Camp.</em></p>
<p>You're even better than this guy.</p>
<p>Take a hike, you bum.</p>
<p>[Groans]</p>
<p>[Clears Throat] Ruff, ruff. I'm Poochie, the rockin' dog.</p>
<p>Now, that's just bad. You got no attitude, you're barely outrageous... and I don't know what you're in, but it's not my face.</p>
<p>Next.</p>
<p>Oh, no attitude, eh? Not in your face, huh?</p>
<p>Well, you can cram it with walnuts, ugly!</p>
<p>That's it! That's the Poochie attitude! Do that again.</p>
<p>Huh? I can't. I don't remember what I did.</p>
<p>Then you don't get the job. Next.</p>
<p>Oh, I don't get the job, do I? Well, boo-hoo!</p>
<p>I don't get to be a cartoon dog!</p>
<p>That's it! You've got the job!</p>
<p>Oh, now I got the job, huh? Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>Okay, Homer, let's get a level check on your voice.</p>
<p>She smells sheet smells by the sheet &quot;shtore.&quot;</p>
<p>Wait. Wait. Let me try it again.</p>
<p>Relax, Homer. You'll do fine. I'm June Bellamy.</p>
<p>I do the voices of Itchy and Scratchy.</p>
<p>You? But you're a lady.</p>
<p>[Itchy's Voice] She's a lady all right.</p>
<p>[Scratchy's Voice] A beautiful lady.</p>
<p>[Laughing] Hey, that really is you!</p>
<p>How'd you get to be so good?</p>
<p>Oh, just experience, I suppose.</p>
<p>I started out as Roadrunner. &quot;Meep.&quot;</p>
<p>You mean &quot;meep-meep&quot;?</p>
<p>No. They only paid me to say it once.</p>
<p>Then they doubled it up on the soundtrack. Cheap bastards.</p>
<p>You folks ready to begin?</p>
<p>Uh, I guess. Is this episode going on the air live?</p>
<p>No, Homer. Very few cartoons are broadcast live.</p>
<p>It's a terrible strain on the animators' wrists.</p>

<p>Hi. Question for Miss Bellamy.</p>
<p>In episode 2F09, when Itchy plays Scratchy's skeleton like a xylophone... he strikes the same rib twice in succession... yet he produces two clearly different tones.</p>
<p>I mean, what are we- to believe that this is some sort of a-</p>
<p>[Chuckles] a magic xylophone or something?</p>
<p>Boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder.</p>
<p>Uh, well, uh-</p>
<p>I'll field this one. Let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>Why would a man whose shirt says &quot;genius at work&quot;... spend all of his time watching a children's cartoon show?</p>
<p>I withdraw my question.</p>
<p>Uh, excuse me, Mr. Simpson.</p>
<p>On the <em>Itchy and Scratchy</em> CD-ROM... is there a way to get out of the dungeon without using the wizard key?</p>
<p>What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p>You're a lifesaver, Homer. I can't deal with these hard-core fans.</p>
<p>[Clears Throat] Your attention, please.</p>
<p><em>Uh, in episode-</em></p>
<p>Uh, your attention, please!</p>
<p>Mr. Simpson will now be autographing 8-by-10 glossies of Poochie.</p>
<p>One per customer. Please form a line.</p>
<p>There will be no cutting. I'm talking to you, Mr. Cutter.</p>
<p>Pardon me. Look out. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hot soup.</p>
<p>Hi. Kindly make one out to me... and three out to my friend of the same name.</p>
<p><em><strong>Marge</strong>: I'm so glad you couldjoin us for Homer's big premiere.</em></p>
<p>[Chattering]</p>
<p>Poochie's based on me.</p>
<p>Is this seat taken, little girl?</p>
<p>I'm not a girl! Are you blind?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I am stoked, Mr. S.</p>
<p>Shh. Everybody, it's coming on!</p>
<p>Once in a great while, we are privileged to experience a television event... so extraordinary, it becomes part of our shared heritage.</p>
<p>1969- man walks on the moon.</p>
<p>1971 - man walks on the moon... again.</p>
<p>Then for a long time, nothing happened.</p>
<p>Until tonight.</p>
<p>Behold the future of comedy. Poochie!</p>
<p>[Children Cheering]</p>
<p>♪ [Singing]</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Look, Scratchy! It's our new friend, Poochie!</p>
<p>What's that name again? I forgot.</p>
<p>♪ [Rapping]</p>
<p>Ooh, Poochie is one outrageous dude.</p>
<p>He's totally in my face.</p>
<p>♪ [Electric Guitar]</p>
<p>Wiggity, wiggity. Word up. Rock on, party.</p>
<p>When are they gonna get to the fireworks factory? [Whining]</p>
<p>Can somebody tell me what the hell is going on? Midge, help me out here.</p>
<p>Quiet! You're missing the jokes.</p>
<p><em>♪ [Rock]</em></p>
<p>Catch you on the flip side, &quot;dudemeisters.&quot; Not!</p>
<p>Hey, kids, always recycle... to the extreme!</p>
<p>Busted!</p>
<p>[Tires Screeching]</p>
<p>Ah, that stunk!</p>
<p>Well, what did everybody think?</p>
<p>[All Muttering]</p>
<p>Homer, I can honestly say that was the best episode of lmpy and Chimpy I've ever seen.</p>
<p>Yeah, you should be very proud, Homer.</p>
<p>You, uh, got a beautiful home here.</p>
<p><em>[Tires Screeching]</em></p>
<p>[Grunts]</p>
<p>So, it was pretty okay, huh?</p>
<p>Mom, can we go to bed without dinner?</p>
<p>Yes, we can.</p>
<p><em>[Door Slamming]</em></p>
<p>Well, at least I liked it. Didn't I?</p>
<p>[Thinking] Oh, you don't want to know what I really think.</p>
<p>Now, look sad and say &quot;d'oh.&quot;</p>
<p>D'oh.</p>
<p>I'm the worst Poochie ever.</p>
<p>No, it's not your fault, Dad. You did fine.</p>
<p>It's just that Poochie was a soulless by-product of committee thinking.</p>
<p>You can't be cool just by spouting a bunch of worn-out buzzwords.</p>
<p>Don't have a cow, Lise.</p>
<p>Bart's right.</p>
<p>Let's none of us have a cow.</p>
<p>All that matters is that the fans of the show liked it.</p>
<p>Last night's <em>Itchy and Scratchy</em> was, without a doubt... the worst episode ever!</p>
<p>Rest assured that I was on the lnternet within minutes... registering my disgust throughout the world.</p>
<p>Hey, I know it wasn't great, but what right do you have to complain?</p>
<p>As a loyal viewer, I feel they owe me.</p>
<p>What? They've given you thousands of hours of entertainment for free.</p>
<p>What could they possibly owe you? I mean, if anything, you owe them.</p>
<p>Worst episode ever.</p>
<p>It looks like the beginning of the end for the venerable <em>Itchy and Scratchy</em> program.</p>
<p>For years, TV critics such as yours truly, Kent Brockman... have waited impatiently for cracks to appear in the show's hilarious facade.</p>
<p>Yesterday our prayers were finally answered... when Poochie the Dog made his howlingly unfunny debut.</p>
<p>Far be it from me to gloat in another's downfall... but I have a feeling no children are gonna be crying... when this puppy is put to sleep. [Laughing]</p>
<p>[Cries] What the hell happened?</p>
<p>Well, I'd attribute the product failure... to fundamental shifts in our key demographic... coupled with the overall crumminess of Poochie.</p>
<p>[Cries] Oh, you gotta stop this thing!</p>
<p>[Crying] Please! I'm gettin' egged on the street!</p>
<p>Do somethin'! Do somethin'!</p>
<p>[Crying Continues]</p>
<p><em>[Knocking]</em></p>
<p>Uh, hi, Mr. Meyers.</p>
<p>I've been doing some thinking, and I got some ideas to improve the show.</p>
<p>I got it right here.</p>
<p>Uh, one: Poochie needs to be louder, angrier and have access to a time machine.</p>
<p>Two: Whenever Poochie's not on screen... all the other characters should be asking, &quot;Where's Poochie?&quot;</p>
<p>Three-</p>
<p>Great. Great.</p>
<p>Just leave them right there on the floor on your way out.</p>
<p><em>[Chattering]</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Okay, so, anyway-</em></p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p><em>[Chattering Continues]</em></p>
<p>Listen, guys, we've gotta do something about Poochie.</p>
<p><em><strong>Krusty</strong>: There's only one thing we can do.</em></p>
<p>Then they said they were gonna k*ll Poochie off.</p>
<p>Really? Oh, how terrible.</p>
<p>Yes, terrible.</p>
<p>It's not your fault, Homer. It's those lousy writers.</p>
<p>They make me madder than a, um, yak in heat!</p>
<p>You're right, Marge. It's not my fault.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna let 'em treat Poochie like dirt anymore just because he's the new guy.</p>
<p>Right on, Mr. S.</p>
<p>Put a sock in it, Roy.</p>
<p>Okay, so here's where Itchy lunges at Poochie... with a rusty chain saw.</p>
<p>Cue sound effects.</p>
<p><em>[Chain Saw Sound]</em></p>
<p>Rustier!</p>
<p><em>[Rustier Sound]</em></p>
<p>[Itchy's Voice] Are you prepared to die, Poochie?</p>
<p>No, I am not.</p>
<p>Oh, cut, cut, cut, cut.</p>
<p>Just stick to the script as written, Homer.</p>
<p>You're supposed to say, &quot; Please cut off my head. I don't deserve to live.&quot;</p>
<p>Never!</p>
<p>[All Gasping, Muttering]</p>
<p>You can't just k*ll off a classic TV character.</p>
<p>Poochie could be bigger than curly fries.</p>
<p>But first he has to win back the audience.</p>
<p>That's why I'm gonna read these lines I wrote myself with my own two hands.</p>
<p>Forget it, Homer! We can do this show without you if we have to.</p>
<p>But not without me.</p>
<p>Oh, geez!</p>
<p>Let him try the new lines.</p>
<p>All right. All right. We'll try them. Action.</p>
<p>[Itchy's Voice] Hi, Poochie. You look like you've got something to say.</p>
<p>Do you?</p>
<p>Yes, I certainly do.</p>
<p>Hello there, Itchy.</p>
<p>I know there's a lot of people who don't like me and wish I would go away... and I think we got off on the wrong foot.</p>
<p>I know I can come off a little proactive, and for that I'm sorry.</p>
<p><em>But if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog nobody wanted...</em></p>
<p>I know we can make 'em laugh... and cry till we grow old together.</p>
<p>And... cut.</p>
<p>Now, kids, I know you loved the old Poochie...</p>
<p><em>but the new one's gonna be better than 10 Super Bowls!</em></p>
<p>I don't wanna oversell it. Judge for yourself.</p>
<p>[Screams] Well, look who's here.</p>
<p>Hi, Poochie! You look like you've got something to say.</p>
<p>Do you?</p>
<p>Yes, I certainly do.</p>
<p>[Man's Voice] I have to go now. My planet needs me.</p>
<p>♪ [Organ]</p>
<p><em>Wow! Poochie came from another planet?</em></p>
<p>Uh, I guess.</p>
<p>Hey, that wasn't supposed to happen!</p>
<p>Those finks double-crossed me!</p>
<p>Poochie's dead! [Guffawing]</p>
<p>[Cheering]</p>
<p>Well, kids, we all know that sometimes when cartoon characters die... they're back again the very next week.</p>
<p>That's why I'm presenting this sworn affidavit... that Poochie will never, ever, ever return!</p>
<p>This document conforms to all applicable laws and statutes.</p>
<p>[Children Cheering]</p>
<p>Oh, yeah!</p>
<p>[TV Switches Off]</p>
<p>Tough break, Dad. I guess people just weren't ready for Poochie.</p>
<p>Maybe in a few years.</p>
<p>Good news, everybody.</p>
<p>I'm movin' into my own apartment with two sexy ladies.</p>
<p>Oh, then I guess this is good-bye, Roy.</p>
<p>Maybe we'll see you in a few years.</p>
<p>[Clicks Tongue]</p>
<p>Well, I guess I learned my lesson.</p>
<p>The thing is, I lost creative control of the project.</p>
<p>And I forgot to ask for any money.</p>
<p>Well, live and learn.</p>
<p>♪ [Instrumental]</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>[Screaming]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] It's back to the basics- classic</em> Itchy and Scratchy.</p>
<p>We should thank our lucky stars they're still putting on... a program of this caliber after so many years.</p>
<p>What else is on?</p>
<p>[Murmuring]</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
