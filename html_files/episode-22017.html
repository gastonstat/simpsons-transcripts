<p>[Tires Screeching]</p>
<p>D'oh! [Screams]</p>
<p>What a perfect outing for a beautiful autumn day.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for everyone who's cooped up inside... watching the seventh game of the World Series.</p>
<p>Yeah, they won't learn anything about apples today.</p>
<p>And the cider mill operated continuously until 1941... when its workers left to fight in the Second World w*r.</p>
<p>When they returned, the old girl was just as they'd left her... only now she was infested with thousands upon thousands of rats.</p>
<p>[All Gasping, Reacting]</p>
<p>Right. And if you listen real carefully... you can still hear them gnawing away at the apples... and splashing around in the toilets.</p>
<p>And that concludes this portion of the tour.</p>
<p><em>[Change Rattling]</p>
<p>One of the most historically significant fruit presses... in this part of the state-</em></p>
<p>[Sighs]</p>
<p><em>was based on a German design, but modified for the larger American apple.</em></p>
<p>Well, if God didn't make little green apples, it's Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>How long have you been here?</p>
<p>Twenty of the suckiest minutes of my life.</p>
<p>Oh, sucking down the cider, huh? Hey, word to the wise- season pass.</p>
<p>Pays for itself after the 16th visit.</p>
<p>You know, most people don't know the difference... between apple cider and apple juice.</p>
<p>But I do. Now, here's a little trick to help you remember.</p>
<p>If it's clear and yella, you've got juice there, fella.</p>
<p>If it's tangy and brown, you're in cider town.</p>
<p><em>Now, there's two exceptions and it gets kind of- [Fades]</em></p>
<p>[Homer Thinking] Oh! You can stay, but I'm leaving.</p>
<p><em>[Continues, Indistinct]</em></p>
<p>And of course in Canada, the whole thing's flip-flopped.</p>
<p>Oh, my! I better get you some cider.</p>
<p>Next to spring and winter, fall is my absolute favorite season.</p>
<p>Just look at all this beautiful &quot;foilage.&quot;</p>
<p>It's not &quot;foilage,&quot; Mom. It's foliage. Foliage.</p>
<p>That's what I said- &quot;foilage.&quot;</p>
<p>It doesn't take a &quot;nucular&quot; scientist to pronounce &quot;foilage.&quot;</p>
<p><em>[Wind Whistling]</em></p>
<p>Honestly, Smithers, I don't know why Harvard even bothers to show up.</p>
<p>They barely even won.</p>
<p>Their cheating was even more rampant than last year, sir.</p>
<p>Well, I say let Harvard have its football and academics.</p>
<p>Yale will always be first in gentlemanly club life.</p>
<p>Why, every friend I have, I made right here.</p>
<p>Hello, Burnsie. It's your old roomy, Dink.</p>
<p>[Shudders]</p>
<p>[Pool Chalk Squeaking]</p>
<p>Steady. Steady.</p>
<p>Oh, nicely played, sir.</p>
<p><em>[Man On P.A.] Attention, passengers.</em></p>
<p>The train has been temporarily delayed... because of a discarded couch on the tracks.</p>
<p>Yes, it looks like some sort of a couch.</p>
<p>Oh, this may take a while, Smithers.</p>
<p>Why don't you get drunk and stumble around comically for my amusement?</p>
<p>I'll be a one-man conga line.</p>
<p>[Snoring]</p>
<p>Ah, customers. Thank God. Papa needs a new pair of everything.</p>
<p>Hey, how you doing? Welcome to scenic Waynesport.</p>
<p>And remember your visit with a googly-eyed walnut.</p>
<p>How about a googly-eyed rock? Some nice local squash candy?</p>
<p>A stressed-out Pepsi bottle? Come on.</p>
<p>If this stuff is too nice for you, I've got some crap.</p>
<p>♪ [Humming] Oh, oh!</p>
<p><em>[Train Whistle Blows]</em></p>
<p>Hey, Casey Jones, where's this train headed?</p>
<p>Springfield.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. What state?</p>
<p>[Continues, Indistinct]</p>
<p>[Train Whistle Blows]</p>
<p>I can honestly say that was the most fun I've ever had.</p>
<p>The mill, the history, all that gorgeous <em>foliage.</em></p>
<p>I can't &quot;exscape&quot; Lisa, our little walking &quot;libary.&quot;</p>
<p>Can't they get a pole for that sign?</p>
<p>That's a hitchhiker, Homer.</p>
<p>Ooh, let's pick him up.</p>
<p>No. What if he's crazy?</p>
<p>And what if he's not? Then we'd look like idiots.</p>
<p>We're not picking him up.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, we are.</p>
<p>There's not enough room.</p>
<p>Yes, there is.</p>
<p>I just don't think it's a good idea.</p>
<p>And I think it's the best idea I've ever had.</p>
<p>We're picking up the weirdo, and that's final.</p>
<p><em>[Tires Squeal]</em></p>
<p>Hey, you folks are all right.</p>
<p>Man, it was rough getting a ride out there.</p>
<p>The only car that stopped was a hearse that thought I fell out.</p>
<p>It was rough, I tell you.</p>
<p>Careful of the apple pie on the seat.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Grampa, are you sitting on the pie?</p>
<p>I sure hope so.</p>
<p>Hey, I'm looking for this guy. Anybody know who he is?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure, we know him. That's Mr. Burns.</p>
<p>He tried to k*ll our puppies.</p>
<p>He sexually harassed me.</p>
<p>He stole my fiancée.</p>
<p>He made fun of my weight.</p>
<p>Okay, so there's been a little friction. Know his address?</p>
<p>Whoa! This guy's got more bread than a prison meat loaf.</p>
<p>He's rich, I tell ya. I never seen a place with a walk-in mailbox.</p>
<p>Hey, who am I talking to?</p>
<p><em>[Doorbell Rings]</em></p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, hi. My-My name is Larry. I'm here to see Mr. Burns.</p>
<p>Well, I hate to break it to you, Larry... but if Mr. Burns ever wants to see a stranger... he will observe him through a powerful telescope.</p>
<p>Now, if you-</p>
<p>Smithers, what's going on?</p>
<p>How dare you interrupt my lime rickey?</p>
<p>[Slurping, Sighs] State your business.</p>
<p>Well, geez! I'm a little nervous here. What I'm trying to say is I'm-</p>
<p>You're what? Selling light bulbs? Worried about the whales?</p>
<p>Keen on Jesus? Out with it!</p>
<p>Well, Mr. Burns, I'm your son.</p>
<p>Oh, and I stepped on one of your peacocks. You got a paper towel?</p>
<p>It's true. He is my son.</p>
<p>Hey, now you're talking!</p>
<p>Good God.</p>
<p>Ah, Pop, don't get me wrong. It's great to be here.</p>
<p>But how's a guy like you wind up with a son like me?</p>
<p>Ah, Larry, my lad, I've gone over this story in my mind a million times.</p>
<p>It was 1941, the-</p>
<p>No, '39, my 25th Yale reunion.</p>
<p><em>[Burns Narrating] Who should appear but the unrequited love of my college years-</p>
<p>Mimsie Bankcroft.</p>
<p>Of course by then, Mimsie had her share of wrinkles... and a gray hair or two, but my adoring eyes saw past those minor imperfections... to her 21-year-old daughter, Lily.</p>
<p>I took Lily to the local &quot;cinematorium'... where our passions were inflamed by Clark Gable's reckless use of the word &quot;damn. '&quot;</p>
<p>We sneaked into the nearby Peabody Museum.</p>
<p>There, under the smiling eyes of four stuffed Eskimos... we expressed our love physically... as was the style at the time.</em></p>
<p>[Guffaws]</p>
<p>Well, how do you like that? I have been in a museum.</p>
<p>What happened with you and Ma?</p>
<p>There was a terrible scandal.</p>
<p>Lily's family forced her to give you up... and bundled her off to a convent in the South Seas.</p>
<p>I never heard from her again.</p>
<p>But I prattle on. Tell me everything about your life.</p>
<p>Oh, what's to tell? I was at the orphanage till I was 18.</p>
<p>Then I got my job at the souvenir stand.</p>
<p>Oh, and once I saw a blimp.</p>
<p>Well, you must be tired.</p>
<p>Let me show you your room.</p>
<p>Oh, is this posh!</p>
<p>Ah, Pop, nobody's ever been so nice to me.</p>
<p>Yes, yes. All right.</p>
<p>Uh-huh. It's good to see you too.</p>
<p>Now then, in case you get bored, here's the playroom.</p>
<p>You can't just eat the orange and throw the peel away!</p>
<p>A man's not a piece of fruit!</p>
<p>This show was supposed to close last week!</p>
<p>Close this show! Close it, I say.</p>
<p>Hey, don't worry about it. You're all right.</p>
<p><em>[Bird Squawks]</em></p>
<p>[Snoring, Mumbles]</p>
<p>[Snoring]</p>
<p>[Both Scream]</p>
<p>Hey, you're that hitchhiker. What are you doing here?</p>
<p>Learning the family business. I'm Larry Burns, the boss's son.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Oh, relax. I don't wanna work.</p>
<p>I'm so lazy I took lessons on a player piano.</p>
<p>Wow! That's really lazy.</p>
<p>Lazy, you're not kidding. Why, I'm like a rug on Valium. I'm talking lazy.</p>
<p>So lazy.</p>
<p><em>And Larry and I have so much in common, Marge, way more than you and me.</em></p>
<p>If I could be stranded on an island with anyone, it would definitely be Larry.</p>
<p>I think we've heard enough about Larry Burns for one evening.</p>
<p>Why? It's not like anything interesting happened to anyone else today.</p>
<p><em>♪ [Ballroom]</em></p>
<p>[Chattering, Laughing]</p>
<p>Hey, Pop, this crowd is pretty swanky.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna fit in here.</p>
<p>Nonsense, Larry.</p>
<p>Your bl*od is bluer than any of theirs.</p>
<p>Just give them a snootful of the old Burns charm.</p>
<p>Oh, Admiral Carstairs, I'd like you to meet my son, Larry.</p>
<p>Hey, Skipper, good to meet you.</p>
<p>Where'd you start out, on the <em>Merrimack?</em></p>
<p>Hey, I should talk. I hope I look that good when I'm 200.</p>
<p>That's such insubordination!</p>
<p>Larry, please.</p>
<p>He's very sensitive about his age.</p>
<p>Oh, Monty, this must be the son I've heard so much about.</p>
<p>Larry, you must meet our daughter, the debutante. She came out last spring.</p>
<p>Whoa! Put her back in! She's not done yet.</p>
<p>[Scoffs]</p>
<p>Smithers, there's something a bit odd about young Larry.</p>
<p>I can't quite put my finger on it.</p>
<p>Well, he is a bit rough around the edges, sir.</p>
<p>One might blame his truly heroic intake of cocktails.</p>
<p>Pull up a seat, Pop. You too, Chuckles.</p>
<p>I mean, the food ain't great, but the portions are terrific.</p>
<p>Hey, I'm kidding. Relax. Hey, give my regards to Mrs. Boyardee.</p>
<p>[Shudders] A total lack of refinement.</p>
<p>Smithers, send for the boys at Yale admissions, hmm?</p>
<p>Well, did you meet Larry?</p>
<p>Oh, yes. He made light of my weight problem... then suggested my motto should be &quot;Semper Fudge.&quot;</p>
<p>At that point he told me to &quot;relax.&quot;</p>
<p>How were his test scores?</p>
<p>Let's just say this- he spelled &quot;Yale&quot; with a six.</p>
<p>I see. Well, l-</p>
<p>Oh, you know, I just remembered it's time for my annual donation.</p>
<p>I wonder how much I should give.</p>
<p>Well, frankly, test scores like Larry's would call for a very generous contribution.</p>
<p>For example, a score of 400 would require a donation of new football uniforms.</p>
<p>Three hundred- a new dormitory.</p>
<p>And in Larry's case, we would need an international airport.</p>
<p>Yale could use an international airport, Mr. Burns.</p>
<p>Are you mad? I'm not made of airports! Get out!</p>
<p>Summon my son at once.</p>
<p>Uh, it appears he's gone drinkin', sir.</p>
<p>[Scoffs]</p>
<p>Everybody, go nuts. I'm buyin'!</p>
<p>Hey, handsome, send the bill to my dad.</p>
<p>Okay, but the last guy who charged a drink to Burns turned up in a landfill.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it was worth it. [Burps]</p>
<p>Hey, what's everybody in this burg have against my dad?</p>
<p>He's a pussycat. I tell you, he's a doll-baby.</p>

<p>Ah, this is some party. If it gets any livelier, a funeral's gonna break out.</p>
<p>Quiet, you. Nobody likes a comedian.</p>
<p>Geez! Come on, Dad, we got company. Make with the yakety-yak-yak.</p>
<p>Oh, yakety-yak-yak.</p>
<p>You, food bag, do you have a son?</p>
<p>Yes, sir, I do.</p>
<p>And is he a constant disappointment?</p>

<p>Oh, all the time. Have you ever heard of this kid Milhouse?</p>
<p>He's a little wiener who-</p>
<p>Fascinating. Good night.</p>
<p>Dad, what's with you tonight? I mean, I'm getting frostbite over here.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what's with me- the humiliation of having a coarse, boorish ignoramus for a son.</p>
<p>Uh, I should go.</p>
<p>What's the matter, Pop? Don't you love me anymore?</p>
<p><em>[Door Slams Shut]</em></p>
<p>Oh. [Grumbling]</p>
<p>Geez! Dad and I, we started out great... but now it's falling apart, like a Chinese motorcycle.</p>
<p>It's so unfair. You're everything a dad could hope for.</p>
<p>Yeah. I tell ya, I don't get no regard.</p>
<p>No regard at all. No esteem either.</p>
<p>Larry, there's only one sure way to make him realize how much he loves you... and that is a phony kidnapping.</p>
<p>Yeah, right. I don't know. Maybe I should just leave town.</p>
<p>Phony kidnapping.</p>
<p>Nah. I know what I gotta do.</p>
<p>I gotta clean up my act. No more joking around all the time.</p>
<p>No more slacking off at work. And most important, no more booze.</p>
<p><em>[Glass Breaks]</em></p>
<p>I know I can do it.</p>
<p>&quot;Your son has been kidnapped.&quot;</p>
<p>I can't believe someone would kidnap my Larry.</p>
<p>I won't rest until he's returned to me.</p>
<p>Not to be impertinent, sir... but didn't you want Larry out of your life as recently as two hours ago?</p>
<p>It's the principle, Smithers. Nobody steals from Montgomery Burns... whether it be my Sunday newspaper or my loutish oaf of a son.</p>
<p>All right, Mr. B., when the kidnappers call with the ransom demand... you tell them you'll leave the money under the big net in the park.</p>
<p>And then down comes the net. Right, Chief?</p>
<p>Hey, I like it. I like it a lot.</p>
<p><em>[Birds Twittering]</em></p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>

<p>Hiding out?</p>
<p>[Raspberry] Marge, you've been reading too many &quot;hide out&quot; books.</p>
<p>And what's that hitchhiker doing here?</p>
<p>Is every drifter we meet going to move in with us?</p>
<p>Of course not. We'll decide that on a drifter-by-drifter basis.</p>
<p>He's not a drifter, Mom. That's Mr. Burns's son, Larry.</p>
<p>He's great at pointing out everyone's foibles.</p>
<p>Hey! How you doing? Ooh, look at your hair.</p>
<p>What happened? You saw yourself in a mirror?</p>
<p>He's kidding, Mom. But, seriously, I'd love to have hair like yours.</p>
<p>I just can't get the zoning permits.</p>
<p>Hey, that reminds me, Mom. Buckingham Palace called. They want their hat back.</p>
<p>[Groans]</p>
<p>Hey, kids, how about a hand for your mom? She's all right.</p>
<p>Yeah, Mom!</p>
<p>All right, Mom!</p>

<p>[Ringing]</p>
<p>Ahoy, hoy?</p>
<p>Hello, Mr. Burns. This is the kidnapper.</p>
<p>[Chuckling]</p>
<p>Do you miss your son?</p>
<p>Yes, I'm missing one son. Return it immediately.</p>
<p>If you really love Larry, prove it, and you can have him back today.</p>
<p>Whoa! How much proof do you need?</p>
<p>Five thousand, six thousand? I swear, that's all I've got.</p>
<p>Don't you care about your son? This is more important than money.</p>
<p>More important than money? Who is this?</p>
<p>Uh- Uh, just a second.</p>
<p>[Dial Tone]</p>
<p>Beautiful. Eddie, did you trace the phone number?</p>
<p>Sure did, Chief.</p>
<p>555-</p>
<p>Oh, geez, that's gotta be phony.</p>
<p>Hey, I think I got a pai gow.</p>
<p>[Groans] I hate pai gow! Can't we just play &quot;quang jong&quot;?</p>
<p>Can't we just go upstairs?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>This is Kent Brockman in Chopper Copter 6 with a special report.</p>
<p>Montgomery Burns's son has been kidnapped.</p>
<p>Kidnapped?</p>
<p>Marge, it's not a real kidnapping.</p>
<p>It's a simple hoax to win a father's love.</p>
<p>You know how I feel about hoaxes.</p>
<p>Still?</p>
<p>I want you to take Larry back to Mr. Burns right now... before you get in a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>What, but, but-</p>
<p>Marge, it's broad daylight, and there's cops everywhere.</p>
<p>No excuses. Just do it.</p>
<p>[Groans]</p>
<p>Of course, we'll bring you updates just as soon as they-</p>
<p>Oh, wait a minute! There they are, Larry Burns and his kidnapper.</p>
<p>[Screams]</p>
<p>Appearing in broad daylight with police everywhere, ladies and gentlemen... there's only one word for that- idiocy.</p>
<p>[Groans]</p>
<p>[Tires Squealing]</p>
<p>[Sirens Wailing]</p>
<p>We gotta find someplace to hide.</p>
<p>[Gasps] The abandoned warehouse!</p>
<p>D'oh! Stupid economic recovery.</p>
<p><em>[Bell On Door Jingles]</em></p>
<p>Hey! Buy a costume or get out, fellas.</p>
<p>We gotta find someplace no one will ever go.</p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p><em>[Tires Squealing]</p>
<p>[Child] Drive faster, Grandma!</p>
<p>Grandma's gaining on us!</em></p>
<p>[Chuckles] They'll never look for us here.</p>
<p>Yeah, this place is emptier than a Scottish pay toilet.</p>
<p><em>Shh. Some people are trying to watch the movie.</em></p>
<p>You don't like it, call a cop.</p>
<p>[Whimpers]</p>
<p>[Laughing]</p>
<p>[Both Laughing]</p>
<p>[Sirens Wailing]</p>
<p>This is Kent Brockman live from the Aztec Theater... where police have learned that kidnapper Homer Simpson... and hostage, Larry Burns, are inside talking loudly.</p>
<p>Ooh, give yourself up, Homie!</p>
<p>No, Dad! sh**t your way out!</p>
<p>[Groans]</p>
<p>[Grunts]</p>
<p><em>[g*n]</em></p>
<p>[All Screaming]</p>
<p>[Kent Brockman] A bloody end for Homer Simpson... is just one of several possible outcomes, according to our computer simulation.</p>
<p>Now, here's how it would look if the police k*ll him with a barrage of baseballs.</p>
<p>We've gotta go down there and help Dad.</p>
<p><em>[Baseballs Thudding]</p>
<p>[Homer Groaning] Oh, stop it!</em></p>
<p>Shh.</p>
<p>[Feet Sticking To Floor]</p>
<p>Still warm. They can't be far.</p>
<p>Chief!</p>
<p>[Grunts]</p>
<p>Don't be a fool, Simpson. Let the kid go.</p>
<p>The negotiations have failed. sh**t him!</p>
<p>[Cocks g*n]</p>
<p>Wait!</p>
<p>[All] Wait?</p>
<p>I mean, Homer's no kidnapper.</p>
<p>Well, he's the best friend I ever had. We faked the whole thing.</p>
<p>[Chattering]</p>
<p>I should've known. You're the only one stupid enough to kidnap you.</p>
<p>Now, get down here so I can spank you in front of this gawking rabble.</p>
<p>Smithers, take off my belt.</p>
<p>With pleasure, sir.</p>
<p>Hold on, Mr. Burns. Maybe we did fake a kidnapping.</p>
<p>But is that really such a crime?</p>
<p>All your son wanted was a little attention, a little love.</p>
<p>I'm a father myself, sir.</p>
<p>And, sure, sometimes my kids can be obnoxious...</p>
<p><em>or boring, or stinky.</em></p>
<p>But they can always count on one thing- their father's unconditional love.</p>
<p>[All] Mmm!</p>
<p>How about it, Pop?</p>
<p>I know it's tough, but can you love me for what I am?</p>
<p>[Groans]</p>
<p>Well- [Mumbles]</p>
<p>There, there, sonny boy.</p>
<p>I suppose I have been a bit-</p>
<p>Oh, no, I can't do it. It's just not me.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Larry. I can't be the family that you need.</p>
<p>Oh, that's okay. I got a wife and kids.</p>
<p>Oh, that reminds me. They're probably wondering where I went.</p>
<p>I told them I'm going for coffee. That was a week ago.</p>
<p>Well, Son, delighted to have met you.</p>
<p>It's good to know that... there's another kidney out there for me.</p>
<p>You got it, Pop. Just let me run a few pints through it first.</p>
<p>As long as everybody's here, let's party!</p>
<p>[All Cheering]</p>

<p>Who's playing that music?</p>
<p>And where is all that liquor coming from?</p>
<p>It's a party, Marge. It doesn't have to make sense.</p>
