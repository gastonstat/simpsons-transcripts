							<p><strong>Folksy announcer</strong>: Well, it's the first Saturday in September, and that means one thing in Springfield.</p>
<p>It's that time again.</p>
<p>Opening day of peewee football.</p>
<p>(OVER P.A.): And everybody's headed down to Child Soldier Field to catch all the action.</p>
<p>It all comes down to this, the first game of the year, perfect season on the line.</p>
<p>And drunks are being rolled off the field.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, your Springfield Neutrinos!</p>
<p>(CROWD CHEERING)</p>
<p><strong>Bart</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Nelson</strong>: Where'd everybody go?</p>
<p><strong>Bart</strong>: I can't see.</p>
<p>(GASPS) They over-fogged the run-in!</p>
<p>They put those kids in danger just to psych up the crowd.</p>
<p>Yeah, are you psyched up now?</p>
<p>Huh? Are you?!</p>
<p>(PLAYERS PANICKING, HELMETS CLONKING)</p>
<p>Concussions!</p>
<p>Concessions!</p>
<p>(DOOR DINGS)</p>
<p>Aah!</p>
<p>(ANXIOUS CHATTER)</p>
<p>My boy hit his head doing football!</p>
<p>I'm a doctor's wife.</p>
<p>Save my boy first!</p>
<p>My boy needs an MRI!</p>
<p>(CLAMORING) Ow!</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>Ow! Ow!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)</p>
<p>With head injury concerns on the mind, the town has shut down its peewee football program.</p>
<p>Professor, what danger does this concussion threat truly pose?</p>
<p>Uh, well, Kent, these children will need their brains unbruised for the demanding, high-tech jobs of the future: polishing and buffing our robot masters.</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>And here to defend youth football, we have... Nelson's dad.</p>
<p>Are you wearing makeup?</p>
<p>Is it worth the risk to your son's health when only .1 percent of youth football players make it to the pros?</p>
<p>You saying my boy doesn't have what it takes to play pro ball? Huh?</p>
<p>Boy, show him your moves.</p>
<p>Juke it, juke it!</p>
<p>(GRUNTING)</p>
<p>Why are you dekeing it when I said juke it?</p>
<p>Take a lap!</p>
<p>Without football, Kent, (NELSON GROANS) how are kids gonna learn character like I did, you stupid fruit-munch?</p>
<p>And what is your problem, smart-nuts?</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>Which brings us to this question: if not football, what sport is safe for our children?</p>
<p>But there are so many club sports that can eat up all our free time.</p>
<p>What about baseball?</p>
<p>(SCOFFS) Baseball...</p>
<p>Rife with steroids!</p>
<p>Then test for steroids!</p>
<p>Oh and then there'll be no home runs!</p>
<p>(ALL ARGUING) Um, I think I-I may have a solution.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>What about biathlon?</p>
<p>That teaches kids to ski and k*ll.</p>
<p>How about Frisbee-golf?</p>
<p>If I could just have your attention...</p>
<p>Hey, what about Filipino tooth-fighting?</p>
<p>It builds biting, jaw strength and mouth work.</p>
<p>The champion for a long time was a dog.</p>
<p>(GROANS) No one is listening to me.</p>
<p>Well, maybe no one wants to hear your ridiculous idea.</p>
<p>Let's go, we're late for prenatal yoga.</p>
<p>Milhouse is ten.</p>
<p>Why are we still doing that?</p>
<p>Poor Kirk.</p>
<p>No one listens to him.</p>
<p>Even Luann treats him like garbage.</p>
<p>(SIGHS) Love's funny like that.</p>
<p>Help him out.</p>
<p>Make people listen to his idea.</p>
<p>Oh, why me?</p>
<p>I only came to this concert because I was told it was a potluck.</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>(ARGUING CONTINUES)</p>
<p>Attention, smothering parents who only came to hear themselves talk!</p>
<p>You're an idiot! (ARGUING QUIETS)</p>
<p>This guy has as much right to bore us as any of you!</p>
<p>Take it away, buddy.</p>
<p>(ECHOING): Buddy, buddy, buddy...</p>
<p>&quot;Buddy.&quot; Huh.</p>
<p>Um, I've got an exciting sport that's great exercise a-and teaches teamwork.</p>
<p>Lacrosse.</p>
<p>La-what?</p>
<p>What-cross?</p>
<p>What-what?</p>
<p>Lacrosse.</p>
<p>It's the perfect combination of America's two least watched sports: soccer and hockey.</p>
<p>(MURMURING EXCITEDLY)</p>
<p>Any kid can learn to play lacrosse.</p>
<p>Even this.</p>
<p>(PARENTS GASPING)</p>
<p>This isn't a drive-in movie.</p>
<p>(PARENTS GASPING)</p>
<p>Everybody, feel free to whip stuff at my son's face.</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER AND INDISTINCT CHATTER)</p>
<p>Yarr.</p>
<p>Now hold on there.</p>
<p>Lacrosse has the second highest concussion rate, right after football.</p>
<p>(CHANTING): Safer than football!</p>
<p>Safer than football!</p>
<p>Hey, why don't we have this fruit-munch teach our kids this crazy sport?</p>
<p>Me, coach your kids?</p>
<p>Most of you won't even make eye contact when I'm weighing your yogurt.</p>
<p>I'll do it.</p>
<p>If Homer will coach with me.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>We've come too far together on this crazy ride.</p>
<p>It wouldn't feel right to do it without you... buddy.</p>
<p>(ECHOING): Buddy, buddy, buddy...</p>
<p>Mm?</p>
<p>Oh, fine, I'll coach with this guy.</p>
<p>But I promise you this: I will never stop complaining about it.</p>
<p>(CHEERING)</p>
<p>(GRUMBLING): Stupid sport I never heard of... make me wake up early on a Saturday... probably have to slice oranges...</p>
<p>Don't even know the rules because I refuse to learn 'em... my kids will probably suck at it...</p>
<p>And I'll have to kneel down on photo day, knees get all wet... despite my bad attitude, I'm thrilled by the nonstop action... kids running towards me with a look of joy I've never seen before...</p>
<p>Dad, we won!</p>
<p>It's okay, kids.</p>
<p>What matters is you tried your best.</p>
<p>Have an orange slice.</p>
<p>No, we won!</p>
<p>Yes, we're all winners.</p>
<p>Because losing teaches valuable lessons.</p>
<p>Have an orange slice.</p>
<p>We did it, buddy.</p>
<p>You and I make a great team.</p>
<p>We won for real!</p>
<p>For the first time in our lives, we can say &quot;Good game&quot; and actually mean it.</p>
<p>Good game!</p>
<p>Uh, good game!</p>
<p>Ha! That's loser talk!</p>
<p>(CHEERING)</p>
<p>(GROANING)</p>
<p>Wow, pizza really does taste sweeter after you win.</p>
<p>(HUMMING HAPPILY)</p>
<p>Dude.</p>
<p>My kids have never won at anything.</p>
<p>All the girl does is read and the boy's got one of those paying attention diseases that isn't really a disease.</p>
<p>Awesome job, guys!</p>
<p>How do you know so much about lacrosse?</p>
<p>Wait. You want to know about me?</p>
<p>(DISINTERESTED MUMBLING)</p>
<p>Well, it all goes back to my college days, where I was the star attackman on our lacrosse team.</p>
<p>(CROWD CHEERING)</p>
<p>(MARCHING BAND PLAYING)</p>
<p>I'd even been drafted to play in the pros for the Milwaukee Zoom.</p>
<p>After scoring the championship-winning goal, I was on top of the world, man.</p>
<p>I was high-fiving everybody.</p>
<p>For the first time in my life, no one, and I mean no one, was leaving me hanging.</p>
<p>I was slap-happy, I couldn't stop myself, until...</p>
<p>I highed one five too far.</p>
<p>(METALLIC CLANK) (WRIST SHATTERING)</p>
<p>Our school mascot, Sir Gudge-a-lot.</p>
<p>(RETCHING)</p>
<p>My Zoom dream died that day.</p>
<p>Mm...</p>
<p>(GRUNTS ANGRILY)</p>
<p>Uh... Ah...</p>
<p>(METALLIC CLICKING)</p>
<p>My wrist healed, but my wrist in here... never did.</p>
<p>I've never high-fived my own son.</p>
<p>The mascot wore a suit of armor?</p>
<p>Just like a knight!</p>
<p>Yeah, but now lacrosse has brought us together.</p>
<p>Hey, a toast, to new friendship!</p>
<p>Could I get a roll of toilet paper, please?</p>
<p>I get nosebleeds when I drink.</p>
<p>To... new... friendship.</p>
<p>Mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.</p>
<p>(HOMER SNORING)</p>
<p>Dad! Dad!</p>
<p>Dad! Dad!</p>
<p>Dad, wake up! Wake up! Wake up!</p>
<p>(MOANING GROGGILY)</p>
<p>Oof!</p>
<p>(MAGGIE COOS)</p>
<p>It's 6:00 a.m. on a Saturday.</p>
<p>We have a weekend lacrosse tournament!</p>
<p>(HORN HONKING OUTSIDE) There's Coach K!</p>
<p>Come on, come on, come on!</p>
<p>(BART AND LISA GRUNTING)</p>
<p>(LISA CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>(BOTH BREATHING RAPIDLY)</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: Come on, Dad!</p>
<p>(GRUNTS, GASPS)</p>
<p>Check out the travel van, brah! (CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>Two days, ten games, 700 miles and one sweet mixtape.</p>
<p>I hope you like Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, 'cause this van's about to swing.</p>
<p>♪ So I think about my next drink ♪<br />
♪ And it's you and me ♪<br />
♪ And the bottle makes three tonight ♪</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure a mixtape isn't just the same song over and over again.</p>
<p>No, no, dude, they're different live versions.</p>
<p>You can tell because some are longer.</p>
<p>(MUSIC STOPS) Hey, you want a hit off my vape pen?</p>
<p>It tastes like passionfruit and people think you're a smoker.</p>
<p>Why would I want that?</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING): Don't worry, Marge isn't here.</p>
<p>Oh, speaking of which, where is the craziest place you two have ever done it?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Let's both say it at the same time.</p>
<p>One... two...</p>
<p>Don't!</p>
<p>Chipotle!</p>
<p>There are kids back there!</p>
<p>Oh, they can't hear us.</p>
<p>I got 'em watching classic lacrosse matches.</p>
<p>(CROWD CHEERING)</p>
<p>Textbook ankle-breaker by Gary Gait!</p>
<p>And Paul Gait with the dip and dunk!</p>
<p>Everyone be sure to fuel up with a rice sandwich.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Rice in a sandwich?</p>
<p>That's mush-on-mush.</p>
<p>Doesn't this dweeb know kids need bologna to win?</p>
<p>Those sandwiches had so many carbs!</p>
<p>I've never played harder!</p>
<p>Rice power!</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>Uter, watch those alligator arms!</p>

<p>We won every game.</p>
<p>Kirk is like a sports genius who everyone hates.</p>
<p>Worse than Jim Harbaugh?</p>
<p>Well, not that bad.</p>
<p>I know Kirk's a bit of a dizzy duck, but remember, you're doing this for the kids.</p>
<p>Right, right. The kids.</p>
<p>Everything for the kids.</p>
<p>(GASPS) Oh, God, he's coming!</p>
<p>Hide, Marge.</p>
<p>Oh, good call, buddy.</p>
<p>Disco nap.</p>
<p>We got to power up for tonight. (CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>Tonight?</p>
<p>Which gentlemen's club should we hit first, Skin City or the Tassel Castle?</p>
<p>Gentlemen's... you mean a strip club?</p>
<p>Yeah, Wiggles has great dancers, but they're kind of stuck up, if you believe Lap-Aficionado.com.</p>
<p>Which, uh... (CHUCKLES) I do.</p>
<p>Why would I want to go to a strip club?</p>
<p>I'm married to a naked lady.</p>
<p>Drive time to Sapphire Diamond is only 39 minutes.</p>
<p>That's the fastest it's been all day.</p>
<p>Hey, wa... 38 minutes!</p>
<p>Listen, Kirk, I'm a lot of kind of guys...</p>
<p>A booze guy, a don't-know-my-kids'- birthdays guy, a steal-the-blow-dryer- from-the-motel guy, but I am not a strip club guy.</p>
<p>You do want to hang with me, don't you, buddy?</p>
<p>(GROANS SOFTLY)</p>
<p>I can't do it.</p>
<p>I can't pretend to be this guy's friend for one more second.</p>
<p>I scored three goals today!</p>
<p>I'm a jock. A jock!</p>
<p>I didn't spit on my hand for the post-game handshake.</p>
<p>Hey, pal, I don't like Kirk either, but look how much fun the kids' heads are having.</p>
<p>(SIGHS)</p>
<p>Of course I want to hang with you, buddy.</p>
<p>But, you know, I'm pretty tired from all those YouTube videos you showed me about whiskey making.</p>
<p>It gets its color from the barrel.</p>
<p>I know, the barrel.</p>
<p>Let's just get some sleep.</p>
<p>Well, all right.</p>
<p>Next time we can just rage twice as hard, I guess.</p>

<p>(SAD SIGH)</p>
<p><strong>Folksy announcer</strong>: Springfield, the city that lives and dies by youth lacrosse, a sport we first learned about five weeks ago.</p>
<p>And with just two hours left until face off against Capital City, the countdown clock is ticking away.</p>
<p>As always, laying out all the information you need to know, this is WXPO &quot;The Pipe.&quot;</p>
<p>(CHEERING)</p>
<p>And now the man responsible for this miracle on grass, the &quot;Priest of the Crease,&quot; &quot;The Riceman Cometh,&quot; Coach K!</p>
<p>(CONFUSED NOISES)</p>
<p>Hmm, it's not like Kirk to miss such an important pre-game rally.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, better get slicing on these oranges.</p>
<p>Where is that coach?</p>
<p>If we lose this game, I have to give the mayor of Capital City a crate of Springfield apricots.</p>
<p>We grow no apricots!</p>
<p>Kirk is missing.</p>
<p>I haven't seen him since he left home happily singing about his friendship with you.</p>
<p>(HUMMING NERVOUSLY)</p>
<p>Dad, what do you know?</p>
<p>What? Nothing!</p>
<p>I don't... oh, oh...</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>The truth is, your husband and your father is a soul-sucking loser who found out I was only pretending to be his friend for the sake of the team.</p>
<p>But, but why did he empty out our bank account, and all in one-dollar bills?</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>There's only one thing a man like Kirk wants with that many singles.</p>
<p>To hand out to the poor?</p>
<p>Worse.</p>
<p>To bring to a strip club.</p>
<p>I'll go get him.</p>
<p>I'll also get him. No, me! Me!</p>
<p>I just need to go home and put on my special sweat pants.</p>
<p>No, it's my husband's fault that Kirk has run off to that jiggle joint and only he can get him out.</p>
<p>Me?</p>
<p>But those places are filled with creeps.</p>
<p>Plus, all the chairs face the stage.</p>
<p>What if I want to have a conversation with another patron?</p>
<p>Come on, Dad, you've got to do it!</p>
<p>Without Coach K, we can't play in the championship!</p>
<p>Look at the countdown clock.</p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: Countdown clock brought to you by Ray's Steaks: When you want to raise some stakes, head over to Ray's... Steaks.</p>
<p>(CHANTING): Save Coach K! Save Coach K!</p>
<p>Save Coach K!</p>
<p>Save Coach K! Save Coach K!</p>
<p>As your wife, I'm begging you, if you ever loved me, go to that strip club.</p>
<p>(CHEERING)</p>
<p>(DOG HOWLS)</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Oh, guys.</p>
<p>(TIRES SCREECH)</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING INSIDE)</p>
<p>(ANGRY GROAN) Okay.</p>
<p>All I got to do is go in, get the pervert, and bring him back to a park full of children.</p>
<p>Hey, I'm looking for my friend.</p>
<p>Bald middle-aged guy, sad paunch, given up on life.</p>
<p>It's 10:00 in the morning.</p>
<p>Take your pick.</p>
<p>(DEPRESSED GROANING)</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>(WORRIED MOAN)</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p>Uh, no, thank you. Hey there, big guy.</p>
<p>No, thank you.</p>
<p>Happily married man with no cash coming through.</p>
<p>(PANTING)</p>
<p>Made it.</p>
<p>Nothing in this place can tempt me.</p>
<p>(MOANS)</p>
<p>Oh, baby, yes.</p>
<p>Those legs go on forever.</p>
<p>(MOANS)</p>
<p>Where are they?</p>
<p>Maybe we shouldn't have sent Homer Simpson into that den of sin.</p>
<p>(MARGE GROANS, MS. HOOVER GASPS)</p>
<p>My husband's a good man.</p>
<p>He can do this.</p>
<p>(CHEWING SOUNDS)</p>
<p>Oh, worst food I've ever had.</p>
<p>So much...</p>
<p>Is that guy still in the champagne room?</p>
<p>He hasn't slept in days.</p>
<p>He brought a cooler of rice sandwiches.</p>
<p>He says they give him energy.</p>
<p>Wait, who do I know that likes rice sandwiches?</p>
<p>(GASPS) Bart's friend's dad!</p>
<p>So anyway, they can't call it bourbon unless it's from Kentucky.</p>
<p>It's the American bourbon... He's not a loser paying for lap dances; he's a loser paying for listening.</p>
<p>Kirk, we've got to go.</p>
<p>The big game is about to start.</p>
<p>Come on... buddy?</p>
<p>Oh, now I'm your buddy again, huh?</p>
<p>Well, guess what, buddy.</p>
<p>Carmeleena and Bodacious are my true friends.</p>
<p>Nothing, nothing that we had was real.</p>
<p>Well, it was all fake.</p>
<p>But, damn it, somehow you turned our fat, lazy, loser kids into winners.</p>
<p>Kirk Van Houten, I don't like you.</p>
<p>But I respect you.</p>
<p>Respect?</p>
<p>That's the one thing you can't buy in a place like this.</p>
<p>(LOUD PEELING)</p>
<p>I've got to get to that game!</p>
<p>Hey, that's a great realization you had there, pally.</p>
<p>Now if we could just settle this up, eh?</p>
<p>$15,000?</p>
<p>12 lap-dances an hour, times three girls, times 56 hours, pole tax, glitter recycling fee.</p>
<p>It's quite a ride.</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>(MEN COUGHING, KIRK YELLS) Run!</p>
<p>(NERVOUSLY GROANING)</p>
<p>(YELLS) DJs!</p>
<p>Uh-oh, Japanese businessmen!</p>
<p>ATM with giant service fee!</p>
<p>Aw, we'll never make it to the game.</p>
<p>Our kids were depending on us and we let them down.</p>
<p>You let them down. You.</p>
<p>Did you say kids?</p>
<p>We all have kids.</p>
<p>We'd do anything for 'em.</p>
<p>(BABIES COOING, NURSERY MUSIC PLAYS)</p>
<p>Come on, working moms, let's get these dads to that game.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, kids, but your coaches aren't here.</p>
<p>You're going to have to forfeit.</p>
<p>And now to blow this whistle and make it official.</p>
<p>(GUST OF WIND, HELICOPTER BLADES SPINNING)</p>
<p>It's the Strip-a-copter!</p>
<p>I mean, it's a helicopter I've never rented before.</p>
<p>Helmet up, kids.</p>
<p>Let's win ourselves a championship.</p>
<p>Who wants orange slices?</p>
<p>(CHEERING)</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Yay!</p>
<p>No matter how bad our kids screw up the rest of their lives, they'll always have this moment.</p>
<p>Buddy, you deserve this.</p>
<p>(EXCLAIMS QUIETLY)</p>
<p>(BONES CRACKING, HOMER AND KIRK SCREAM)</p>
<p>Just because we're in traction doesn't mean this hospital room can't swing.</p>
<p>♪ So I think about my next drink ♪<br />
♪ And it's you and me and the bottle makes three tonight ♪</p>
<p>(MUFFLED GROANING)</p>
<p>♪ Yeah! ♪<br />
♪ What do you mean it's last call? ♪</p>
<p>Hey, guys, I know all you &quot;Crushin' It&quot; fans are super pumped for my latest Crush video.</p>
<p>Sorry, no contest winner this week.</p>
<p>Remember, to qualify, you have to be a subscriber and leave a comment.</p>
<p>Now, the secret to the ultimate rice sammy is to make sure the rice is really wet, li-like soaking.</p>

<p>Five words... jet fuel can't melt steel.</p>
<p>(HIGH-PITCHED SCRUBBING)</p>
<p>When I held the door for that guy and he didn't even say thank you, I just lost it!</p>
