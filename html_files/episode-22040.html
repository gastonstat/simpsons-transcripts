<p>Good Lord! The rod up that mars butt must have a rod up its butt.</p>
<p>Superintendent Chalmers, can I offer you a cup of coffee-flavored Bevarine?</p>
<p>Yes. I take it gray, with Creamium.</p>
<p>But first, before Skinner shows up, I have a secret announcement.</p>
<p>In honor of Seymour's 20th year as principal... we've decided to hold a surprise tribute Friday night.</p>
<p>It's my 20th year too.</p>
<p>[Scoffs] The teachers' lounge is for teachers, Willy.</p>
<p>[Groans, Scoffs]</p>
<p><em>[Door Slams]</em></p>
<p>And for the tribute, I need a volunteer to present an oral report... on Principal Skinner's life.</p>
<p>Miss Hoover, which one is &quot;oral&quot;?</p>
<p>Out of your mouth, Ralph. Volunteers.</p>
<p>Thank you, Lisa.</p>
<p>No, Miss Hoover. I'm Ralph.</p>
<p>I only need one volunteer, Ralph.</p>
<p>Miss Hoover, which one is &quot;one&quot;?</p>
<p>Ralph and I could do the report together.</p>
<p>It's your funeral.</p>
<p>Miss Hoover.</p>
<p>♪ [Humming]</p>
<p><em>Bart, why are you doing that?</em></p>
<p>Our class is making refreshments for Skinner's party.</p>
<p>These are in honor of his army days.</p>
<p>That explains the flags.</p>
<p>What about the dog food?</p>
<p>My theory is Skinner likes dog food.</p>
<p>[Groans] Let's bake him a cake.</p>
<p>Ooh! A fresh batch of America balls!</p>
<p>[Chomping Loudly]</p>
<p><em><strong>Woman</strong>: Seymour, tell me what time it is, now!</em></p>
<p>7:00, Friday night, Mother.</p>
<p>Time for our weekly silhouette.</p>
<p>No! Cutting out your ugly nose gives me a hand cramp!</p>
<p>Oh, but you love silhouette night.</p>
<p>And then we go through your bird book and make up silly captions-</p>
<p>Why are you all dressed up?</p>
<p>I'm sick of this house, and I'm sick of you!</p>
<p>Tonight we're going for a drive.</p>
<p>Mmm, what's so special about tonight?</p>
<p>Nothing!</p>
<p>Put on your special suit and get in the car!</p>
<p>Yes, Mother.</p>
<p>Why are we stopping at my school, Mother?</p>

<p>Oh, Mother. [Sniffles]</p>
<p>You are still the master of deception.</p>
<p>I surely am.</p>
<p>[Crowd] Ahhh.</p>
<p>&quot;So, in 1966, a brave young man named Seymour Skinner...</p>
<p><em>enlisted and shipped out to Vietnam, where he rose to become platoon sergeant. &quot;</em></p>
<p>Ralph.</p>
<p>Principal Skinner is an old man who lives at the school.</p>
<p>Lisa.</p>
<p>&quot;Sergeant Skinner was a hero.</p>
<p>He risked capture many times behind enemy lines.&quot;</p>
<p>Teacher made me go to Principal Skinner's office when I was dirty.</p>
<p>&quot;And he survived to make it back to Springfield... where he became the fine educator we salute tonight.&quot;</p>
<p>When I grow up, I wanna be a principal or a caterpillar.</p>
<p>I love you, Principal Skinner.</p>

<p>Oh, thank you. What a wonderful night... to share with the people and the town that I love.</p>
<p>I have never been happier or prouder to be Seymour Skinner.</p>
<p><em><strong>Man</strong>: You're not Seymour Skinner.</p>
<p>[Murmuring]</em></p>
<p>[Gasps] Skinner!</p>
<p>Skinner?</p>
<p>I'm Skinner.</p>
<p>Seymour? [Sobs]</p>
<p>Mother!</p>
<p>She's my mother!</p>
<p>[Murmuring]</p>
<p>Will someone remove that crazy man, please?</p>
<p>No. No. He's-</p>
<p>He's not crazy. It's true.</p>
<p>I'm- [Sighs]</p>
<p>I'm... an impostor.</p>
<p>That man is the real Seymour Skinner.</p>
<p>[Gasping, Murmuring]</p>
<p>[Thinking] Keep looking shocked and move slowly towards the cake.</p>
<p>Now, let's clear this up. Who exactly are you?</p>
<p>Sergeant Seymour Skinner, U.S. Army.</p>
<p><em>It's true. I was in his platoon.</em></p>
<p>But they said you were k*ll on that scouting mission.</p>
<p>No, just captured. It's kind of a funny story, really.</p>
<p>After five years in a secret P.O.W. camp...</p>
<p>I was sold to China for slave labor.</p>
<p>Since '77, I've been making sneakers at g*n... in a sweatshop in Huhan.</p>
<p>That's not a funny story.</p>
<p>Well, I guess you had to be there.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the U.N. shut the factory down last week... and the embassy shipped me home, and here I am.</p>
<p>So what's your story, Seymour, if that is your real name?</p>
<p>Well, obviously it isn't. My real name is Armin Tamzarian.</p>
<p>[Gasping]</p>
<p>[Laughing]</p>
<p>I'm an orphan from Capitol City, and those who recall my fight... to outlaw teenage rudeness may be shocked to learn... that I, myself, was once a street punk.</p>
<p>[Shouts]</p>
<p>[Tires Screeching]</p>
<p><em>Yeah. The way I was headed, it was just a matter of time... [Siren Wailing] before I wound up in front of a judge.</em></p>
<p>[Yells]</p>
<p>What the-</p>
<p><em>[Siren Stops]</p>
<p>They gave me a choice:</em></p>
<p>Jail, the army, or apologizing to the judge and the old lady.</p>
<p>Of course, if I'd known there was a w*r going on, I probably would've apologized.</p>
<p>[Men Shouting]</p>
<p><em>[g*n]</em></p>
<p>[Groans] Okay, who wants a piece of me?</p>
<p>You trying to get yourself k*ll, Tamzarian?</p>
<p>You've got your whole life ahead of you. Don't you have any dreams?</p>
<p>My dreams all involve combing my hair.</p>
<p>Oh, gosh, son. Everybody's got dreams.</p>
<p>I come from a town called Springfield.</p>
<p>And my dream is to go back and become principal of the elementary school.</p>
<p>Some people might call that a pretty corny dream, uh, Sergeant.</p>
<p>Well, there's nothing corny about fresh-faced youngsters skipping to school... scraping knees and spelling bees... and pies cooling softly on the windowsill. [Chuckles]</p>
<p>Well, sir, if that's corny, then corn me up.</p>
<p><em>[Skinner Narrating] Sergeant Skinner took me under his wing... and showed me that life was won'th living.</p>
<p>I came to think ofhim as the big brother I never had.</p>
<p>He made me believe I might have a future after all.</em></p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p><em>And when they told us he was missing... presumed dead, my future died once again.</p>
<p>My life lost all meaning.</p>
<p>Come on! Get to the part where you steal his identity.</em></p>
<p>I'm trying to explain how emotionally fragile I was.</p>
<p>Oh, it's one of <em>those</em> stories.</p>
<p>[Clears Throat] Sergeant Skinner meant the world to me.</p>
<p><em>And l-I felt it was my duty to deliver the grim news to his mother.</em></p>
<p>[Clears Throat] Hello. I'm, uh- I'm-</p>
<p>Seymour, is that you?</p>
<p><em>[Skinner Narrating] I don't know why I did what I did.</p>
<p>I guess I couldn't bear to tell her about her son.</p>
<p>What I did was wrong, but... I'd do it again.</em></p>
<p>Yes, Mother, it's me.</p>
<p>You look different somehow.</p>
<p>But you must be Seymour. Yes. You are Seymour.</p>
<p><em>[Skinner Narrating] As strange as it sounds... deep down, I think she knew I wasrt her son... but the lie made us both happier than the truth ever could have.</em></p>
<p>You can have some lima beans as soon as you've cleaned your room.</p>
<p>Go! Upstairs, third door on the left.</p>
<p>Don't walk on the rugs!</p>
<p>Yes, Mother.</p>
<p><em>Don't judge her too harshly, Sergeant. She was a lonely old woman.</em></p>
<p>If you must blame someone, blame me.</p>
<p>That's pretty much what I was planning to do there, Armin.</p>
<p>Well, that's about it. And so, for the past 26 years...</p>
<p>I've dedicated myself to living out your dream.</p>
<p>I didn't dream anything about an aqua suit... or a lavender shirt, but you did take care of Mom.</p>
<p><em>A dagger! A dagger through my heart!</em></p>
<p>Here, Mother. Let me help you.</p>
<p>Get your hands off me!</p>
<p>Please, Mom.</p>
<p>You too, stranger!</p>
<p>I'm your son.</p>
<p>I have no son.</p>
<p>Look, lady, you obviously have at least one son.</p>
<p>No! I have one stranger and one fraud.</p>
<p>Take it easy, Mom.</p>
<p>I said, back off!</p>
<p>You better do as she says. She's quick with a hatpin.</p>
<p>Uh, well, hey, I suppose I'll have to find a hotel.</p>
<p>I won't hear of it. Tonight you can sleep on the floor of your office.</p>

<p>Hey, Armin.</p>
<p>[Muttering, Clears Throat]</p>
<p>Miss Krabappel sent me. I forged my dad's signature on my report card.</p>
<p>Oh, now, Bart, you know that's wrong.</p>
<p>I don't see how me signing Homer's name is any different... from you using Sergeant Skinner's name.</p>
<p>[Sighs] I guess me punishing you would be somewhat hypocritical.</p>
<p>Why don't you just write a 30-word essay on what you've done?</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey. Easy there, you big impostor.</p>
<p>[Beeping]</p>
<p>So, uh, um, should I sign my original name?</p>
<p>Just put an &quot;X,&quot; then call yourself whatever the hell you want.</p>
<p>Well, now, there's no need for profanity.</p>
<p>My name may have changed, but I'm still the same man I was last week.</p>
<p>Not to us you're not. I mean, how would you feel... if you suddenly found out Ned Flanders was an impostor?</p>
<p>Who's Ned Flanders?</p>
<p>My next-door neighbor. Religious guy?</p>
<p>Oh, you mean Reverend Lovejoy.</p>
<p>No, I don't!</p>
<p>What I mean is, to me you're just a stranger... pretending to be something he's not.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry, but that's just how I feel.</p>
<p>No, don't apologize. It's time I stopped pretending.</p>
<p>I've called this assembly to announce my retirement... effective as of the end of this sentence.</p>
<p>This sentence I'm speaking... right now.</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>[Gasping, Murmuring]</p>
<p>I wrongfully usurped Sergeant Skinner's position... and I suggest you consider him to replace me.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Well, now, I don't know.</p>
<p>Skinner, do you know anything about being a principal?</p>
<p>Well, it's been my lifelong ambition.</p>
<p>And if a man pretending to be me could do it... well, then, logically, the real me must be far more qualified.</p>
<p>Good enough.</p>
<p>Armin Tamzariars reign of terror is over.</p>
<p>Now let us welcome our new Principal Skinner, Principal Seymour Skinner.</p>
<p>Uh, him.</p>
<p>[Cheering]</p>
<p>Well, before I go, I've got some personal items for you.</p>
<p>You belong to the Radio Shack Battery Club.</p>
<p>Oh, 10 Canadian dollars. That's a souvenir from your trip to Upstate New York.</p>
<p>[Chuckles] You've led quite a life, Tamzarian.</p>
<p>It's your life. I just kept it warm for you.</p>
<p>Oh, I nearly forgot. Your pocket watch.</p>
<p>Mother's picture is still inside. Take good care of her.</p>
<p>I'll wind her every day.</p>
<p>I poached some fish for your trip, Mr. Tamzarian.</p>
<p>They're full of tiny bones, so I want you to be careful.</p>
<p>I will, Moth- uh, Mrs. Skinner. [Sighs]</p>
<p>Well, I'd better be going.</p>
<p>[Sighs]</p>
<p><em>[Knocking]</em></p>
<p>Good evening, Edna. I know we were planning to see a film tonight... but instead, I'm leaving town forever.</p>
<p>No, please. I don't care what you've done.</p>
<p>You're still a decent, honorable man.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>That's the kind of talk that makes me want to marry you.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>But instead, I'm leaving town forever.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Well, it's time to pick up where I left off- as a no-good street punk.</p>
<p><em>[Engine Starts]</em></p>
<p>Principal Skinner?</p>
<p>Up yours, children.</p>
<p>[Laughs] Now, to recap our top story in its entirety.</p>
<p>&quot;The adaptable citizens of Springfield have opened their hearts... to Principal Seymour Skinner, who&quot;-</p>
<p>Not that one. Idiots.</p>
<p>[Cheering]</p>
<p>Thank you. Thank you. I must say, in many ways...</p>
<p>Springfield really b*at the old slave-labor camp.</p>
<p>[Cheering]</p>
<p>I admit Sergeant Skinner seems okay.</p>
<p>But Mr. Tamzarian pulled himself up from the streets... and earned our respect and admiration.</p>
<p>He lied about his name.</p>
<p>His name doesn't matter.</p>
<p>&quot;A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.&quot;</p>
<p>Not if you called 'em stench blossoms.</p>
<p>Or crap weeds.</p>
<p>I'd sure hate to get a dozen crap weeds for Valentine's Day.</p>
<p>I'd rather have candy.</p>
<p>Not if they were called scum drops.</p>
<p>Your new principal would like to say a few words.</p>
<p>Remember, you have to respect him.</p>
<p>He's a w*r hero.</p>
<p>Ha-ha!</p>
<p>Thank you, Chalmers.</p>
<p>Where I come from, there's no better way to get acquainted... than by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance together.</p>
<p>Why don't you lead us, son?</p>
<p>Hey, America- [Spoken Lyrics] America.</p>
<p>[Flatulent Sound]</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p>Well, that's very concise... but it's an insult to everything I suffered for.</p>
<p>Now, take a seat, junior, and listen to someone... who gave their youth in service of their country.</p>
<p>Mrs. Krabappel, the pledge, please.</p>
<p>You haven't dealt with women for a long time, have you, Sergeant?</p>
<p>Are you asking me out?</p>
<p>[Siren Wailing]</p>
<p>Ah, 433rd Street.</p>
<p>My old neighborhood. Hmm.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes. Oh, yes.</p>
<p>Capitol City's nakedest ladies.</p>
<p>They're not even wearing a smile.</p>
<p>Nod suggestively. Yes, six. Count 'em.</p>

<p>A bar, Mom.</p>
<p>I don't know what that is... but on Fridays, you come straight home after school!</p>
<p>Tonight is silhouette night. Sit there.</p>
<p>I really just came home to change into a turtleneck.</p>
<p>Seymour, sit!</p>
<p>In the morning. Oh, Mom, I'm borrowing your car.</p>
<p>Good morning, Agnes.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Mmm, how's your new son working out?</p>
<p>That child is the most disobedient, smart-alecky, middle-aged man in creation!</p>
<p>Hello, ladies. Is this the line for people who wanna bad-mouth Sergeant Skinner?</p>
<p>And have 10 items or less.</p>
<p>Twelve, 11, 10. The mars a weenie.</p>
<p>Oh, now, be fair, Edna. I liked Armin Tamzarian too... but he was at least as big a weenie as Sergeant Skinner.</p>
<p>But he was our weenie.</p>
<p>Now, there was a weenie... you could be proud to call your son.</p>
<p>Did you ever tell him that?</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Okay, once more, where are we going?</p>
<p>To Capitol City.</p>
<p>And why are you and the old lady in the car?</p>
<p>We're gonna talk Armin Tamzarian into coming back.</p>
<p>And why is Marge here?</p>
<p>I came up with the idea.</p>
<p>And why am I here?</p>
<p>Because the streets of Capitol City... are no place for three unescorted ladies.</p>
<p>And why are the kids here?</p>
<p>Because we couldn't find Grampa to sit for them.</p>
<p>And why is Grampa here?</p>
<p>'Cause Jasper didn't wanna come by himself.</p>
<p>[Chuckles] Fair enough.</p>
<p>Hello, beautiful!</p>
<p>In your dreams.</p>
<p>We'll see about that.</p>
<p>[Snoring]</p>
<p>Hello, beautiful. [Snoring Resumes]</p>
<p>My mind is made up. I'm not coming back, and that's final.</p>
<p>Oh, Seymour.</p>
<p>And I'm not Seymour.</p>
<p>My name is Armin. This is Armirs apartment...</p>
<p>Armirs liquor, Armirs copy of <em>Swank,</em> Armirs frozen peas.</p>
<p>Can I see your copy of <em>Swank,</em> Armin?</p>
<p>Yes, you can.</p>
<p>This is Armirs life. Maybe it's not perfect, but at least I'm back where I belong.</p>
<p>I was born a no-goodnik, and I'll die a no-goodnik.</p>
<p>Seymour! I didn't bring you up to use language like that!</p>
<p>You didn't bring me up at all.</p>
<p>The hell I didn't!</p>
<p>I've been taking care of you for 26 years!</p>
<p>I'm the only mother you've ever known!</p>
<p>But you have your real son.</p>
<p>You're my real son!</p>
<p>You've been my son longer than he has.</p>
<p>He doesn't need me, and I don't need him!</p>
<p>You march yourself downstairs and get in that car!</p>
<p>Yes, Mother.</p>
<p>And the rest of you too!</p>
<p>[All] Yes, Mrs. Skinner.</p>
<p>[Honking Horn]</p>
<p>Hey, everybody, look! Armin Tamzariars back!</p>
<p>And he's gonna take over the school again!</p>
<p>[Chattering]</p>
<p>Now, hold on.</p>
<p>Armin Tamzarian is an unsavory character who played us all for chumps.</p>
<p>All right, all right. So he's a fraud.</p>
<p>I don't care. His mom doesn't care. Do any of you care?</p>
<p>Nope, not me.</p>
<p>I guess not.</p>
<p>You all seem to be forgetting that I am Seymour Skinner.</p>
<p>This is where I belong.</p>
<p>You can't ask me to disappear because you like some other guy better.</p>
<p><em>I gave half my life for you people.</em></p>
<p>Arert I entitled to a little dignity?</p>
<p>You're, uh- You're right, Sergeant.</p>
<p>Well, I don't see any way out of this.</p>
<p>Now, if you'll allow me, I think I have a solution... that'll satisfy the town and let Sergeant Skinner keep his dignity.</p>
<p><em>[Train Horn Blowing]</em></p>
<p>But I'm a hero!</p>
<p>And we salute you for it. Now, don't come back.</p>
<p>[Cheering]</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Seymour.</p>
<p><em>♪[Marching Band]</em></p>
<p>It's nice you're alive, but you're just not what I'm looking for in a son.</p>
<p>I'm glad you understand.</p>
<p>[Cheering Continues]</p>
<p><em>♪[Continues]</em></p>
<p>Well, this is a lovely gesture, but... we still have to face the fact that I'm not really Seymour Skinner.</p>
<p>Oh, no, we don't. Judge Snyder.</p>
<p>By authority of the city of Springfield...</p>
<p>I hereby confer upon you the name of Seymour Skinner... as well as his past, present, future and mother.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I further decree... that everything will be just like it was... before all this happened.</p>
<p>And no one will ever mention it again... under penalty of torture.</p>
<p>[Cheering]</p>
<p>Here, Son. This is yours again.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>I've never been happier or prouder to be Seymour Skinner... but these last few days as that hotheaded rogue Armin Tamzarian... have taught me a thing or two.</p>
<p>You know, maybe I've been a little too uptight in the past.</p>
<p>Well, from now on, you're gonna see a new Seymour Skinner.</p>
<p>Oh, no, we won't!</p>
<p>Yes, Mother.</p>
<p>[Murmuring]</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
