							<p>Dad, are you sure you're okay to drive at night?</p>
<p>It's night?!</p>
<p>All right, that's it. Pull over.</p>
<p>Now don't you worry.</p>
<p>Just sit back and relax to the smooth sounds of Tommy.</p>
<p>Dorsey's All-White Orchestra.</p>
<p>Son, let this music take you to a time when girls were girls and a Hershey bar was as thick as a phone book.</p>
<p>I'm sick of this song! ♪ Catch a falling star and... ♪</p>
<p>I don't like this one either... too optimistic!</p>
<p>Too slow!</p>
<p>Too fast!</p>
<p>No zazz!</p>
<p>Too much zazz!</p>
<p>More boogie!</p>
<p>Less woogie!</p>
<p>My back hurts! All my friends are dead!</p>
<p>Nice one.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Oh, no, we're gonna die.</p>
<p>Oh, no, we're gonna die.</p>
<p>Oh, no...</p>
<p>Son, call me an ambulance.</p>
<p>And while I'm in the hospital, you'll have to visit me every day.</p>
<p>And then I'll have to come live with you while I recover.</p>
<p>Eventually I'll die in your home, which'll hurt the resale value, but it'll all be...</p>
<p>Dad?</p>
<p>Dad? Wake up!</p>
<p>Who's... what, who?</p>
<p>Oh, I was having the most wonderful dream.</p>
<p>I always wake up just before the good part.</p>
<p>You can just drop me off here.</p>
<p>I'll see you later, honey.</p>
<p>Er, uh, yes?</p>
<p>I'm delivering your Scout Gal Cookies, Mayor Quimby!</p>
<p>That'll be $30.</p>
<p>For three boxes?</p>
<p>The money helps us serve the community.</p>
<p>We plant trees, pick up litter, cut up milk bones for old dogs...</p>
<p>It was rhetorical question.</p>
<p>And I used rhetoric in my answer?</p>
<p>Let's just move on.</p>
<p>27 to the left and open.</p>
<p>Where's all the money?</p>
<p>Why, it's right...</p>
<p>We spent all our money on that new slogan for Springfield.</p>
<p>Um, what say you leave the cookies, and I pay you double next year?</p>
<p>Sir, I didn't get this &quot;skepticism&quot; merit badge falling for promises like that.</p>
<p>If you don't give me those cookies, I'll pass a law forcing your organization to accept gay scout leaders.</p>
<p>I would strongly support that measure.</p>
<p>Just give me those cookies!</p>
<p>You get it...</p>
<p>Let go.</p>
<p>This is a low point for my administration.</p>
<p>No. You give it.</p>
<p>People of Springfield, our city is broke.</p>
<p>Uh, when you say broke, do you mean really broke, or uh, &quot;O.J. Simpson broke&quot;?</p>
<p>Really broke!</p>
<p>I've been reduced to using this cheap novelty gavel.</p>
<p>Order! Order!</p>
<p>Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>I know a lot of you from church and the market and such.</p>
<p>And I'm not much for talkin', but seems to me, in hard times like these that we Americans come together.</p>
<p>So I say we roll up our sleeves, and fake a disaster to trick the federal government out of relief money.</p>
<p>Rip off the federal government?</p>
<p>Mmm, I have reservations... for dinner in five minutes.</p>
<p>So all in favor, say &quot;aye&quot;!</p>
<p>Aye!</p>
<p>The &quot;ayes&quot; have it.</p>
<p>Now, when exactly did the hurricane pass through your town?</p>
<p>Er, uh, five minutes ago.</p>
<p>You just missed it.</p>
<p>FEMA will help you rebuild this town.</p>
<p>Your $10 million will arrive as soon as you submit this form, and the, uh, $2,500 processing fee.</p>
<p>And that's how a fake FEMA official scammed us out of $2,500. We are now worse than broke.</p>
<p>Panic not, fellow Springfielders!</p>
<p>I've gone through the town's financial records, and it turns out there are millions in uncollected city taxes.</p>
<p>We shall collect each and every back tax owed!</p>
<p>Everyone from...</p>
<p>Comic Book Guy to... Milhouse!</p>
<p>No one shall be spared!</p>
<p>Dozens of swindling b*at, as well as this respected reporter who made an honest mistake, have paid their back taxes, leaving only one outstanding debtor: country music star.</p>
<p>Lurleen Lumpkin, seen here at the height of her fame. ♪ Bunk with me tonight, Kermit ♪<br />
♪ Bunk with me tonight... ♪</p>
<p>Uh, really, Lurleen?</p>
<p>Hey, Dad, that's the singer you used to manage!</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>Dad was Colonel Homer and he wore that awesome suit and Lurleen wanted to bunk his brains out!</p>
<p>But I forget how Mom felt about it.</p>
<p>Kids, marriage is like a car.</p>
<p>Along the way it has its bumps and dings, and this country can't make one that lasts more than five years.</p>
<p>With Lurleen I just walked past the showroom and didn't even go inside.</p>
<p>Now let's return to watching the news.</p>
<p>Ms. Lumpkin owed $50,000 in back taxes.</p>
<p>With penalties, interest and the celebrity resentment tax, that sum has grown to $12 million.</p>
<p>However, she's been missing for several years, since her career went into a downward spiral.</p>
<p>I told her not to go into one of those.</p>
<p>The entire city is searching for her.</p>
<p>Not for any reward, but for the pleasure of destroying someone they once admired.</p>
<p>Save some for me!</p>
<p>Got her!</p>
<p>Krusty?</p>
<p>I just want to win one thing in my life!</p>
<p>It's not real.</p>
<p>Don't you dare ruin the moment!</p>
<p>Look at those idiots.</p>
<p>I bet Lurleen's a million miles away right now.</p>
<p>Hey, Homer.</p>
<p>Shh! I'm more wanted than the last petal on a bloomin' onion.</p>
<p>Don't worry. You can stay with us.</p>
<p>I'm sure Marge will be cool.</p>
<p>I'm taking you to your home, before you wreck mine!</p>
<p>You live here?</p>
<p>Bye, Marge.</p>
<p>Well, at least she's got a friend.</p>
<p>It's your turn to clean the toilet.</p>
<p>Where is it?</p>
<p>You're holding it.</p>
<p>Get in!</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>Thanks, Marge.</p>
<p>Gee, after all that's passed between us, I mean...</p>
<p>Well, you're a bigger woman than I am.</p>
<p>Are you calling me fat?</p>
<p>No, no, no!</p>
<p>I'll just be quiet.</p>
<p>Lurleen, this barbecue is delicious!</p>
<p>Oh, it's a traditional Southern recipe: ketchup, Coca-Cola, and fricasseed possum.</p>
<p>Just kiddin'. It's actually chicken.</p>
<p>Well, I think it's wonderful.</p>
<p>My diet starts tomorrow!</p>
<p>Listen, I'm sorry I called you all those mean things like... oh, I don't even remember.</p>
<p>Confederate degenerate?</p>
<p>Southern-fried succubus?</p>
<p>Hee-haw ho?</p>
<p>Oh, that's all right, Marge.</p>
<p>I'm just so grateful that y'all took me in and hid me from...</p>
<p>Freeze, Patsy Crime!</p>
<p>Chief, you okay?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Why'd you jump off the roof?</p>
<p>I just wanted to be extraordinary.</p>
<p>Your Honor, I would love to pay the money I owe, but country music changed, and I went out of style.</p>
<p>Objection! Speculating of trends in country music. of trends in country music.</p>
<p>I'm going to allow it.</p>
<p>Lurleen, the court orders you to make payments of a hundred dollars a week till such time as your music comes back in style or becomes appreciated for its camp value.</p>
<p>All right, what's the next case?</p>
<p>Judge, next we have a man who is suing his wife for not dressing sexy enough in &quot;The Case of the Horny Husband.&quot;</p>
<p>What the...?</p>
<p>Well, I thought if we acted like The People's Court, some day we'd beThe People's Court.</p>
<p>And, uh, well, a bailiff can dream, can't he?</p>
<p>No, he can't.</p>
<p>I don't get it, Lurleen. How did you lose all your money?</p>
<p>Did it go up your nose? Between your toes?</p>
<p>Sadly, no.</p>
<p>Most of my money went to my ex-husbands.</p>
<p>Boy, you sure have married a lot of super-hunks.</p>
<p>Well, from now on, the only thing I'm gonna be married to is my work.</p>
<p>I've already accepted &quot;a high-octane job in the nightlife industry.&quot;</p>
<p>All right, I need you to get the rats outta the jukebox, and clean the vomit out of the pool table pockets, and then you got the job.</p>
<p>Oh, and you've gotta share your tips with Manuel, who's, uh, actually me with a fake moustache.</p>
<p>Es good job.</p>
<p>You should take it.</p>
<p>Say, Lurleen, are you Jamaican?</p>
<p>'Cause &quot;Jamaican&quot; me crazy.</p>
<p>That's sweet, but I'm not lookin' to date.</p>
<p>No, I'm glad you said that.</p>
<p>'Cause you reminded me that I'm not looking a David.</p>
<p>So... so great.</p>
<p>Hey, Lurleen, I'm going down to the rock quarry tonight to throw stones at the woodchucks.</p>
<p>Want to come?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>That's okay. I understand.</p>
<p>Someone's lookin' at a snake in her mailbox.</p>
<p>She turned down Lenny and Carl?</p>
<p>That's like someone who doesn't like hamburgers or hot dogs.</p>
<p>What could make her hate men like that?</p>
<p>♪ I was cryin' in my cradle ♪<br />
♪ When my daddy hopped a train ♪<br />
♪ He left a hole in my heart and filled it up with pain ♪<br />
♪ I know no amount of liquor will soothe my achin' ticker ♪<br />
♪ 'Cause the love for my b*at daddy ♪<br />
♪ Is still pumpin' through my veins. ♪</p>
<p>So that's it.</p>
<p>She's been b*rned by the most important man in her life... her father.</p>
<p>How could a man just abandon his family?</p>
<p>By which I mean, what is the method he would use, and could anyone do it?</p>
<p>Where you going?</p>

<p>Lurleen Lumpkin has a hole in her heart, and I'm gonna fill it.</p>
<p>I've talked to over 500 men named Lumpkin.</p>
<p>Everyone at Lumpkin, Lumpkin and Rosenthal Associates, an Asian or Pacific lslander named Cho Lum Kin...</p>
<p>Good luck in searchings!</p>
<p>... but still no sign of Lurleen's dad!</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Are you Royce Lumpkin?</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>The father of Lurleen Lumpkin?</p>
<p>Lurleen?</p>
<p>I ain't seen my little girl in 30 years.</p>
<p>She must be what, uh, 12, 13 by now?</p>
<p>She's 34, and she's having a rough time!</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>I better whiskey up these corn flakes.</p>
<p>She needs to see you right away!</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>I better heroin up this orange juice.</p>
<p>There's only one man who can hambone like that.</p>
<p>Daddy!</p>
<p>Lurleen?! My goodness.</p>
<p>Why, you're the spittin' image of your mother's hotter sister!</p>
<p>Royce Lumpkin, where you been?</p>
<p>I've been a dang fool. That's where.</p>
<p>Can you forgive me, Lurleen?</p>
<p>The way that I immediately forgave myself?</p>
<p>I can, Daddy!</p>
<p>I made that hug happen!</p>
<p>Wait a minute. He's a b*at dad, and yet, he's getting as much love as me, a dad too lazy to run away!</p>
<p>And he has hair! Oh!</p>
<p>Bart, get me my su1c1de axe.</p>
<p>No su1c1de axe!</p>
<p>Later.</p>
<p>You know what I like best about this T-shirt?</p>
<p>I'll always be able to see your face.</p>
<p>Oh, well, you don't need a T-shirt for that, Tootsie Pop, 'cause I ain't ever gonna leave you again.</p>
<p>Just sit still in my lap!</p>
<p>What lap?</p>
<p>Yeah, all I see is a gut with knees!</p>
<p>Why you little...</p>
<p>Get back here so we can put our love on a shirt!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Lurleen's daddy comes back after 30 years, and he's father of the year. Why can't I leave for 30 years?</p>
<p>Fine with me. Look, I packed you a bag. it might be cold outside.</p>
<p>No problem. I bought you a hat.</p>
<p>Oh, I see. It's reverse psychology.</p>
<p>Well, in that case, I'm not going, and I'm not staying.</p>
<p>And I'll cut my steak with a spoon, then take a walk on the ceiling.</p>
<p>Oh, Daddy, you made me the happiest girl on whichever side of the Mississippi this is.</p>

<p>You'd think a house full of crazy people would be fun.</p>

<p>If you need me, I'll be...</p>
<p>Oh, who am I kidding?</p>
<p>No one needs me.</p>
<p>Colonel Homer!</p>
<p>And Major Marge!</p>
<p>Well, I don't...</p>
<p>Lurleen, you're giving your dad too much power over the way you feel about yourself.</p>
<p>Stop getting your self-esteem from the men in your life.</p>
<p>Well, that's easy for you to say.</p>
<p>You're married to a kind, thoughtful genius.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah...</p>
<p>Marge, my fringes are knotted again.</p>
<p>There's only one person in the world who can tell you what to do.</p>
<p>And that person is right here!</p>
<p>Santa Claus?!</p>
<p>No, no, that's just our old Christmas decorations.</p>
<p>Me?!</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>It's time for you to take control of your own destiny.</p>
<p>You're not a doormat. You're a door prize!</p>
<p>You're right, Marge.</p>
<p>And remember, you can do anything you want in the world of country music, Western wear merchandising and TV movies.</p>
<p>Regular movies... don't hold your breath.</p>
<p>But TV movies... the sky's the limit.</p>
<p>Colonel, you're still my knight in white polyester.</p>
<p>Ten percent Lycra.</p>
<p>Oh, I noticed.</p>
<p>Congratulations! That song I wrote you was so patriotic, they decided to make it into a Chevy commercial, so I, uh, changed a few lines.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>You're asking us to sell out our song. And for what?</p>
<p>Cash money.</p>
<p>Money? Ooh, we love money!</p>
<p>Really? That's great!</p>
<p>I'm gonna buy me a clock radio! you are a thief!</p>
<p>A dirty, rotten, lowdown...</p>
<p>I think I can say it better with this.</p>
<p>No, no, no, don't hit him in the head!</p>
<p>He needs that to think up our songs.</p>
<p>I'm Lurleen Lumpkin, and he stole your song from me!</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>Okay, maybe I abandoned my daughter and stole her song, but I'm still the most honorable record producer y'all have ever met.</p>
<p>Well, he's got us there.</p>
<p>Still, in human terms, he's deplorable.</p>
<p>Let's make guitar picks out of him!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>I'm droppin' y'all as clients!</p>
<p>Oh, I can't thank you guys enough.</p>
<p>Now I'm opening for the Dixie Chicks, and I may have just met husband 4.</p>
<p>Babe, need a hundred bucks for beer.</p>
<p>Ooh, I think he's a keeper.</p>
<p>Well, you're very welcome, Lurleen. Of all the women who've hit on Homer over the years, you're my favorite.</p>
<p>If you ever come near Homer again, I'll strangle you with your own hair extensions.</p>
<p>That's right. I know.</p>
