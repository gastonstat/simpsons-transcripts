<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>(SCREAMS)</p>
<p>(BRAKES SCREECHING)</p>
<p>All right, family.</p>
<p>Who can guess what's different about dinner tonight?</p>
<p>(EXCLAIMS INDIFFERENTLY) Same old garbage.</p>
<p>(ALL LAUGHING)</p>
<p>This guy's always on!</p>
<p>Oh, you two.</p>
<p>We're eating genetically modified vegetables.</p>
<p>Look how big they are!</p>
<p>This corn doesn't look so big.</p>
<p>That's baby corn.</p>
<p>(EXCLAIMS IN DISBELIEF) What?</p>
<p>American corporations should stop playing God with nature.</p>
<p>There's nothing to be afraid of.</p>
<p>They're all grown by the vegetable division of Union Carbide.</p>
<p>Mom, my potato is eating a carrot!</p>
<p>That's it. From now on, I'm growing all our vegetables myself.</p>
<p>(CAWING)</p>
<p>Go away! Go away!</p>
<p>What you doing, Mom?</p>
<p>I've tried heckling them. I've tried jeckling them.</p>
<p>It's time I made myself a scarecrow.</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>Go away! Go away!</p>
<p>&quot;...in God, the Father Almighty Creator of heaven and earth...&quot;</p>
<p>Shoo! Shoo!</p>
<p>(SCREAMING)</p>
<p>&quot;Heaven and earth...&quot; Where were we? Now I'm lost.</p>
<p>(CAWING)</p>
<p>Yeah, I did it! Marge is in the house!</p>
<p>I will be soon. Because it needs some cleaning!</p>
<p>(WHISTLING)</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>(SHRIEKS)</p>
<p>I'll regroup at Red Lobster.</p>
<p>(SHOUTING)</p>
<p>You ain't pretty no more!</p>
<p>(CAWING)</p>
<p>Look. I've made some friends. Now, go do my bidding!</p>
<p>Uh... Whatever it may be.</p>
<p>(CAWING)</p>
<p>So, Lisa says by k*ll their enemy I became the alpha crow.</p>
<p>I got to admit. I'm kind of nervous here.</p>
<p>We haven't seen Barney since they enveloped him.</p>
<p>I'm sure he'll turn up. Look, here's one of his buttons.</p>
<p>All right, that's it. Get them out of here! This ain't no crow bar!</p>
<p>This is a crow bar! See? They got the little stools and everything.</p>
<p>That's Russell Crow, Cameron Crow, Crow Diddley, Hume Crow-nyn, Gregory Peck.</p>
<p>Homer, I'm very uncomfortable having a gang of crows in our bedroom.</p>
<p>It's a m*rder, honey. A group of crows is called a m*rder.</p>
<p>I'm sleeping on the couch.</p>
<p>(CHOKING)</p>
<p>Drop it in! Don't cram it in! Forget it! I'll do it myself.</p>
<p>Aw, look. Maggie wants to fly, too.</p>
<p>Hey! Cut it out! Put her down!</p>
<p>(EXCLAIMS IN RELIEF) Thank God you're okay.</p>
<p>Okay, that was not cool. We need to lay down some ground rules.</p>
<p>We'll get to that! Right now, I think we need some time apart!</p>
<p>(CAWING ANGRILY)</p>
<p>All right, that's it! Shoo, you stupid crows!</p>
<p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p>
<p>(SCREAMING)</p>
<p>That is not a worm!</p>
<p>(SCREAMING)</p>
<p>Ow! Ow! I hate getting stitches in my eyes! Stupid crows!</p>
<p>Don't be mad at the crows, Homer.</p>
<p>They weren't trying to blind you.</p>
<p>They were just trying to drink your sweet, sweet eye juices.</p>
<p>Mmm. Fascinating. Say, Doctor, can you do something about my searing pain?</p>
<p>Well, there is a medication. Although, it's a little controversial.</p>
<p>Does it go in the butt?</p>
<p>I'm talking about medicinal marijuana.</p>
<p>Prescription pot. Texas THC.</p>
<p>Look, man, I don't do drugs!</p>
<p>Homer, for your eyes, the best tonic is chronic.</p>
<p>You're not afraid, are you?</p>
<p>I had a bad experience with drugs.</p>
<p>('60s ROCK PLAYING)</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: It was that golden weekend between summer school and regular school.</p>
<p>Hey, Homer, want to smoke some marijuana?</p>
<p>They say it's a gateway drug.</p>
<p>Well, well. If it isn't the Doobie Brothers.</p>
<p>Uh-oh. Crotch the weed, man.</p>
<p>Smell any drugs, Sergeant Scraps?</p>
<p>(SNIFFING)</p>
<p>(SNARLS)</p>
<p>(SCREAMS)</p>
<p>For me, the '60s ended that day in 1978.</p>
<p>But, Homer, you can't let a single bad experience scare you away from drugs.</p>
<p>But isn't marijuana, or &quot;dope,&quot; illegal?</p>
<p>Only for those who enjoy it.</p>
<p>Medical use of marijuana is legal in this state.</p>
<p>We'll also provide you with a prescription bong.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>Do you want the wizard or the skull?</p>
<p>(SINGING) Occasions, persuasions clutter your mind.</p>
<p>Incense and peppermints, the color of time.</p>
<p>Okay, let's see. &quot;Toke as needed.</p>
<p>&quot;Caution, objects may appear more edible than they actually are.&quot;</p>
<p>(INCENSE AND PEPPERMINTS PLAYING)</p>
<p>(SINGING) Incense, peppermints.</p>
<p>Incense, peppermints.</p>
<p>What's that billowing down the stairs?</p>
<p>(GASPS) It's smoke!</p>
<p>(SNIFFS) It smells like the art teacher's office.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: (SINGING) Smoke on the water.</p>
<p>Da-da-da-da-da-da-da!</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Da-da-da-da-da!</p>
<p>They b*rned down the gambling house.</p>
<p>It died with an awful sound.</p>
<p>I am hungry for a candy bar.</p>
<p>I think I'll eat a Mounds (GASPING)</p>
<p>Homer! You're doing drugs!</p>
<p>And now I'm guilty of possession! I could go to prison unless I testify against you.</p>
<p>Marge, it's making my eyes better. And it's legal.</p>
<p>I could walk up to the president and blow smoke in his stupid, monkey face!</p>
<p>And he'd just have to sit there grooving on it.</p>
<p>(SINGING) Color sky Havana lake.</p>
<p>Color sky rose carmethene.</p>
<p>Alizarian crimson.</p>
<p>Wear your love like heaven.</p>
<p>Wear your love like heaven.</p>
<p>Wear your love like heaven.</p>
<p>Wear your love like heaven.</p>
<p>Wear your love like heaven (TELEPHONE RINGING)</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Marge, I just realized.</p>
<p>I am the &quot;ow&quot; in the word &quot;now.&quot;</p>
<p>And if you tell anyone...</p>
<p>Honey, I like it when you call.</p>
<p>But we just talked five minutes ago.</p>
<p>(BEEPING ON THE LINE)</p>
<p>Hang on, I've got call waiting. Hello?</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Hey, it's me. I've got Marge on the other line and she is totally bumming me out.</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>(PLAYING BLUES)</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>Dad, I thought you didn't like her saxophone.</p>
<p>I didn't. But now, Daddy's special medicine, which you must never use because it will ruin your life, lets Daddy see and hear magical things you will never experience.</p>
<p>Ever!</p>
<p>Dad, it's 1:00 a.m. and I'm out of saliva!</p>
<p>(SHUSHING)</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>(PLAYING)</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Wow. That saxophone would make a great pipe.</p>
<p>(DOORBELL CHIMING)</p>
<p>Hi-diddily-hey, Homer!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>This dude does the best Flanders!</p>
<p>You got the mustache and the &quot;diddily!&quot;</p>
<p>Okay, now do Wiggum!</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>Homer, it's me. Ned.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES) Right. The God dude.</p>
<p>Hey, I got a question for you.</p>
<p>&quot;Could Jesus microwave a burrito so hot that he himself could not eat it?&quot;</p>
<p>(SIGHS)</p>
<p>Well, sir, of course he could. But then again, wow, as melon-scratchers go, that's a honey-doodle.</p>
<p>Now you know what I've been going through.</p>
<p>Well, luckily, I've got a book right here that's jam-packed with answers.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Oh, man, this is long. Could you read it to me?</p>
<p>(GASPS IN DELIGHT)</p>
<p>I guess that could be arranged.</p>
<p>&quot;The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God's people. The end.&quot;</p>
<p>Wow. Wow.</p>
<p>God does so much for me and he doesn't ask anything in return.</p>
<p>Well, I know he's wishing you'd sign his petition to re-criminalize medicinal marijuana.</p>
<p>Done and done! Now do Wiggum!</p>
<p>Well, okay. I guess it would go something like this.</p>
<p>(IMITATING WIGGUM) All right, Simpson, you're under arrest, see?</p>
<p>I said Wiggum!</p>
<p>&quot;And so, potential investors, I hope you don't think our IPO is an IPU.&quot;</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>Then I hold my nose thusly. What do you think, Smithers?</p>
<p>Bit of a downer, sir.</p>
<p>Well, I hope the investors like it.</p>
<p>I have to raise $60 million or we're out of business!</p>
<p>Why is that, sir?</p>
<p>I told you, I pissed it away!</p>
<p>Don't make that face.</p>
<p>Yes, that's the one.</p>
<p>Smithers, I need someone who laughs at all my jokes.</p>
<p>You know, honest feedback.</p>
<p>Oops! I thought this was the can, man.</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Well, you're a happy Homer. What's your name, young man?</p>
<p>You just said it!</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Well, if you like that, listen to this.</p>
<p>Working hard or hardly working?</p>
<p>(GUFFAWING)</p>
<p>Smithers, you could learn a thing or two from this braying moron.</p>
<p>Young man, I'm making you my executive vice president.</p>
<p>Sir, I believe that position was informally promised to me.</p>
<p>No, Smithers. I would've said anything to get your stem cells.</p>
<p>Now, welcome aboard!</p>
<p>You're covered with a very fine fuzz.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING) &quot;Hardly working.&quot;</p>
<p>Where did you get that suit?</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa! One question at a time! Yes, you?</p>
<p>Look, I'm really starting to worry.</p>
<p>There's half-eaten cupcakes everywhere. We're all out of paper clips.</p>
<p>And the curtains smell like doob.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? Well, I got news for you!</p>
<p>I just got promoted, and it's all thanks to &quot;Yes-I-cannabis!&quot;</p>
<p>(SCOFFS)</p>
<p>We have a kitchen?</p>

<p>(MUSIC PLAYING ON TV)</p>
<p>(Woman on tv) Now, where are those three chandelier-hangers I hired?</p>
<p>(GLASS SHATTERING)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: You mutton heads! This is why we can never hold down a job.</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Look at Shemp. He is so high!</p>
<p>Hey, &quot;Shemp&quot; is &quot;hemp&quot; spelled backwards.</p>
<p>And &quot;Otto&quot; is &quot;Otto&quot; backwards!</p>
<p>Now, I'm scared.</p>
<p>Homie, I don't mean to nag, but what does this have to do with healing your eyes?</p>
<p>As soon as I graduate, I am so out of here!</p>
<p>(Kent on news) This just in. The Marijuana Re-Criminalization lnitiative took another step forward today as supporters collected the final signatures required to place it on the ballot for next Tuesday's election.</p>
<p>We got to get out and stop that initiative!</p>
<p>Marge, I'm gonna need 10,000 veggie burritos!</p>
<p>No guac in mine.</p>
<p>Good night, Homer.</p>
<p>Dude, your mom is hot.</p>
<p>Don't encroach on our roach! Don't encroach on our roach!</p>
<p>(SINGING) You've got to run like an antelope out of control (MUSIC STOPS)</p>
<p>(PEOPLE MURMURING)</p>
<p>Okay, okay. Hold on. Hold on.</p>
<p>(SNIFFS) I smell marijuana smoke.</p>
<p>That better be medicinal!</p>
<p>If Phish don't see a prescription slip, we are out of here!</p>
<p>We can wait all night, people.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>(MUMBLES GRAVELY)</p>
<p>Whoa! This guy is seriously ill.</p>
<p>My doctor never told me that. I had to hear it from Phish.</p>
<p>(SINGING) A one, a-two, a you-know-what-to-do.</p>
<p>Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.</p>
<p>You've got to run like an antelope out of control.</p>
<p>Thank you. And now, a man who's a real pothead.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. &quot;Pothead.&quot;</p>
<p>Homer Simpson!</p>
<p>(PEOPLE CHEERING)</p>
<p>Good afternoon. I want to thank you all for coming down here, taking time off from your jobs.</p>
<p>Jobs? What? Jobs...</p>
<p>Because we need to keep medical marijuana legal!</p>
<p>(ALL CHEERING)</p>
<p>Whether you suffer from glaucoma or you just rented The Matrix, medical marijuana can make things fabulous, medically.</p>
<p>(CHEERING)</p>
<p>So, my mellow fellow citizens, when you go into that voting booth on Tuesday, the seventh...</p>
<p>(PEOPLE MURMURING)</p>
<p>Uh, Homer, that was yesterday.</p>
<p>Oh, man! They already voted! And we lost!</p>
<p>(DISAPPOINTED SIGHS)</p>
<p>Oh, man! I can't believe we spaced on the date!</p>
<p>What are we gonna do?</p>
<p>Well, we can't just stand here staring at our hands, although... Wow!</p>
<p>That's right! I married that chick.</p>
<p>They call them fingers, but I never see them fing.</p>
<p>Oh, there they go.</p>
<p>There we go. Dump all that medical marijuana on there.</p>
<p>(ALL SNIFFING)</p>
<p>(ALL EXCLAIMING)</p>
<p>Actually, that smoke is a little too inviting.</p>
<p>Throw on that sack of barber hair.</p>
<p>(ALL COUGHING)</p>
<p>I could've smoked that pot and worn that hair.</p>
<p>Homie, you don't need drugs anymore.</p>
<p>Your eyes are all better.</p>
<p>Eyes? What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p>I want my old dad back. The one who was yelling all the time and...</p>
<p>You know, I'm not really sure what I want.</p>
<p>Homer, it's over. I want you to look at your children and promise them you will never do drugs again.</p>
<p>All right, I'll do it for my kids.</p>
<p>As long as you're doing things for me, would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house?</p>
<p>Never!</p>
<p>Yeah, I can still crash here, right?</p>
<p>Get out.</p>
<p>Remember when I dropped my keys and you thought the phone was ringing?</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING) Yeah.</p>
<p>Get out.</p>
<p>(SIGHS DESPONDENTLY)</p>
<p>What's the matter, Homer? You're drunk.</p>
<p>But you're not like sloppy drunk.</p>
<p>Going cold turkey isn't as delicious as it sounds.</p>
<p>Look, I'm really glad you're off the wacky-tobacky.</p>
<p>Yeah. You were getting all spacey and everything.</p>
<p>We were gonna have an intervention.</p>
<p>Yeah. But at the planning party, I got alcohol poisoning.</p>
<p>I nearly died.</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>I was already making excuses not to go to your funeral.</p>
<p>It's been three days, and my mind is clearer.</p>
<p>My sperm count is up, and I'm able to recognize simple shapes and patterns.</p>
<p>Dad, you just said that three minutes ago.</p>
<p>Unregardless, I will no longer be a slave to this!</p>
<p>Why are you keeping that thing?</p>
<p>As a reminder, Marge.</p>
<p>(RINGING)</p>
<p>Yello.</p>
<p>Ahoy-hoy, Executive V. P.</p>
<p>I'm putting the final touches on my speech to the investors.</p>
<p>And I need your generous guffaws.</p>
<p>But I can't find you funny anymore.</p>
<p>I'll either tickle your ribs or feed them to my dogs!</p>
<p>Now, we're ordering out. What would you like on your pizza pie?</p>
<p>Extra cheese?</p>
<p>What do you take me for? Lorenzo de' Medici? See you soon.</p>
<p>Don't worry, Homie.</p>
<p>You don't need Mary Jane to laugh at Mr. Burns' jokes.</p>
<p>Just picture him naked.</p>
<p>(SHRIEKS)</p>
<p>Or... With a funny hat on!</p>
<p>(SCREAMING)</p>
<p>&quot;So, profit margins will be thinner (CHUCKLING) than Louise Brooks' negligee.&quot;</p>
<p>You know, Louise Brooks, the silent star of Lulu.</p>
<p>(WHISPERING) One of us has got to start laughing.</p>
<p>If Mr. Burns gets flop sweat, he'll die of dehydration.</p>
<p>I'm drenched with sweat.</p>
<p>I'm going to take a bathiola.</p>
<p>When I come back, you'd better be laughing.</p>
<p>This stuff can make anything funny, even that show that follows Friends.</p>
<p>But I promised my family I wouldn't smoke it anymore.</p>
<p>Well, I've got to do something.</p>
<p>Start inhaling, Waylon.</p>
<p>This suit used to belong to Judy Garland.</p>
<p>We could sing a song if you don't mind being Mickey Rooney.</p>
<p>You mean that guy on 60 Minutes who yells all the time?</p>
<p>Sixty minutes? Oh, my God! Mr. Burns has been in the tub for an hour!</p>
<p>(SCREAMING)</p>
<p>Oh, Mr. Burns! You were too beautiful for this world.</p>
<p>Oh, man. Oh, man. We k*ll Mr. Burns!</p>
<p>Mr. Burns is gonna be so mad!</p>
<p>The investors meeting is in 20 minutes!</p>
<p>So what? Mr. Burns is dead!</p>
<p>We can carry on. Michael Eisner's been dead for five years.</p>
<p>Ted Turner's just a hologram. Now, we got to think.</p>
<p>So, when somebody says I was an embarrassment to the country, I say, &quot;It depends on what the meaning of 'was' is, jerk!&quot;</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING)</p>
<p>You owe me $200,000. Good night, everybody!</p>
<p>Bill Clinton, everyone! He's Jimmy Carter with a Fox attitude!</p>
<p>And now, a man you will see is definitely not dead, Mr. Montgomery Burns!</p>
<p>(AUDIENCE CLAPPING)</p>
<p>Mr. Burns, as we're running long, may we skip your speech and go directly to the questions?</p>
<p>Mr. Burns, a two-part question.</p>
<p>One, when will you see a profit again?</p>
<p>And two, what's that red stuff coming out of your ear?</p>
<p>Mr. Burns, may I field that one?</p>
<p>It's true we're losing money.</p>
<p>But there's no reason we can't dance, dance, dance the night away!</p>
<p>(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)</p>
<p>(AUDIENCE GASPING)</p>
<p>Mr. Burns has left the building!</p>
<p>(All) We are mollified!</p>
<p>We are mollified!</p>
<p>Brilliant. We lost $60 million and they're cheering for more.</p>
<p>(GASPS) Mr. Burns, you're alive!</p>
<p>Yes. I regained consciousness during my big dance number.</p>
<p>Those strings pulling me every which way jostled my heart from its slumber.</p>
<p>And you wanted to take him to the hospital!</p>
<p>Oh, and you didn't? Well, the worm has finally shown its fangs!</p>
<p>Smithers, make me slap him!</p>
<p>You call that a slap? Make me slap you.</p>
<p>Now, both.</p>
<p>Now, just you.</p>
<p>Now, give me a taste.</p>
<p>Now, both again.</p>
<p>(Mr. Burns) Now, all three.</p>
<p>(SLAPPING SOUNDS)</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
