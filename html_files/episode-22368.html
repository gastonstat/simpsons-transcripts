Ned 'n' Edna's Blend<br />
Original Air Date on May 7, 2012</p>
<p>(yells)</p>
<p><strong>Director</strong>: <em>Okay, people, we are trying</em> to depict the sizzling final days of the Nathan Lane of the New Testament, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Now remember, this is the Passion Play, not The Phone it In Play. not the I Once Had Three Shows on Broadway Simultaneously But I Blew All My Money on Coke and Now Here I Am Play, so let's do this thing!</p>
<p>Hi. My name is Milhouse Van Houten, and I am auditioning for the role of Child Who Points.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, point stage left.</p>
<p>I prepared right!</p>
<p>Well, I better get going.</p>
<p>This is starting to feel a little churchy.</p>
<p>Why do we have to audition for the stupid play, and Dad gets to leave?</p>
<p>I already have my part.</p>
<p>Man Who Buys Ticket, But Doesn't Show Up.</p>
<p>Also, the Passion Play isn't stupid.</p>
<p>It's the greatest story ever told.</p>
<p>Maybe it was once, but now there's lots of better stories.</p>
<p>h*tler mashups!</p>
<p>And Lenny's story about Cancun.</p>
<p>Yeah, why aren't we doing Lenny's story?</p>
<p>That thing's hilarious.</p>
<p>Not so hilarious for me.</p>
<p>I nearly lost a toe.</p>
<p>That's what you get for having a monkey give you a foot massage.</p>
<p>My bucket list is my business.</p>
<p>Next audition!</p>
<p>Ah-ha-ha. Name's Ned Flanders.</p>
<p>Credits include Jesus in the Passion Play last year, Jesus in the Passion Play the year before that, Jesus, Jesus, a kindly hobo who turns out to be-- you guessed it-- Saint Peter...</p>
<p>Enough! Enough, already.</p>
<p>I'm so bored I'm ready to introduce myself to my two assistants here.</p>
<p>You will be a non-speaking Pharisee.</p>
<p>But-but-but...</p>
<p>Jesus didn't stammer!</p>
<p>His voice hit the back of the theater!</p>
<p>He was a god who turned water into wine and did not wear shoes.</p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p>He said simple things that many followed.</p>
<p>Just like me on Twitter!</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>And he was tragically k*ll while still in his 30s...</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>...after an all-night dinner.</p>
<p>Woo-hoo!</p>
<p>I'm your Jesus! Me!</p>
<p>Boom. Done.</p>
<p>This guy's perfect!</p>
<p>You understand why God would have forsaken him.</p>
<p>(chuckling)</p>
<p>Well, congratulations, Homer.</p>
<p>I guess this is just my cross to bear.</p>
<p>What's that a reference to?</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Ooh, nice and roomy.</p>
<p>Our Lord sure knew how to keep 'em cool.</p>
<p>Dad?</p>
<p>Yes, sweetie?</p>
<p>First of all, congratulations on getting the lead.</p>
<p>Whee! Whee!</p>
<p>I just hope you're going to take this seriously.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, Lisa.</p>
<p>Very seriously. Whee!</p>
<p>Dad, the story of the Passion is the cornerstone of the Christian faith.</p>
<p>And although I personally follow the enlightened teachings of Lord Buddha, messing with Jesus really gets people mad.</p>
<p>It's like wearing a Florida State jersey to a Florida game.</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>O Lord, why have you placed this fearsome burden on my shoulders?</p>
<p>(sobbing)</p>
<p>It'll be fine.</p>
<p>Just learn your lines.</p>
<p>Does Jesus have a big part in this thing?</p>
<p>He's in every scene.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>(sobbing loudly)</p>
<p>Why do I succeed at everything I audition for?</p>
<p>Dear Lord, I know you see all, but trust me, You do not want to see this.</p>
<p>And so our Lord was brought before Pontius Pilate.</p>
<p>What's he in for?</p>
<p>He calls himself &quot;King of the Jews.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>Okay, be straight with me.</p>
<p>You can probably plead this down to crucifixion.</p>
<p>Do you call yourself King of the Jews?</p>
<p>Thou sayest it.</p>
<p>(exclaiming)</p>
<p>He's good.</p>
<p>Wow, I'm so moved I renounce science, with the facts, and the peer reviews, and the hypotheses tested by evidence.</p>
<p>What shall I do then with Jesus, which is called Christ?</p>
<p>Crucify him!</p>
<p>They cannot judge me.</p>
<p>Only my father can judge me.</p>
<p>Crucify him!</p>
<p>I'll take you with me, old man!</p>
<p>Jesus was handed a heavy cross, and upon his brow was placed a crown...</p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p>...of thorns.</p>
<p>What the...?</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>(crying)</p>
<p>Daughters of Jerusalem!</p>
<p>Weep not for me, but weep for yourselves.</p>
<p>You know, Homer's giving it the old Bible-college try.</p>
<p>Maybe I should've dialed down the Doubting Thomas.</p>
<p>Silence, Pharisee!</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>Looks like someone didn't follow the underwear rule!</p>
<p>This man is totally the Son of God.</p>
<p>Tonight you shall be at my right hand in heaven.</p>
<p>All right!</p>
<p>It pays to network at these things.</p>
<p>Jesus cried again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.</p>
<p>(cries out in anguish)</p>
<p>(quietly): Lord, forgive me for my pride.</p>
<p>All wise as always, you have rightly raised Homer above me.</p>
<p>Never again will I question...</p>
<p>(yells)</p>
<p>Out of my way, stupid Flanders!</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>Ah, I knew we should've done <em>Spamalot.</em></p>
<p>I'm not licked.</p>
<p>I'll just make them think this was planned.</p>
<p>(imitates drum brushes)</p>
<p>♪ Who's to say ♪<br />
♪ This didn't happen ♪<br />
♪ Who's to say ♪<br />
♪ And curtain! ♪</p>
<p>Diddily... doodily...</p>
<p>No atheist bl*od, please.</p>
<p>Sorry, ma'am, only members of the immediate family allowed in.</p>
<p>It's okay.</p>
<p>She's my wife.</p>
<p>(gasping)</p>
<p>Ned and Edna, married?</p>
<p>That's right. Ha!</p>
<p><strong>Crowd</strong>: Wow!</p>
<p>Oh, my goodness.</p>
<p>Hey, Dad.</p>
<p>You remember when you said if Flanders got remarried you'd eat your hat?</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Ooh, licorice!</p>
<p>Mmm, historically inaccurate.</p>
<p>Well, it was nice having a secret marriage while it lasted.</p>
<p>Well, sir, now we'll have an open marriage!</p>
<p>Um... you do know what that means?</p>
<p>No, but I'm sure Newt Gingrich wouldn't steer us wrong.</p>
<p>At least in the hospital we can just enjoy a nice, quiet moment together.</p>
<p>(chuckling)</p>
<p>Congratulations, you two!</p>
<p>We're so, so happy for you.</p>
<p>Welcome to marriage.</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>Another good man bites the dust.</p>
<p>Homer!</p>
<p>I'm talking about this guy!</p>
<p>Oh, I sure envy him.</p>
<p>Homer!</p>
<p>I mean, I envy Flanders, once again enjoying the joys of marriage.</p>
<p>Let's put it to a vote, America.</p>
<p>Enough with the voting.</p>
<p>Ned, Edna, why didn't you tell us?</p>
<p>'Cause everyone in this town makes such a big heckabaloo out of everything.</p>
<p>Nedding bells are ringing.</p>
<p>See what happens when Teachy met Preachy on Channel 6, your source for news-based puns.</p>
<p>I was just down the hall getting some very bad news, and I saw there was a party going on.</p>
<p>Congratulations from the Mayor.</p>
<p>Vote Quimby.</p>
<p>Many happy returns!</p>
<p>Hope you're both happy.</p>
<p>Edna, as the runner-up in the race for your heart, I would like to make a toast.</p>
<p>My Dearest, let me be the first to offer you the hearty handshake that would've climaxed our own wedding day...</p>
<p>Seymour, did you use my wig glue to patch your shoes again?</p>
<p>I tied them together with used dental floss, as per your memo!</p>
<p>Everybody out. Now!</p>
<p>(grumbling)</p>
<p>Not you.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>O Lord, please bless our blended family.</p>
<p>And thank you for &quot;cigarette mommy.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, honey, please don't call me that.</p>
<p>Okay, &quot;do-over mommy.&quot;</p>
<p>Boys, you will please call your new mother whatever <em>she</em> feels comfortable with.</p>
<p>How about &quot;Edna?&quot;</p>
<p>It's disrespectful to call a grown-up by their first name.</p>
<p><strong>Bart</strong>: Yo, Homer, Mom says get your fat ass over to the Flanders'.</p>
<p>Bart! Don't call me that!</p>
<p>Which one?</p>
<p>&quot;Homer&quot; or &quot;fat ass&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Why, you little...</p>
<p>They're both bad, and I suspect you know it!</p>
<p><strong>Bart</strong>: Get your hands off of me, you fat ass!</p>
<p>(doorbell rings)</p>
<p>Ned, Edna.</p>
<p>We just want to apologize... (growling) ...for the commotion in your room.</p>
<p>People here do not respect boundaries.</p>
<p>Homer, did you just buckle your belt through my loop?</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Well, we're here to offer to throw you a little party in your honor.</p>
<p>A little party might be fun.</p>
<p>The only guests at our wedding were Ned's parents.</p>
<p>Look at those squares, makin' it nice and legal.</p>
<p>We didn't need a piece of paper!</p>
<p>We had a paper, Nedward.</p>
<p>We just rolled it and smoked it.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>We got high-diddily-high on that reeferino.</p>
<p>Less news from the pews.</p>
<p>Okay, Simpsons.</p>
<p>Well, call me a cock-eyed optimist 'cause I think some sort of celebration party might possibly be fun!</p>
<p>Great!</p>
<p>We'll take care of everything.</p>
<p>We'll just need to borrow your punch bowl, 17 chairs, your portable dance floor, your banner printer, banner ink, and a ream of blank banners.</p>
<p>Okay, there's no school; your dad's at work; and it's really coming down.</p>
<p>Anyone for Scrabble?</p>
<p>Only God can make words.</p>
<p>Right, right. Yahtzee?</p>
<p>Dice are Satan's bones.</p>

<p>What the hey, Mrs. K?</p>
<p>Thank God, a real kid.</p>
<p>You want my advice on dealing with the Hardly Boys?</p>
<p>Why do you care?</p>
<p>I don't. I'm just bored watching worms drown.</p>
<p>Okay, what do you got?</p>
<p>Well, what you got to do is get them into the real world.</p>
<p>Skipping is cool!</p>
<p>Especially when you're holding hands with your brother.</p>
<p>If you don't act now, when they grow up, people like me are gonna take all their money and girlfriends.</p>
<p>Oh, come on. They're not that hopeless.</p>
<p>I'm doing it!</p>
<p>I'm doing it!</p>
<p>(whimpers)</p>
<p>This is my third-favorite wedding supply store.</p>
<p>Whoo! Look at these.</p>
<p>&quot;Extreme weddings.</p>
<p>&quot;Triathlon...</p>
<p>&quot;Zero-G...</p>
<p>Tie the knot at the top of Mount Everest&quot;?</p>
<p>It's extreme enough for me when they smear the wedding cake on each other's faces.</p>
<p>So, Marge, the rumors are true.</p>
<p>Why did you get to throw a party for Ned and Edna and not me?</p>
<p>Well, you're all invited so you can make your snippy comments while you eat my hors d'oeuvres.</p>
<p>Snippy? How can you say that in those shoes?</p>
<p>(grunts)</p>
<p>They have ltchy and Scratchy weddings?</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>Ready to go home, Ned?</p>
<p>I'm sorry, honey, but I'm stuck in this meeting of the Springfield LGBT.</p>
<p>The left-gifted bidextrous and transhanded community.</p>
<p>We're trying to decide on the theme for our Left is Right parade.</p>
<p>&quot;Ourcissors, Ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>How about, &quot;Death to Righties&quot;?</p>
<p>We have to live among them.</p>
<p>To live among them is to die.</p>
<p>(all arguing)</p>
<p>Oh, this could go late.</p>
<p>We haven't even ordered pizzas and pop yet.</p>
<p>Could you handle Rod and Todd's parent-teacher conference for me?</p>
<p>Sure, I'd love to be the parent for once.</p>
<p>Now <em>I</em> can bring a latte and leave the cup on the desk. Ha!</p>
<p>(glass breaks)</p>
<p>Sorry. I'm still a pre-op transhander.</p>
<p><strong>Teacher</strong>: <em>Well, I must say at this school we've never seen a step-parent before.</em></p>
<p>Look, I'm a chalk jockey, too, so don't slap ketchup on bread and tell me it's Pizza Friday.</p>
<p>You teach with that mouth?</p>
<p>Yes. I teach at Springfield Elementary, and we believe that...</p>
<p>Public school?</p>
<p>Well, I'll be a monkey's unrelated creature.</p>
<p>Well, we'll fit you into our school prayers.</p>
<p>You do have science here, right?</p>
<p>We sure do.</p>
<p>Behold advanced astronomy.</p>
<p>You pulled the boys out of school?</p>
<p>Ned, I know I should have consulted you, but that school is beneath them.</p>
<p>Take my word as a teacher of 15 years.</p>
<p>Well, sir, when we got married, I knew I'd find some spices in my chili.</p>
<p>I guess they can go to Springfield Hellementary.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>(moaning)</p>
<p>Why are we here, Neddy?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I think talking dogs are the spawn of the devil.</p>
<p>Yeah, but...</p>
<p>Secondly, we're watching my little Toddy graduate from college.</p>
<p>Oh, now aren't you glad you let Edna take charge of the boys' education?</p>
<p>Yep, it's lucky she's not in my taxes 'cause I underestimated her.</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Liberal professors, feminist workshops, abstract sculptures.</p>
<p>This isn't a Midwestern Bible college.</p>
<p>This is an elite East Coast university.</p>
<p>It's okay, Daddy.</p>
<p>I majored in religious studies.</p>
<p>Whew!</p>
<p>Comparative religious studies.</p>
<p>(screams)</p>
<p>(tires screech)</p>
<p>Give me your keys!</p>
<p>Maybe I'll just park it myself.</p>
<p>Why are you parking yourself?</p>
<p>Why are you parking yourself?</p>
<p>We haven't taken in one car all day.</p>
<p>You really put on a great reception, Marge.</p>
<p>It's like the happy flashback in a gritty cop thriller.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Everyone's having a great time.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Helen, have a canapé.</p>
<p>There's enough for everyone.</p>
<p>But not too much. (chuckles)</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>(both giggling)</p>
<p>Yar...</p>
<p>No weird hookups!</p>
<p>Call me!</p>
<p>I'm married to the sea, and I'm seeing two of the Great Lakes on the side.</p>
<p>I won't say which ones, but it's eerie how superior they are.</p>
<p>So how do the boys like Springfield Elementary?</p>
<p>Marge, it's wonderful.</p>
<p>They're opening up, they've seen a wider world.</p>
<p>I wrote with a Flair pen.</p>
<p>(chuckles) Well, that's just great, boys.</p>
<p>Now come over here so Mrs. Simpson can take a photo.</p>
<p>Make sure our temporary tats are in the picture.</p>
<p>Mine's a sassy princess who speaks her mind.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Mine's a duck with no pants.</p>
<p>What if we were raptured right now?</p>
<p>Ned, I said it was okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, chillax, Daddy.</p>
<p>Chillax? Young man in the Flanders' house we speak the King's diddily.</p>
<p>Time for cake!</p>
<p>Let's finish this sucker up.</p>
<p>You get my boys tattoos, you change their school, you buy Rod sneakers that light up like Times Square.</p>
<p>Shoes are shoes and lights are lights.</p>
<p>Now just when do I get a say in how my boys are raised?!</p>
<p>This marriage isn't perfect!</p>
<p>(phones beeping)</p>
<p>No video! Party over!</p>
<p>Cake!</p>
<p>Too late, Marge.</p>
<p>Mm!</p>
<p>Ned, these boys trust me to be their mother.</p>
<p>You'd better decide whether you do.</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>And that's that.</p>
<p>Another story in the classic, infallible three-act structure.</p>
<p>Good enough for Aristotle, good enough for the Simpsons.</p>
<p>Mr. Syzslak, I have a feeling there's gonna be one more act to this story.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not hanging around for that.</p>
<p>Four acts...</p>
<p>Ned, how did you sleep?</p>
<p>Fine, I guess.</p>
<p>Thanks for loaning me your pajamas, Homer.</p>
<p>And Marge, thank you for those helpful chip bag clips.</p>
<p>(clacking)</p>
<p>I just felt so ashamed, I couldn't go home.</p>
<p>Yesterday I gave in to the one thing I vowed I would never have in my marriage: strong feeling.</p>
<p>Here's your lunches... with some cake.</p>
<p>You'll be having cake for a long, long time.</p>
<p>Bart, aren't you gonna tell Mom and Dad about the problem you have?</p>
<p>Shut up!</p>
<p>I'm just saying it won't get better unless you talk to an adult.</p>
<p>Maggie knows how to keep a secret.</p>
<p>Why can't you?</p>
<p>Bart, is there something you want to tell us?</p>
<p>Oh, Marge, let the kid have his embarrassing secrets and lies.</p>
<p>That is totally irresponsible parenting.</p>
<p>Not according to the lnternet.</p>
<p>Where on the lnternet?</p>
<p>I'm sure some idiot somewhere agrees with me.</p>
<p>Why would you believe him?</p>
<p>Because his avatar is Darth Maul, the second-coolest Darth.</p>
<p>And what he says is true because it's in all caps.</p>
<p>Are you gonna argue with caps?</p>
<p>Why does that make it right?</p>
<p>He took the time to press the shift key, Marge.</p>
<p>I think he knows what he's talking about.</p>
<p>So after all this time together you two still haven't agreed on how to raise your kids?</p>
<p>Ned, I realized long ago there are some things Homer and I will never completely agree on.</p>
<p>(chuckles) Yeah, but we make sure never to go to bed hungry.</p>
<p>It's &quot;angry.&quot;</p>
<p>Don't tell me what our thing is!</p>
<p>It's about not agreeing on something.</p>
<p>I've always said hungry!</p>
<p>Bart, just tell us the problem.</p>
<p>I'm keeping a dolphin in my bathtub!</p>
<p>I thought I heard clicks and pops!</p>
<p>(microphone feeds back)</p>
<p>Children, your test scores are down because we've been having so many assemblies, you haven't had time to study.</p>
<p>This assembly will remedy that.</p>
<p>We've invited a few friends over to give you some musical cues.</p>
<p>(piano plays bouncy intro)</p>
<p>I'm Sally Scantron Sheet.</p>
<p>And I'm Peter Pencil.</p>
<p>Now, you didn't hear it from us, but the answers to the test are...</p>
<p>(to the tune of &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;): ♪ A, B, D, D, C, A, B... ♪</p>
<p>Are you just giving them the answers?</p>
<p>They still have to sign their names properly, so we're not totally out of woods.</p>
<p>Pause the assembly!</p>
<p>I have to talk to my wife.</p>
<p>Ned?</p>
<p>My rival.</p>
<p>Some rivalry.</p>
<p>It's like Secretariat versus a can of dog food.</p>
<p>Edna, I'm sorry and I'll say it in front of God or groundskeeper Willie.</p>
<p>Oh, Ned, I'm sorry, too.</p>
<p>I overstepped your boundaries.</p>
<p>I guess I never really truly cared about children before.</p>
<p>(all gasp)</p>
<p>Oh, get over it.</p>
<p>And Ned, I'll be exactly as much mom as you want me to be.</p>
<p>Hey, the Simpsons make it up as they go along, and they're as happy as a ribbon in a Bible.</p>
<p>What do you say, sweetie?</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>Mmm...</p>
<p>Mmm...</p>
<p>(cheering)</p>
<p>Now in our 50th location in Springfield.</p>
<p>Sleazy Sam would like to welcome our special grand-opening star, Jesus.</p>
<p>Welcome, money changers.</p>
<p>You can trust Sleazy Sam for the best rates, or my name isn't Jesus H....</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>Are you gonna do that every time I open one of these?</p>
<p><strong>Singers</strong>: ♪ Hens love roosters, geese love ganders ♪<br />
♪ Everyone else loves Ned Flanders ♪</p>
<p>(record needle skips)</p>
<p><strong>Ned</strong>: ♪ My mustache is bristly, my letters are epistly ♪<br />
♪ And I don't want to mislead you ♪<br />
♪ I like to hug and kissly ♪</p>
<p><strong>Edna</strong>: Ha!</p>
<p>♪ First base, yo, I like Christian rap ♪<br />
♪ A Bible on my lap ♪</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: ♪ Will you stop this stupid crap? ♪<br />
♪ I want to take a nap. ♪</p>
<p><strong>Ned</strong>: Okely-dokely.</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
