							<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Would you turn off that rock 'n' rock music?</p>
<p>Don't have a stegosaurus, man.</p>
<p>These talking dinosaurs are more real... than most real families on TV.</p>
<p>Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!</p>
<p>Look, Maggie, they have a baby too.</p>
<p>It's like they saw our lives and put it up on screen.</p>
<p>Kids, I know you're excited... about meeting Aunt Selma's boyfriend.</p>
<p>Before he gets here...</p>
<p>I should tell you something about him--</p>
<p><em>something disturbing.</em></p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p>Ee-ugh!</p>
<p>Aunt Selma has this crazy obsession... about not dying alone... so in desperation... she joined this prison pen pal program.</p>
<p>Her new sweetie is a jailbird.</p>
<p><em>Cool, he can teach us...</em> how to k*ll a man with a lunch tray.</p>
<p><em>Now, now, he's an ex-convict.</em></p>
<p>He's paid his debt to society.</p>
<p>Then why aren't you using... the good silverware?</p>
<p><em>I'm just not.</em></p>
<p>That's them.</p>
<p>Remember, everyone... be understanding and forgiving... for the sake of family unity.</p>
<p><em>Everyone...</em></p>
<p>I'd like you to meet--</p>
<p>Aah! It's Sideshow Bob!</p>
<p>What the..?</p>
<p>I'm afraid their reaction is understandable.</p>
<p>Bart is the shamus in short pants who sent me to prison.</p>
<p>Your new boyfriend here framed Krusty the Clown... for armed robbery.</p>
<p>If some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison... the first thing out I'd find out where he lives... and tear him a new belly-button.</p>
<p>Lousy snitch.</p>
<p>Yaah!</p>
<p>You're forgetting the first two noble truths... of the Buddha.</p>
<p>I am not.</p>
<p>Yes, you are.</p>
<p>One: existence is suffering.</p>
<p>Two: the cause of suffering is desire-- in this case, my desire to do high-quality... children's programming.</p>
<p><em>When prison ended that dream, I became a seething cauldron... of rage and recrimination.</p>
<p>When I was nominated for best supporting performer... in a children's program at the Daytime Emmy Awards... my bitterness ruined the greatest night of my life.</em></p>
<p>And the nominees are: Droopy Drawers...</p>
<p>Colonel Coward...</p>
<p>Pepito, the biggest cat in the whole wide world...</p>
<p>Sideshow Bob... and Suckup the Vacuum.</p>
<p>And the Emmy goes to...</p>
<p>I don't believe this...</p>
<p>Sideshow Bob.</p>
<p>This is one more Emmy than you'll ever win... you bantering jack-in-the-box!</p>
<p>Just don't drop it in the shower.</p>
<p>No-talent, shill!</p>
<p>Second banana!</p>
<p>Panderer!</p>
<p>Bore!</p>
<p>Uh, now for the highlight of the evening--</p>
<p>Best film-to-video transfer.</p>
<p>Do you know what prison is like... for a life-long Republican?</p>
<p><em>In our overcrowded cell we became little more than beasts.</p>
<p>Who used my chap stick?</p>
<p>Oh, I did. Here you go.</em></p>
<p>I don't want it.</p>
<p><em>My only joy came with plotting a horrible revenge... against the boy who put me there.</p>
<p>Ay, caramba!</em></p>
<p>Bart, if I wanted to k*ll you...</p>
<p>I'd have choked you as soon as I walked in.</p>
<p>But what kind of guest would I have been?</p>
<p>Now, where was I?</p>
<p>Ah, yes-- my lowest ebb.</p>
<p>You can't take my Emmy.</p>
<p>You know the rules: awards for entertainment are contraband.</p>
<p>No Emmys, no Oscars, not even a Golden Globe.</p>
<p>But kismet be kind, well as cruel.</p>
<p><em>I received an answer to my letter... from the prison pen pal program.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear #2 460 1... I need a man and cannot find one... among the law abiding. I have a steady job and a lucrative hobby: filing nuisance lawsuits. I share an apartment with my twin sister. Enclosed is a photo of us on a tandem bike. I forget which one I am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dear Selma... your latest letter set off a riot... in the maximum-security wing of my heart.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Ohhh...</p>
<p>[ Pffft ]</p>
<p><em>Like the lone crocus that pokes through the prison yard... our love bloomed despite all obstacles.</em></p>
<p>Selma, may I?</p>
<p>Uh, uh, uh... on the cheek.</p>
<p><em>Inspired by the love of a good woman...</p>
<p>I resolved to be the best darned inmate #2 460 I I could be.</p>
<p>I bade farewell to my cellmates... and left with the woman I loved.</em></p>
<p>Cutter.</p>
<p>Icepick.</p>
<p>Snake.</p>
<p>I'm going to miss you most of all.</p>
<p>Aww!</p>
<p>What a beautiful story, Sideshow Bob.</p>
<p>You're living proof that our revolving-door prison system works.</p>
<p>I've never seen you so happy-- giggling like a schoolgirl.</p>
<p>I've got to admit it, Selma... he's a once-in-a-lifetime catch.</p>
<p>I hope the police are saying that as well.</p>
<p>I can't believe you guys.</p>
<p>This man framed Krusty the Clown.</p>
<p>Bart!</p>
<p>Indeed, I did... and I thank you for catching me.</p>
<p>You seized the wheel... of my slow boat to hell, and pointed it... towards the sunny shores of Selma.</p>
<p>Here, here.</p>
<p>Would you mind... if I did something bold and shocking... in front of your family?</p>
<p>All right, but no tongues.</p>
<p>Though kissing you is like kissing some divine ashtray... that's not what I had in mind.</p>
<p>Selma, will you marry me?</p>
<p>[ Gasps ]</p>
<p>Don't be a fool. That man is scum.</p>
<p>Then call me &quot;Mrs. Scum.&quot;</p>
<p>Could you... pumice my corns for me?</p>
<p><em>Avec plaisir.</em></p>
<p>&quot;A&quot;... &quot;G&quot;...</p>
<p>&quot;Q&quot;... Seven...</p>
<p>Close enough. May you drive safely... and find true love.</p>
<p>We now return to...</p>
<p>Whoo-hoo! I love you people!</p>
<p>I love my kids!</p>
<p>Poor little guys.</p>
<p>So tragic.</p>
<p>So nauseous.</p>
<p>You should see the bus they came to the studio in.</p>
<p>What's next? Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>And now, a man who needs no introduction...</p>
<p>&quot;The Chairman of the Company&quot;-- you know who I'm talking about.</p>
<p><em>Get out here, you gumba!</em> who wants to say hello.</p>
<p><em>Huh? What?</p>
<p>I can't believe it!</p>
<p>They've been feuding for years.</em></p>
<p>Come here, you.</p>
<p>Oh, you old clown, you.</p>
<p>I missed you.</p>
<p>This guy is a national treasure.</p>
<p>That jerk I got to replace you, he isn't fit to hold your slide whistle.</p>
<p>All I can be is myself.</p>
<p>Krusty, can you ever forgive me for putting you in jail?</p>
<p>If they open the books on this telethon I'm right back in there.</p>
<p>That Sideshow Bob is a no-good show biz phony.</p>
<p>Come on, Bart.</p>
<p>If Krusty can find it in his heart to forgive him surely you can too.</p>
<p><em> Now, about your wedding dress...</em> how should I put this?</p>
<p>White!</p>
<p>White.</p>
<p>What would you like for appetizers?</p>
<p>Ooh, appetizers.</p>
<p>Homer, you're a trencherman.</p>
<p>What should we serve?</p>
<p>Well, you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies.</p>
<p>They taste as good as they look... and they come in this delicious red sauce.</p>
<p>It looks like ketchup, it tastes like ketchup... but, brother, it ain't ketchup!</p>
<p>Selma, he makes a good case.</p>
<p>Whatever you want.</p>
<p>It all tastes like Styrofoam to me.</p>
<p>Selma, dear, I'm confused.</p>
<p>When I was a kid... we were playing with bottle rockets... and one sh*t straight up my nose.</p>
<p>I permanently lost my sense of taste and smell.</p>
<p>Okay, we've got cocktail weenies and Swedish meatballs.</p>
<p>Selma, this wedding is spinning out of control.</p>
<p>I've run through eight of the ten dollars... they gave me when I left prison.</p>
<p>I told you I got money.</p>
<p>I bought stock in a Mace company... just before society crumbled.</p>
<p>Selma, that's wonderful! I hope people don't think...</p>
<p><em>I'm marrying you for your money...</em> instead of your... less tangible qualities.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we'll be Mr. and Mrs. Bob Terwilliger.</p>
<p>Isn't it grand?</p>
<p>Hey, Bob, give some of that honey this way.</p>
<p>Mmm... mmm!</p>
<p><em>Holy frijoles! We've got ten minutes till MacGyver.</em></p>
<p>Driver, here's a fin. Get me home, and don't spare the whip.</p>
<p>Whatever you say, mum.</p>
<p><em>What did I miss?</em></p>
<p>MacGyver was wearing a t*nk top.</p>
<p>Dang.</p>
<p>But I'm the only man in your life.</p>
<p>Sit down and shut up!</p>
<p>Señor MacGyver, you saved our village.</p>
<p><em>Don't thank me.</p>
<p>Thank the moon's gravitational pull.</em></p>
<p>That MacGyver's a genius.</p>
<p>First of all, he's not a genius. He's an actor.</p>
<p>And second, he's not much of an actor.</p>
<p>You're lying. You're lying!</p>
<p><em>No, this is lying--</em> that was a well-plotted piece of non-claptrap... that never made me retch.</p>
<p><em>No!</em></p>
<p>He was so cruel.</p>
<p>The things he said... they're just not true.</p>
<p>There. There.</p>
<p>The wedding's off.</p>
<p>Fiddle-dee-dee. Tomorrow's another day.</p>
<p>Bart, stop that!</p>
<p>No, he's right.</p>
<p>We're a package.</p>
<p><em>Love me, love MacGyver.</em></p>
<p>I guess the wedding's off.</p>
<p>Selma, I don't know what to say.</p>
<p><em>Just tell me you like MacGyver.</em></p>
<p>Very well.</p>
<p>I-- I--</p>
<p>I can't do it! Even that car chase seemed tacked on.</p>
<p>Would you two knock it off?</p>
<p>I hate all the programs Marge likes... but it's no big deal.</p>
<p>You know why?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content"><br />

<p>Whenever Marge puts on... one of her nonviolent programs, I take a walk.</p>
<p>I go to a bar, I pound a few... then I stumble home in the mood for love.</p>
<p>Very well, Selma.</p>
<p><em>Whenever you watch MacGyver...</em></p>
<p>I'll take a vigorous constitutional... and return more in love than ever.</p>
<p>Oh, Bob.</p>
<p>Bart no like.</p>
<p>Bad medicine.</p>
<p>I could have been the flower girl... and I wouldn't keep falling down either.</p>
<p>Hey, they chose Maggie, okay?</p>
<p>If you want to go for cutesyness... instead of competence, fine.</p>
<p>Do you, Bob, take Selma... to have and to hold, in sickness and in health...</p>
<p><em>till death do you part?</em></p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Hey, wiener boy...</p>
<p><em>where do you think you're going?</em></p>
<p>I'm the only single girl left in the family.</p>
<p>Well, I guess it could be worse.</p>
<p>Oh, there's Krusty the Clown.</p>
<p>Krusty!</p>
<p>Krusty, say something funny.</p>
<p>Oh, gee, a joke, huh?</p>
<p>Um... uh... funny.</p>
<p>Okay, this guy walks into a bar... and takes out a tiny piano and a I 2-inch pianist--</p>
<p>Oh, no, wait. I can't tell that one.</p>
<p>Dear friends, 41 years ago...</p>
<p>God took I 68 pounds of clay, and he made me a woman... and for this, I thank him.</p>
<p>I just wanted to say... on the advice of my new husband...</p>
<p>I've decided to give up smoking...</p>
<p><em>except for after meals and after MacGyver.</em></p>
<p>Selma, dear, you'll bury us all.</p>
<p>Chief Wiggum, you've been around.</p>
<p>You don't trust Sideshow Bob, do you?</p>
<p>Lighten up, son. If he was going to commit a crime... would he have invited the number-one cop in town?</p>
<p>Now, where did I put my g*n?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. I set it down when I got some cake.</p>
<p>I don't know what to say.</p>
<p>Just tell me what you know I want to hear.</p>
<p>I'm dying of jealousy.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>That's right, dear.</p>
<p>Enjoy your rest.</p>
<p>The wedding was very tough on you... and the honeymoon is going to be... m*rder.</p>
<p>Welcome to our video honeymoon.</p>
<p>We're using the video camera cousin Doug gave us... and the videocassette Homer gave us.</p>
<p>Hey, and after we watch this, we can tape over it.</p>
<p>There's Shelbyville Falls, Rolling Rock... and here's another breathtaking sight... my brand-new hubby.</p>
<p>I wanted a room with a fireplace... you brainless luggage monkey!</p>
<p>Like the one in your brochure!</p>
<p>Oh, Selma, dear.</p>
<p>I was just chatting with my good friend... Dennis.</p>
<p>Now, smile for the camera, that's a good lad.</p>
<p>Ah, fire--</p>
<p>Scourge of Prometheus, toaster of marshmallows... eradicator of deadwood.</p>
<p>Oh, Selma, dear-- you and your little camera.</p>
<p>What do you say we shut it off for a while?</p>
<p>And make love?</p>
<p>I suppose so.</p>
<p><em>Oh, that's sweet.</em></p>
<p>Why would Sideshow Bob go so nuts over a fireplace?</p>
<p>Because he wants his honeymoon... to be romantic.</p>
<p>Romantic? With Aunt Selma?</p>
<p>I guess you're too young to understand.</p>
<p>Hmm...</p>
<p>Bob, one of my fillings fell out.</p>
<p>Even m*rder has its ugly side.</p>
<p>Bob, would you mind rubbing my feet?</p>
<p>Darling, you make it sound like a chore.</p>
<p>Ooh. Oh. Good. Mmm.</p>
<p>Soon I will k*ll you.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p><em>Son pieds sentit beau--</em></p>
<p>French for &quot;her foot smells lovely.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Prepare to be m*rder.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>That's... Sanskrit for &quot;your toes are like perfume.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Voy a matar a usted.</p>
<p>Wha?</em></p>
<p>That's Spanish for &quot;I am going to k*ll you.&quot;</p>
<p>Say what?</p>
<p>I do believe it's time...</p>
<p><em>for your beloved MacGyver.</em></p>
<p>Oh, hey, you're right.</p>
<p>Well, time for my walk.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Don't forget to die.</p>
<p>Ding-dong.</p>
<p>I was feeling kind of lonely without Selma.</p>
<p>Mind if I watch TVwith you?</p>
<p>Oh, go ahead, Patty.</p>
<p><em>Tonight, on MacGyver...</em></p>
<p>MacGyver...</p>
<p>MacGyver...</p>
<p>MacGyver...</p>
<p>Aunt Selma has one hour to live.</p>
<p>Hey, down in front.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
<p>Front desk, there's been a terrible accident in my room!</p>
<p>Poor Selma. You were having... such a lovely evening...</p>
<p>Selma! Oh!</p>
<p>You tried to k*ll me.</p>
<p>I want a separation.</p>
<p><em>My best-laid plans have gang agley.</em></p>
<p>Do you have room in your jail... for a two-time loser?</p>
<p>No, but that never stopped us before.</p>
<p>Bart, I must know... how did you untangle my web?</p>
<p>Yeah, Bart, clue us in.</p>
<p>I'd hate to tell the number-one cop in town... how to do his job.</p>
<p>No, please, it's the only way I'll learn.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p><em>Sideshow Bob seemed desperate... to get that fireplace, but why?</p>
<p>Then it hit me--</p>
<p>The gas!</p>
<p>Surely anyone would have noticed a gas leak... except Aunt Selma.</p>
<p>I permanently lost my sense of smell.</p>
<p>She happily watched MacGyver... unaware that her room... was silently filling with natural gas.</p>
<p>All it needed to explode... was a single spark, say, from a cigarette.</p>
<p>I've decided... to give up smoking... except after meals and MacGyver.</p>
<p>Her only hope was a plucky young boy and his slow-witted father.</p>
<p>When Aunt Selma lights up after MacGyver...</em> she'll be blown to kingdom come.</p>
<p>Come again?</p>
<p><em>After trying four times to explain it to Homer...</p>
<p>I explained it to Mom and we were on our way!</em></p>
<p>To the Simpson Mobile!</p>
<p>But wait. If you saved Selma, why did the room explode?</p>
<p>Oh, I'll field that one.</p>
<p>Oh, right, the gas. with all my criminal buddies!</p>
<p>I feel like such a fool.</p>
<p>Well, he fooled almost everyone... but there was one little boy who never lost his mistrust.</p>
<p>Thanks, Mom.</p>
<p>Now, let's get out of this gas-filled hallway... before we all suffocate.</p>
<p>Shh.</p>
