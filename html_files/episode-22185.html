<p>Children, I'm sorry to say one of your lunches expl*ded.</p>
<p>Who has the Little Bunny FooFoo lunchbox?</p>
<p>Um... That would be me.</p>
<p>(ALL LAUGHING)</p>
<p>It's not my fault. I can't afford a better lunchbox 'cause I'm poor.</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Shut up! My mom got too fat to work at Hooters!</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>They won't even let her park cars!</p>
<p>Please, children. Don't be cruel.</p>
<p>Nelson might be poor but I'm sure he has the seven dollars for today's field trip. Um...</p>
<p>Well, actually...</p>
<p>(BRAKES SQUEAL)</p>
<p>(CHILDREN LAUGHING)</p>
<p>(SOBBING)</p>
<p>Someday...</p>
<p>Now, I know the rest of us are excited about visiting the Museum of Television today.</p>
<p>Hey, don't tell us how to feel!</p>
<p>Bart Simpson, be quiet!</p>
<p>Hey, that wasn't me. That was... Milhouse?</p>
<p>Milhouse? What happened to my little class coward?</p>
<p>What do you care, Mrs. Krabappel?</p>
<p>Or should I say &quot;Mrs. Crab Apple?&quot; Ha-ha!</p>
<p>&quot;Crab Apple?&quot;</p>
<p>I never thought of that.</p>
<p>It totally works.</p>
<p>Oh, how could I have been so blind?</p>
<p>(SINGING) Rollin', rollin', rollin'</p>
<p>Toxic barrel rollin'</p>
<p>They're so hot and glowin'</p>
<p>We'll d*e.</p>
<p>Smithers, the board of directors is coming here today.</p>
<p>I don't want them to see Snap, Crackle, and Pop down there.</p>
<p>Sir, there's a big cardboard box out back that could keep them amused.</p>
<p>They could make a fort. No, no.</p>
<p>Just give them each a nickel and send them to Moe's.</p>
<p>Let them while away the afternoon spilling their beer on gullets and trousers while drooling over French postcards.</p>
<p>(GIGGLES)</p>
<p>Hello, I'm lsabel Sanford, the beloved Weezy from The Jeffersons.</p>
<p>At this &quot;museum,&quot; you won't see a Michelangelo, but you might see Michael Landon and Beverly D'Angelo.</p>
<p>This blows. Let's sneak off.</p>
<p>Wander away from the group?</p>
<p>Man, you've been huffing from the Bart bag.</p>
<p>To old man Burns, who's paying us to drink because we're embarrassing.</p>
<p>We suck! We suck!</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>A lot of that went in my lungs.</p>
<p>Attention, American bar devils.</p>
<p>It's our anniversary. Free drinks for everyone.</p>
<p>That's great! I'm honored to drink to Apu and... Apu-lina.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>You know, Marge and I have an anniversary coming up.</p>
<p>I have given Manjula many gifts including a bouquet of flowers, diamond earrings, and we're going to see Paris Hilton in Paris.</p>
<p>Texas... On our way to Paris... France.</p>
<p>What did you plan to get your wife, Homer?</p>
<p>Well, these charity address labels that came in the mail.</p>
<p>Milhouse, why are you acting so crazy?</p>
<p>Did your imaginary friend try to k*ll you again?</p>
<p>No. Walter's been cool.</p>
<p>(SIGHS) Bart, I gotta say something. And it's not easy.</p>
<p>Well, if it's not easy, don't do it. That's how I got where I am.</p>
<p>Then let's just say I don't care what people think of me anymore.</p>
<p>You mean, up until now you did care?</p>
<p>Then why did you wear that tutu to school last week?</p>
<p>What about all the times I didn't wear a tutu?</p>
<p>Nobody ever brings those up! Now leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: It's the Paul Lynde, Helen Reddy, Hudson Brothers Easter Special, with guest stars Willie Tyler and Lester, and Nadia Comaneci.</p>
<p>I'd like to hippity-hop on your balance beam.</p>
<p>I don't think you understand the mechanics of heterosexual sex.</p>
<p>Well, circle gets the square.</p>
<p>TV sure has come a long way, huh, Milhouse?</p>
<p>(MILHOUSE LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Check it out! I'm riding some guy named lronside!</p>
<p>Ow, my banana! Danger, danger.</p>
<p>Door ajar. The indignity.</p>
<p>The agents got all my money.</p>
<p>(NEIGHING)</p>
<p>I'm bored. Let's go switch the heads on the Cosby kids.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: I don't want to go home. I'm not done talking to me.</p>
<p>Just get out this door, rummy, and you're the city's problem.</p>
<p>If you make it through the night, you're welcome back.</p>
<p>Ah. Home sweet home. Now to watch some TV.</p>
<p>(RAT SQUEAKS)</p>
<p>Oh... You poor soul. You think that rat is a remote.</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>What? Five bucks?</p>
<p>I don't need your &quot;sharity.&quot;</p>
<p>(SQUEAKING)</p>
<p>I'll dance for my money!</p>
<p>(SINGING DRUNKENLY)</p>
<p>Oh, you poor man. You think you can dance.</p>
<p>I didn't say stop.</p>
<p>(CONTINUES SINGING DRUNKENLY)</p>
<p>Bart, there's something I gotta tell you.</p>
<p>I'm moving.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>My mom got a job in Capitol City.</p>
<p>Capitol City? You can't move that far. You're my best friend!</p>
<p>What's your mom making? I'll match it!</p>
<p>It's too late, Bart. My mom's already transferred her 401 K.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Luann, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Look, Kirk. I need a fresh start.</p>
<p>Well, couldn't you get a fresh start by re-marrying your old husband?</p>
<p>Kirk, we are going.</p>
<p>Fine. But you can't take Milhouse. I have visitation rights.</p>
<p>Yes. And you're also supposed to pay child support!</p>
<p>Hey, I thought you said my money was no good.</p>
<p>I said you're no good.</p>
<p>Get in the car, Milhouse.</p>
<p>This isn't over! I'll fight you with every lunch half-hour I get!</p>
<p>Oh! Speaking of which... (HUMMING) it's gonna be tough to be peppy today.</p>
<p>Tell me about it.</p>
<p>(KIRK SIGHS)</p>
<p>(TIRES SQUEAL)</p>
<p>(MARGE GROANS)</p>
<p>Why are your clothes so dirty?</p>
<p>And why do you smell like liquor? Have you been clubbing?</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>Homie, they're beautiful.</p>
<p>That Chevron Station has the most romantic bouquets.</p>
<p>I feel a swoon coming on. (GASPS)</p>
<p>Here it is.</p>
<p>I am so wasted.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Oh, my God. We're having a simultaneous pass out!</p>
<p>Well, at least they're not fighting.</p>
<p>(ITCHY &amp; SCRATCHY SHOW THEME PLAYING)</p>
<p>Oh! Mmm-mmm.</p>

<p>What's on the menu?</p>

<p>(SCRATCHY GRUNTING)</p>
<p>(SIGHS)</p>
<p>(GROANING)</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Oh, Bart, I'm sure it's hard to lose your best friend.</p>
<p>You mean Milhouse? Funny little guy.</p>
<p>Afraid of the dark and the light.</p>
<p>Now I've got new friends. Guys who get me.</p>
<p>(DOORBELL RINGS)</p>
<p>There's one right now.</p>
<p>Who is it? Is it Ralph?</p>
<p>It is not Ralph.</p>
<p>Hi, Bart. My nose makes its own bubble gum.</p>
<p>Just get in here!</p>
<p>...18, 19, 20.</p>
<p>I found you, Bart!</p>
<p>Ralph, we're playing checkers.</p>
<p>I don't like you, Boy-Mommy!</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Oh, loveless loners are so lucky.</p>
<p>There's no way I can afford to give Marge a nice anniversary present.</p>
<p>Oh... You poor man. You smell worse than you did last time.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Hey, buddy, that's nice sign work.</p>
<p>Your penmanship is clear, yet sad.</p>
<p>Hey, I know you.</p>
<p>We met in a police lineup.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah. You know, number two and number four are an item now?</p>
<p>You don't have to tell me, I was number three.</p>
<p>Listen, you have any pointers for a newbie?</p>
<p>Well, there are six schools of begging.</p>
<p>Bad musician, messed up vet, cripple, fake cripple, religious zealot, and crazy guy.</p>
<p>I think you would do well with crazy guy.</p>
<p>Coke and Pepsi are the same thing! Wake up, people!</p>
<p>(BABBLING)</p>
<p>Wow. Now that is good crazy.</p>
<p>(SNIFFS)</p>
<p>(SIGHS)</p>
<p>Oh, no. Oh, no! Oh, no!</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p>Oh, yes!</p>
<p>I never thought I'd have to take a plane to see Milhouse.</p>
<p>Well, I'm sure he'll be happy you came.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: (OVER INTERCOM) Now departing, No-Frills Airlines Flight 89.</p>
<p>(PEOPLE SCREAMING)</p>
<p>Milhouse, Bart's here.</p>
<p>What up, B?</p>
<p>Milhouse? Ls that you?</p>
<p>Yeah. I gave my looks a new flava.</p>
<p>Suck it in!</p>
<p>Uh... Maybe later.</p>
<p>(DOORBELL RINGS)</p>
<p>What up, M-life?</p>
<p>Milhouse, this isn't you.</p>
<p>This is my only chance to be cool!</p>
<p>Now please, let me give you a wedgie in front of these guys.</p>
<p>No way!</p>
<p>Please? I'll be gentle.</p>
<p>Oh, fine.</p>
<p>Wedgie!</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Milhouse, you went Cap City on him.</p>
<p>Springfield baby in a diaper, poked his eye with a windshield wiper.</p>
<p>Springfield baby!</p>
<p>I'll always love you, Bart.</p>
<p>Springfield baby!</p>
<p>(CHOKING)</p>
<p>(BOTH LAUGHING)</p>
<p>(SOBBING)</p>
<p>Bart, honey, it's a nice day. Why don't you play outside?</p>
<p>Outside? That's where me and Milhouse played.</p>
<p>(SNIFFLING) Hmm.</p>
<p>You know, I think your sister could use a little help washing the car.</p>
<p>You'll be like an owl saying, &quot;Milhouse who?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Milhouse who? Milhouse who?&quot;</p>
<p>Hey, Moldilocks. Mom says I'm supposed to help you.</p>
<p>Fine. You can confirm the accuracy of the hose.</p>
<p>(YELLING) (LAUGHING)</p>
<p>You wet your pants!</p>
<p>Shut up! It's a serious problem!</p>
<p>Lise, you are so d*ad.</p>
<p>(YELLS)</p>
<p>I'm gonna hit you so hard I'll k*ll your whole family.</p>
<p>Bart, you're in my family.</p>
<p>Shut up!</p>
<p>(BOTH LAUGHING)</p>
<p>(EXCLAIMS)</p>
<p>Homie, I'd like to know what you've been doing after work.</p>
<p>Marge, I'm not gonna lie to you.</p>
<p>(GRUMBLES)</p>
<p>I also found this in your drawer.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>All the answers you need are in here.</p>
<p>Happy anniversary.</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>Are these Diamonique? Nope.</p>
<p>Diamondelle? Nope.</p>
<p>Cubic Diamondium? Nope.</p>
<p>Dioxy-ribo-diamondoid?</p>
<p>Close but no cigar.</p>
<p>Just plain diamonds!</p>
<p>Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</p>
<p>We finally have something to put in the wall safe.</p>
<p>Hostess Twinkies?</p>
<p>I heard if you age them for 1 0 years, they turn to liquor.</p>
<p>Kids, go ride bikes for a while, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, you heard your mother.</p>
<p>We can't jump this ditch.</p>
<p>Sure we can.</p>
<p>But let me go first.</p>
<p>Everyone knows you're the future of this family.</p>
<p>That's not true, Bart.</p>
<p>Mom and Dad value us equally and...</p>
<p>Ah, you're right. Okay, go ahead.</p>
<p>Geronimo!</p>
<p>(WHIMPERS)</p>
<p>Just forget everything you know about gravity.</p>
<p>But I know so much about it.</p>
<p>Just do it!</p>
<p>Geronimo!</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>We can go inside.</p>
<p>Ooh! We're like Howard Carter discovering the Temple of t*nk.</p>
<p>Or like when I discovered the school Xerox code. I -4-7.</p>
<p>Just saying it makes my butt feel warm again.</p>
<p>(GASPS) Arrowheads!</p>
<p>(GASPS) Pictographs! Bart, this is a Native American burial mound.</p>
<p>(LAUGHS) Look! He's picking his nose.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING)</p>
<p>Hey, we shouldn't tell anyone we were here.</p>
<p>This place should be our special secret.</p>
<p>Okay. Shake.</p>
<p>(WHIMPERS)</p>
<p>Psych!</p>
<p>There's spiders in your hair.</p>
<p>That's what you call commitment to a bit.</p>

<p>Mr. Bo-jangles.</p>
<p>We're all Bo-Jangles.</p>
<p>Who k*ll Bo-Jangles?</p>
<p>Maybe it was you.</p>
<p>Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p>Remember, my dog up and d*ed. Thank you.</p>
<p>You got your wife the earrings, man. Why are you still doing this?</p>
<p>I want to get a second house, closer to work.</p>
<p>He's taking all our business. We're gonna have to do something.</p>
<p>We never do anything. That's why we're bums.</p>
<p>Hey, you're a woman.</p>
<p>And you're a three-headed devil dog! Devil dog!</p>
<p>Wanna make out?</p>
<p>No one wants to be alone.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: &quot;The mound builders&quot;</p>

<p>Thank God we've come to our senses and worship a carpenter who lived 2,000 years ago.</p>
<p>(TELEPHONE RINGING)</p>
<p>Hi, Janey.</p>
<p>Branford Marsalis' car broke down outside your house?</p>
<p>And he's just jamming till Wynton shows up?</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>Um...</p>
<p>Some other time maybe.</p>
<p>Today I'm just hanging out at home.</p>
<p>(DOORBELL RINGS)</p>
<p>Hey, Bart. I &quot;borrowed&quot; my uncle's pellet g*n.</p>
<p>You want to go sh**t Apu?</p>
<p>Oh, that does sound fun.</p>
<p>But not today. I think I'm just gonna hang out at home.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. My brother's my best friend!</p>
<p>Oh, my God! My sister's my best friend!</p>
<p>Diamonds. I still can't believe he gave me diamonds.</p>
<p>Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the baldest of them all?</p>
<p>One time, I swung all the way around.</p>
<p>You did not.</p>
<p>Well, I know a guy who did.</p>
<p>Who? You don't know him. He lives in Russia.</p>
<p>I can't believe they're hanging out.</p>
<p>Ha! Maybe she'll be a good influence on him.</p>
<p>Or maybe he'll corrupt her.</p>
<p>It won't last.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters are natural enemies, like Englishmen and Scots, or Welshmen and Scots, or Japanese and Scots, or Scots and other Scots.</p>
<p>Damn Scots! They ruined Scotland!</p>
<p>You Scots sure are a contentious people.</p>
<p>You just made an enemy for life!</p>
<p>Listen, Mr. Hobo, you may not have laundry to wash, but I do.</p>
<p>Now what do you want to show me?</p>
<p>There's your husband, aka Mooch-a-lini, Drooly McGee, Corporal Flashback, etcetera, etcetera.</p>
<p>Homer! (SCREAMS)</p>
<p>You're panhandling!</p>
<p>I should've known from that panhandling sign, plus that ticket you got for panhandling.</p>
<p>But, Marge, it was all for you, to buy you all the nice things you deserve.</p>
<p>The flowers, the earrings, the Bob Seger boxed set, which really only needed to be one disk, but the box was nice!</p>
<p>Homer, I don't need fancy things.</p>
<p>And even if I did, this is the wrong way to get them.</p>
<p>And to remind you of what you've done, I'm gonna keep these earrings and wear them at social occasions.</p>
<p>I don't understand.</p>
<p>Well, then maybe you need to buy me a broach.</p>
<p>Bart, I cracked the code of the pictograph.</p>
<p>It says there's a curse on the mound.</p>
<p>Of course I don't believe it... (SCREAMS)</p>
<p>Hi, Lisa.</p>
<p>I brought you the Cap City version of Monopoly.</p>
<p>Baltic Avenue is now Wayne Street.</p>
<p>It's awesome!</p>
<p>Milhouse, I thought your mom took you away forever.</p>
<p>I got a court order bringing him back.</p>
<p>The judge said I was the most pathetic person he'd ever seen in court.</p>
<p>Pity custody. Boo-yah!</p>
<p>(VOCALIZING)</p>
<p>Repo man. I'm here to take your pants.</p>
<p>Not in front of my son. Please!</p>
<p>You're somebody's father?</p>
<p>Yes, okay?</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>Well, I'm glad to be back.</p>
<p>Those Cap City kids don't think I'm cool anymore.</p>
<p>We were having a sleepover and a robber came and wet my bed.</p>
<p>Then he folded the bed back into the couch and disappeared into the night.</p>
<p>I knew you'd blow it. Now let me show you that mound.</p>
<p>You told him our secret?</p>
<p>Hey, he's my best friend.</p>
<p>Oh. I see how it is.</p>
<p>Great. Then we're all cool.</p>
<p>(SOBBING)</p>
<p>Since he's been back, Milhouse has had three bloody noses and stepped in dog doo.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES) it's always a party with that guy.</p>
<p>Well, it's nice you have your best friend back.</p>
<p>You should hang with us sometime, Lise.</p>
<p>Mmm-hmm. I think I'll go to bed now.</p>
<p>What's wrong? Nothing.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES) Boy, are you in trouble.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>When a woman says nothing's wrong, that means everything's wrong.</p>
<p>And when a woman says everything's wrong, that means everything's wrong.</p>
<p>And when a woman says something's not funny, you'd better not laugh your ass off.</p>
<p>Hey, Lise, you want to play Cap City Monopoly?</p>
<p>Look, just because Milhouse is gone, doesn't mean you have to pretend to be my friend.</p>
<p>Oh, come on. I'll roll the dice for you.</p>
<p>Three, four, five, chance. Pick up a card.</p>
<p>Sheesh.</p>
<p>(LISA READING)</p>
<p>What? Really?</p>
<p>Yep. Pick up another one.</p>
<p>But it's not my turn.</p>
<p>I'm trying to do something nice, you dink. Pick up a card.</p>
<p>&quot;Bart will defend you when other kids call you a nerd.&quot;</p>
<p>No one calls me a nerd.</p>
<p>Trust me, that is a valuable card. Pick up another.</p>
<p>&quot;Bart will give back the Malibu Stacy head you thought was lost.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, Bart, that's really sweet.</p>
<p>Just because I have Milhouse back doesn't mean I haven't learned a few things about being a brother.</p>
<p>I think I'm gonna use this card right now.</p>
<p>Oh... Do I have to?</p>
<p>Mmm-hmm. (SIGHS)</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>This is what sitcoms call a &quot;schmaltzy ending,&quot; a sentimental capper to leave the aud*ence feeling good.</p>
<p>Usually followed by a little coda to cut the treacle.</p>
<p>Granny, I'm gonna sh**t me some Vietcong.</p>
<p>Yeah? Well, I ain't cooking 'em.</p>
<p>(AUd*eNCE LAUGHING)</p>
<p>And George Jefferson, wherever you are, we love you and want you to come home.</p>
<p>Well, we're movin' on up.</p>
<p>Movin' on up.</p>
<p>To the east side.</p>
<p>Movin' on up.</p>
<p>To a deluxe apartment in the sky.</p>
<p>Movin' on up (Chorus) Movin' on up.</p>
<p>To the east side.</p>
<p>Movin' on up.</p>
<p>We finally got a piece of the pie.</p>
<p>Fish don't fry in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Beans don't burn on the grill.</p>
<p>Took a whole lotta tryin'</p>
<p>Just to get up that hill.</p>
<p>Now we're up in the big leagues.</p>
<p>Gettin' our turn at bat.</p>
<p>As long as we live, it's you and me, baby.</p>
<p>There ain't nothin' wrong with that.</p>
<p>Well, we're movin on up.</p>
<p>Movin' on up.</p>
<p>To the east side.</p>
<p>Movin' on up.</p>
<p>To a deluxe apartment in the sky.</p>
