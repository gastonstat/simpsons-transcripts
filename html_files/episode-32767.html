<p>♪  </p>
<p>ANNOUNCER: <em>Intramural softball,</em>  </p>
<p><em>where even the most overweight tubbo</em>  </p>
<p><em>can pretend to be an athlete.</em>   </p>
<p>(dramatic music plays)   </p>
<p>Play ball!   </p>
<p>(drunken clamoring)   </p>
<p>You play ball!   </p>
<p>- Hey! Oh!<br />
- Hey! Oh! This guy!   </p>
<p>Those Indian Point Nuclear jerks,   </p>
<p>they think they're so great because their fallout radius includes Manhattan.   </p>
<p>How many Mets games can you postpone?   </p>
<p>Fuggettabowtit!   </p>
<p>- Hey! - Oh!<br />
- Pizza!   </p>
<p>- Tattoos!<br />
- Verrazano Bridge!   </p>
<p>Everyone is so out of shape.   </p>
<p>It's like watching maple syrup play softball.   </p>
<p>Yeah, Dad hit a home run five minutes ago and he's still rounding second.   </p>
<p>(dramatic music plays)   </p>
<p>Let's just call it a triple.   </p>
<p>Oh. (grunts)   </p>
<p>The triple, the most exciting play in baseball.   </p>
<p>Except this time.   </p>
<p>Fun fact: the odds of a baseball hitting a bird are one in a billion, but I've seen it four times.   </p>
<p>- (crowd cheering)<br />
- MAN: We're out of beer!   </p>
<p>Burnsie, old buddy, you care for a cigar?   </p>
<p>Oh, thanks, but no.   </p>
<p>If I inhale warmed air, I tend to float away.   </p>
<p>(sighs) You ever think we're watching the last generation of nukemen?   </p>
<p>No one wants to go into this dirty business anymore.   </p>
<p>Fiddle-faddle, nuclear power is the industry of tomorrow.   </p>
<p>Oh, yeah? Says who?   </p>
<p>Life magazine, The Saturday Evening Stenograph,   </p>
<p>and Professor Noodle Stroodle and the Dove Soap March of Comedy.   </p>
<p>Me? I'm thinking of getting into, uh, to solar.   </p>
<p>I won't use it myself, I'll sell it to the poor people and the musicians.   </p>
<p>Oh, not me.   </p>
<p>I vow that nuclear power will continue long after my body is gone   </p>
<p>and my brain is in a shark that can walk on land.   </p>
<p>I'll educate a new generation of nuclear workers.   </p>
<p>And I'll find those bright-eyed radio-activists at my alma mater: Yale.   </p>
<p>(grunts)   </p>
<p>(horn honks)   </p>
<p>Hey! Yo!   </p>
<p>- I'm eatin' Mister Softee over here!<br />
- (horn honks)   </p>
<p>Hey, kayak on the Hudson!   </p>
<p>(tires screech)   </p>
<p>It's always wonderful   </p>
<p>when a successful...   </p>
<p>- And childless.<br />
- alumnus returns.   </p>
<p>It's delightful how you take turns sniffing after my money.   </p>
<p>Now here's a group that was established in     .   </p>
<p>Pfft. I hate modern music.   </p>
<p>♪ To the tables down at Mory's ♪   </p>
<p>♪ To the place where Louie dwells ♪   </p>
<p>♪ To the dear old Temple Bar ♪   </p>
<p>♪ We love so well. ♪   </p>
<p>(chuckles) The Whiffenpoofs.   </p>
<p>I'll buy you a new library if you have them k*ll.   </p>
<p>So many have tried to k*ll them.   </p>
<p>But other smug jackasses in white gloves would just take their place.   </p>
<p>♪ We can't be stopped.   </p>
<p>Well, I am here to offer you money.   </p>
<p>I'd like to endow a Department of Nuclear Plant Management.   </p>
<p>Wonderful.   </p>
<p>Of course we can't do nuclear.   </p>
<p>Our students are highly-entitled wusses.   </p>
<p>You'd be creating a space for violence to happen.   </p>
<p>How about funding a chair in the non-narrative cinema of self-identified pan-sexuals?   </p>
<p>What? What? What? What? What?!   </p>
<p>We also need to hire more deans to decide which Halloween costumes are appropriate.   </p>
<p>Eight deans should do it.   </p>
<p>(sputters) Is this still a coven of capitalism where evil money can acquire a patina of virtue?   </p>
<p>Yes, that's in our charter.   </p>
<p>But with an issue as hetero-patriarchal   </p>
<p>as nuclear power, we'll have to hire multicultural empathizers, build a new safe space.   </p>
<p>Not so fast.   </p>
<p>We insist on a chair of anti-nuclear studies and a nuclear-neutral curriculum pathway.    </p>
<p>Absolutely, Teddy.    </p>
<p>We run all decisions past the squash team.    </p>
<p>Also the fencing team, water polo and Handsome Dan the mascot.    </p>
<p>(goofy laughter)    </p>
<p>Release me, you hound.    </p>
<p>(goofy laughter)    </p>
<p>Oh, yeah.    </p>
<p>What's happened to this place?    </p>
<p>(dramatic sting playing)    </p>
<p>(gasps)    </p>
<p>(gasps)    </p>
<p>This was the home of ruthless media disruptor Samuel F.B. Morse.    </p>
<p>Who's his successor? That fellow?    </p>
<p>&quot;Fellow&quot;? That word is cis-gender-normative, okay?    </p>
<p>You're worse than h*tler!    </p>
<p>Too late for flattery.    </p>
<p>I'm not giving this school a dime.    </p>
<p>Former Bonesman!    </p>
<p>MAN: Living or dead?    </p>
<p>Living, but you'd better hurry.    </p>
<p>Engage cloaking device.    </p>
<p>Ah, nothing relaxes me like a stiff drink from the skull of Martin Van Buren.    </p>
<p>Care for some Pancho Villa?    </p>
<p>Ugh. Has everything in this school surrendered to diversity?    </p>
<p>Yale's on its way out.    </p>
<p>That's why I started my own line of colleges.    </p>
<p>    campuses.    </p>
<p>We took over all the old Circuit Citys.    </p>
<p>Really?    </p>
<p>Using teachers these holier than thou Ivies fired for cause.    </p>
<p>I celebrated Columbus Day.    </p>
<p>I, uh, referred to God as &quot;He.&quot;    </p>
<p>I got five students pregnant.    </p>
<p>Hmm, I could start my own college.    </p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa.    </p>
<p>We can't talk business in here.    </p>
<p>Just general schemes for world domination.    </p>
<p>Fraternal handshake?    </p>
<p>Oh, all right.    </p>
<p>You are on my radar.    </p>
<p>(slurping)    </p>
<p>(grunting)    </p>
<p>(crackling)    </p>
<p>What you doing, Mr. B?    </p>
<p>I never want to see the word &quot;Yale&quot; again.    </p>
<p>We're changing all our locks to Schlage.    </p>
<p>Eh, to be honest, I'm thinking of starting my own college.    </p>
<p>You can make a big fat profit.    </p>
<p>A for-profit college?    </p>
<p>Eh, that's where I went.    </p>
<p>University of Phoenix, Oklahoma in Washington State.    </p>
<p>At least that's where it was last month.    </p>
<p>It moves around quite a bit.    </p>
<p>A for-profit college?    </p>
<p>You said that already, sir.    </p>
<p>A for-profit college?    </p>
<p>- (&quot;Pomp and Circumstance&quot; plays)<br />
- Excellent.    </p>
<p>Kudos.    </p>
<p>(chuckles)    </p>
<p>And now for your first economics lesson.    </p>
<p>So long, suckers!    </p>
<p>(screaming)    </p>
<p>Boola Boola?    </p>
<p>(sinister chuckle) Moola moola.    </p>
<p>♪    </p>
<p>and you can't make it without a college degree.    </p>
<p>But for some reason    </p>
<p><em>worthy students don't always get in.</em>    </p>
<p>Students these days don't have four years to waste at a fully-accredited institution.    </p>
<p><em>Burns University will grab you by the pants</em>    </p>
<p><em>and fling you into the job of your dreams.</em>    </p>
<p>Elder care associate.    </p>

<p>Museum manager, nighttime.    </p>
<p>(boing noise)    </p>
<p>TV re-capper.    </p>
<p>(boing noise)    </p>
<p>BURNS: <em>Burns University gives you a degree</em> you can print on your computer.    </p>
<p><em>Out of the sight of the law.</em>    </p>
<p>I'm proud to be the first in my family    </p>
<p>to earn non-transferable credits.    </p>
<p>I've made a billion dollars through ruthless backstabbing.    </p>
<p>But now, for no apparent reason, I seem to be helping young people.    </p>
<p>So start your future today.    </p>
<p>Because at Burns University...    </p>
<p>ALL: Your life gets the full Monty!    </p>
<p>(chuckles) What are you laughing at?    </p>
<p>Does &quot;the Full Monty&quot; have some sort of naughty double meaning?    </p>
<p>♪ I believe in miracles ♪    </p>
<p>♪ Where you from ♪    </p>
<p>♪ You sexy thing... ♪    </p>
<p>If only our faculty could be hired so easily.    </p>
<p>Oh, but we already have a faculty: them!    </p>
<p>Sir, these people can barely run the plant, much less teach on the side.    </p>
<p>Smithers, when you think of teachers, what do you think of?    </p>
<p>Low-paid workforce with no healthcare in a toxic environment.    </p>
<p>And there you have them.    </p>
<p>Just pull them off one-by-one till the power stops.    </p>
<p>We'll be fine.    </p>
<p>(Marge humming)    </p>
<p>What are you teaching, Dad?    </p>
<p>I'm giving lectures on what I do at work.    </p>
<p>Well, what do you do at work?    </p>
<p>Well, I... you know, the button stuff.    </p>
<p>Have you prepared a reading list?    </p>
<p>I have to read?    </p>
<p>- No, it's for them.<br />
- Whoo-hoo!    </p>
<p>(groans)    </p>
<p>But what are you actually gonna say to them?    </p>
<p>I'll start with the life cycle of the atom.    </p>
<p>A baby atom is called a &quot;neutron,&quot; when it turns professional, it becomes a proton.    </p>
<p>And if it runs for office, it's an electron.    </p>
<p>(Lisa gulping, sighs)    </p>
<p>Lisa, did you just drink that?    </p>
<p>(slurred): How'd you guess?    </p>
<p>No, &quot;sheriously.&quot; Oh, wow.    </p>
<p>Wow, my first slurred word.    </p>
<p>Dad, a college education is important.    </p>
<p>It's my only hope for getting me out of this... pardon me, Mom... dump.    </p>
<p>Lisa, go to bed right now.    </p>
<p>- Oh, keep your pants on, lady. Dad!<br />
- (gasps)    </p>
<p>Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad!    </p>
<p>I believe in higher education.    </p>
<p>You are a teacher.    </p>
<p>If you make a joke out of it,    </p>
<p>(voice breaking): you are crushing my only hope.    </p>
<p>(sobbing)    </p>
<p>As the good kid here, I have to point out she's acting very badly.    </p>
<p>For shame.    </p>
<p>Lisa, sweetie, my professor money's going into your college fund.    </p>
<p>Ooh, that's good, I guess.    </p>
<p>How much is in it now?    </p>
<p>Depends on what we do with Grampa after he dies.    </p>
<p>Just burn me!    </p>
<p>Ooh, well, that's the most expensive option I'm considering.    </p>
<p>BURNS: Welcome to Burns University.    </p>
<p>Don't park at Del Taco.    </p>
<p>Our motto: <em>Ut uberiores divites.</em>    </p>
<p>Well, doesn't that mean &quot;The rich get richer&quot;?    </p>
<p>Ooh, this prestigious school doesn't need Latin-translating troublemakers.    </p>
<p>You're expelled!    </p>
<p>(dog barking)    </p>
<p>When do I throw this in the air?    </p>
<p>You're a professor, so you don't throw it.    </p>
<p>In fact, you hardly ever wear it.    </p>
<p>Geez, I had this custom-made.    </p>
<p>Apartheid's over, Lenny.    </p>
<p>It worked!    </p>
<p>Mm-hmm.    </p>
<p>Man, copying is so hard.    </p>
<p>Any questions?    </p>
<p>Yes. What does it mean?    </p>
<p>Uh, what do <em>you</em> think it means?    </p>
<p>Remember, there are no wrong answers.    </p>
<p>Well, I would guess that, uh, three neutrons coming out when only one went in,    </p>
<p>uh, leads to some kind of chain reaction.    </p>
<p>Wrong. There's always a class clown.    </p>
<p>Ten-minute coffee break.    </p>
<p>Um, any of you homies want to sell Schedule I narcotics to a fellow teenager?    </p>
<p>You're a teenager?    </p>
<p>What year were you born?    </p>
<p>Hey, you're not the cop around here. I am!    </p>
<p>- (groans)<br />
- What?    </p>
<p>Oh, right, my cover.    </p>
<p>Seriously, people.    </p>
<p>Some of us are here to learn.    </p>
<p>Professor, half-life of radium, if you please.    </p>
<p>Don't look at book!    </p>
<p>Ugh. You're crushing me.    </p>
<p>What the hell is that?    </p>
<p>Guys. You know what?    </p>
<p>It's a beautiful day.    </p>
<p>Why don't we have class outside?    </p>
<p>Yes, that's it. Go on outside.    </p>
<p>I'm totally unqualified. I don't even know how to get outside from here.    </p>
<p>That's the answer!    </p>
<p>Oh, wait.    </p>
<p>Hey, what's the matter, Professor?    </p>
<p>He don't know what to teach his class.    </p>
<p>Homer's just not cut out to be a pedagogue.    </p>
<p>That's easy. You just got to register.    </p>
<p>Stay away from playgrounds.    </p>
<p>Oh, you said &quot;pedagogue.&quot;    </p>
<p>(sighs) So this is what it's like to fail at something.    </p>
<p>LISA: I can help you, Dad.    </p>
<p>Aw, if it isn't Daddy's little wino.    </p>
<p>No, I'm clean. One day clean.    </p>
<p>Yeah, I know that tune.    </p>
<p>Just come with me.    </p>
<p>You don't have time to learn anything, but at least you can have a sense of mission.    </p>
<p>I got these for you.    </p>
<p><em>Dead Poets Society, Stand and Deliver.</em>    </p>

<p>I always cry at the end of <em>Goodbye, Mr. Chips.</em>    </p>
<p>Mr. Chips is my name for my Fritos.    </p>
<p>Just watch the movies.    </p>
<p>ROBIN WILLIAMS (over TV): Words and ideas can change the world.    </p>
<p>Oh, look at the world!    </p>
<p>It just did a boom-boom in its pants.    </p>
<p>You, you change it.    </p>
<p>Go to the woodshop and make yourself a push broom.    </p>
<p>You're gonna need it.    </p>
<p>It's not a tumor.    </p>
<p>Oh, they were great. They inspired me.    </p>
<p>And the best part is where they show the real guy over the credits.    </p>
<p>He looks just like the actor but fatter.    </p>
<p>- (snoring)<br />
- (door slams)    </p>
<p>Okay, listen up.    </p>
<p>All it takes to be a great teacher is to care.    </p>
<p>And I care.    </p>
<p>So I'm a great teacher.    </p>
<p>I don't like you, and you don't like me, but I'm your only ticket out of the barrio.    </p>
<p>¿Comprende, ése?    </p>
<p>I understand. I understand plenty.    </p>
<p>Do you know you can get a hot shower by hooking up your hose to your car radiator?    </p>
<p>Towel off with the floor mat and feel like a king.    </p>
<p>♪ Ah, cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha. ♪    </p>
<p>Good. Now he can bring the rest of the Latin Kings in line.    </p>
<p>Okay, first lesson.    </p>
<p>(whistle blows)    </p>
<p>(Lenny shouts)    </p>
<p>Always watch out for a little rod falling into the back of your shirt.    </p>
<p>I do it, like, every week.    </p>
<p>Now remember, your chair has three levers: down, back and lock.    </p>
<p>Down, back and lock.    </p>
<p>- Together.<br />
- ALL: Down, back and lock!    </p>
<p>Down, back and lock!    </p>

<p>Down, back and lock!    </p>
<p>Carpe diem!    </p>
<p>So, Andre, is it true?    </p>
<p>You're dropping out of my class?    </p>
<p>May I ask why?    </p>
<p>I... well, I...    </p>
<p>I-I want to go back to counseling at-risk teens.    </p>
<p>No, Andre. You don't get to throw your life away.    </p>
<p>I'll be here for every class.    </p>
<p>Carpe diem.    </p>
<p>Carpe diem.    </p>
<p>Just what does that mean, by the way?    </p>
<p>Fish for a dime, my friend.    </p>
<p>Fish for a dime.    </p>
<p>(mechanical whirring)    </p>
<p>How much are we charging for hugs, Smithers?    </p>
<p>Five dollars. But, uh, I'll give you one for free.    </p>
<p>Quiet.    </p>
<p>Monty, I want to buy the whole school.    </p>
<p>But it must include Homer Simpson.    </p>
<p>He is a great teacher.    </p>
<p>But first I must find out how much he's worth to the plant.    </p>
<p>(whispers indistinctly)    </p>
<p>I see. It seems I owe you a hundred thousand dollars.    </p>
<p>Great lecture, Professor S.    </p>
<p>I finally understand how gamma rays turned Bruce Banner into the Hulk.    </p>
<p>Always remember the equation, &quot;gamma equals green.&quot;    </p>
<p>Man, I wish you were my father, Dad.    </p>
<p>Uh, Simpson, I've sold your contract.    </p>
<p>No! You cannot stop me from teaching.    </p>
<p>I was going to paint houses in the summer.    </p>
<p>Nothing will stop the greatest teacher in the world from painting houses!    </p>
<p>Oh, calm down. You'll be working for this man at his private estate.    </p>
<p>What? Me?    </p>
<p>Alone? Without my kids?    </p>
<p>Yes.    </p>
<p>Sounds good. Who are you?    </p>
<p>The owner of more for-profit colleges than anyone in the world.    </p>
<p>But these students are going to miss you.    </p>
<p>Thank you!    </p>
<p>I just want to say, each and every one of you gets an incomplete!    </p>
<p>I can't hear him. Can you?    </p>
<p>Nope.    </p>
<p>Love was the test.    </p>
<p>And you all passed.    </p>
<p>(screeches)    </p>
<p>PILOT: Uh, folks, we'll be landing at Mr. Verlander's secret estate shortly.    </p>
<p>A flight attendant will be coming by to put a blindfold over your eyes.    </p>
<p>Cabin crew, please wipe your memory and prepare for landing.    </p>
<p>Which way do I go?    </p>
<p>Uh, use the map!    </p>
<p>D'oh!    </p>
<p>Homer Simpson.    </p>
<p>AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE: Voice does not match file from     .    </p>
<p>(Walter Matthau voice): Let's go out for frosty chocolate milkshakes.    </p>
<p>Welcome, Homer Simpson.    </p>
<p>Whoa.    </p>
<p>Hmm.    </p>
<p>Hmm? You unload your own dishwasher?    </p>
<p>Yeah. If you don't, you get a, a funny smell.    </p>
<p>Now, come in.    </p>
<p>Are you tired from your trip?    </p>
<p>Let's get you a refreshing cryofreeze.    </p>
<p>Rejuvenating, huh?    </p>
<p>It opens your pores.    </p>
<p>Uh, what happens if I pee in this?    </p>
<p>Are you just asking?    </p>
<p>Or did you already pee in it?    </p>
<p>I'm asking for a friend.    </p>
<p>So what's our next activity?    </p>
<p>I hope it's not square dancing.    </p>
<p>I'd like you to meet the rest of my guests.    </p>
<p>Hmm.    </p>
<p>Homer, say hello to the greatest educators in the world.    </p>
<p>Neil deGrasse Tyson, astrophysicist.    </p>
<p>The Solar System is over four and a half billion years old.    </p>
<p><em>Jeopardy!</em> champion of champions, Ken Jennings.    </p>
<p>Who is &quot;glad to meet you&quot;?    </p>
<p>Financial educator Suze Orman.    </p>
<p>You are not allowed to buy a Mercedes until you pay off your credit cards.    </p>
<p>Great, now you tell me.    </p>
<p>Screenwriting guru Robert McKee.    </p>
<p>Welcome to the act three climax,    </p>
<p>resolution of story and subplots.    </p>
<p>I expect you're wondering why I've assembled a team of the world's greatest teachers.    </p>
<p>To teach something.    </p>
<p>To somebody.    </p>
<p>Well, there are only six basic plots.    </p>
<p>Rise-fall, fall-rise, steady fall, steady rise, black cop-white cop, and stop that wedding.    </p>
<p>Well, here's what I'm up to.    </p>
<p>This is Sallie.    </p>
<p>And these are Sallie.    </p>
<p>And those are Sallie!    </p>
<p>And those... are Sullys.    </p>
<p>Robot replicas of the greatest pilot of all time.    </p>
<p>He lost all their bags.    </p>
<p>No one talks about that.    </p>
<p>You are the greatest living educators, of humans.    </p>
<p>But now you must face the greatest challenge of your lives:    </p>
<p>Can you teach an artificial intelligence?    </p>
<p>To teach a robot.    </p>
<p>Now you've compounded my interest.    </p>
<p>That was a very useful time cut.    </p>
<p>Now, let's find out what's going on.    </p>
<p>Leave that to me, Robert.    </p>
<p>What's going on?    </p>
<p>I'll tell you, and I won't k*ll you afterwards.    </p>
<p>What? This is a student loan application.    </p>
<p>Mm. Sallie...    </p>
<p>Sallie Mae?    </p>
<p>The Federal Student Loan Program?    </p>
<p>You're creating an army of robots so advanced that they can get student loans.    </p>
<p>That's right. These stu-bots... or ro-dents, if you prefer... will attend the universities I've been buying up    </p>
<p>and funnel billions of taxpayer dollars to me.    </p>
<p>That's it. As Americans, it's our duty to either    </p>
<p>stop evil billionaires or elect them to the highest office.    </p>
<p>Well, we've done it. You're all up to your polyurethane necks in debt and heading to Yale.    </p>
<p>Follow me.    </p>
<p>SALLIES: Boola Boola.    </p>
<p>Boola Boola.    </p>
<p>Good luck, Homer.    </p>
<p>Will I see you at the last minute saving the day?    </p>
<p>Nah, too clichéd.    </p>
<p>The Sallies have blended right in.    </p>
<p>We've got    productions of <em>The Crucible</em> going on,    </p>
<p>and the deepest Division III women's lacrosse team the world has ever seen.    </p>
<p>(Homer murmuring)    </p>
<p>They're perfect students in every way.    </p>
<p>And that's their weakness.    </p>
<p>Bleep, blop, bloop.    </p>
<p>Bleep, bloop, blorp.    </p>
<p>I am a robot, too.    </p>
<p>My father was a toaster.    </p>
<p>He's in botface.    </p>
<p>That's unbelievably offensive.    </p>
<p>Microaggression.    </p>
<p>Cultural appropriation.    </p>
<p>- Offensive.<br />
- Offensive.    </p>
<p>ALL: Offensive.    </p>
<p>Dear Lord, those teachers made them too human.    </p>
<p>You've ruined me.    </p>
<p>Well, not completely.    </p>
<p>I still have my health.    </p>
<p>So, how much will it cost if my daughter applies in ten years?    </p>
<p>$ ,   .    </p>
<p>That's not so bad.    </p>
<p>- That's the application fee.<br />
- Oh, yeah.    </p>
<p>Lisa, do you see the rings of Saturn?    </p>
<p>I do.    </p>
<p>The question is, what is five-sixths?    </p>
<p>Marge, listen to me.    </p>
<p>You can't fix stupid.    </p>
<p>You have to k*ll him for the insurance.    </p>
<p>I've always said these tags are pointless.    </p>
<p>Story's over. Good night.    </p>
<p>♪ To the tables down at Mory's ♪    </p>
<p>♪ To the place where Louie dwells ♪    </p>
<p>♪ To the dear old Temple Bar ♪    </p>

<p>♪ Sing the Whiffenpoofs assembled ♪    </p>
