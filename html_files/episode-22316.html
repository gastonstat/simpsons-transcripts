							<p>D'oh.</p>
<p>How will the springfielder of the future get around town?</p>
<p>Will he be like bus-stop Bill, caught out in the rain?</p>
<p>Or will he be like subway Sam, packed like a tuna on the Springfield metro line?</p>
<p>Here he can rub shoulders with fellow businessmen and share their deadly germs.</p>
<p>These two men might as well be kissing.</p>
<p>Is there no way to get to work in comfort, safety and style?</p>
<p>Well, it looks like Motorcar Mel's got the answer.</p>
<p>He's cruising at 130 miles an hour in a plutonium-powered auto on the spacious skyway of tomorrow.</p>
<p>And it's got plenty of room for all of Mrs. Mel's shopping.</p>
<p>All that's left is to pick Junior up from school.</p>
<p>Looks like that robot arm needs a little adjustment.</p>
<p>Well, that concludes...</p>
<p>I don't really know what that was.</p>
<p>Now please take out your homework.</p>
<p>Homework? What homework?</p>
<p>We had to build a Hopi lndian pueblo.</p>
<p>Mine features indigenous Hopi songs.</p>
<p>♪ And a hie na ho na hey. ♪</p>
<p>What's this?</p>
<p>A promoter has arrived to entice the tribe to perform in a Wild West show.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the chief doesn't read the contract very carefully.</p>
<p>The good news is, over a hundred years later, a brilliant little boy receives an &quot;A&quot; for his amazing presentation.</p>
<p>Ah...</p>
<p>Bravo, Martin. Bravo.</p>
<p>Well, let's see what the rest of you dullards have to offer.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>Okay, don't panic.</p>
<p>I can build one of those things from the crap in my desk.</p>
<p>Bart Simpson, you've had three months to do this project.</p>
<p>You started 30 seconds ago.</p>
<p>Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p>I'm not complimenting you.</p>
<p>You've destroyed every ideal I've had about teaching since I saw &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot; as a little girl.</p>
<p>Ha-ha. You're old.</p>
<p>I saw it on video in the '80s.</p>
<p>Outdated medium.</p>
<p>I stand by my ha-ha.</p>
<p>Bart, I'm sending your parents a letter.</p>
<p>&quot;Irresponsible, unprepared, bad seed...&quot;</p>
<p>Good guy.</p>
<p>&quot;Bad guy.&quot;</p>
<p>Signed... stamped and sealed.</p>
<p>So, can I deliver that to the office for you?</p>
<p>Hah. I wasn't born yesterday.</p>
<p>Hah. Tell me about it.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Martin?</p>
<p>Outgoing mail slot. Now.</p>
<p>Got to stop that letter.</p>
<p>Oh, fire alarm.</p>
<p>Ooh, that means firemen.</p>
<p>Sixth-graders? No!!!</p>
<p>I'm sure it's a training bra.</p>
<p>PG-13.</p>
<p>I have an unwanted boner.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Hoisting a bag.</p>
<p>Ay, there's no better feeling on earth.</p>
<p>Now what are you up to?</p>
<p>Whatever happened to &quot;Hi&quot;?</p>
<p>Hi. Now what are you up to?</p>
<p>A letter's coming from school, and I need to be home to keep Mom and Dad from getting it.</p>
<p>Mom. I have a fever.</p>
<p>Ooh, 103.</p>
<p>No school today.</p>
<p>Then again, there's only one way to get a truly accurate reading.</p>
<p>Bart, pants.</p>
<p>Just close your eyes and think of Milhouse.</p>
<p>Yup. 103 on the dot.</p>
<p>You're staying home.</p>
<p>How did you...? I don't want to talk about it.</p>
<p>I got to get that letter before Mom and Dad do.</p>
<p>Stay focused.</p>
<p>Focused.</p>
<p>Focused.</p>
<p>Focused.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Credit card offer, overdue bill, credit card offer, overdue bill.</p>
<p>Huh? What's this?</p>
<p>What the...?</p>
<p>You're a month behind on homework?</p>
<p>I tried really hard to stop you from finding out.</p>
<p>Does that help?</p>
<p>A little!</p>
<p>These are Bart's uncompleted homework assignments for the last month: worksheets, problem sets, book reports, math jumbles, dioramas, topic sentences, conclusions, bibliographies, synonyms, mean-the-sames, define-a-likes, word twins and one Thanksgiving hand-turkey.</p>
<p>One month?</p>
<p>That's a heavy workload for a fourth grader.</p>
<p>I say this boy needs more homework.</p>
<p>I don't have to do it with him, do I?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Pile it on.</p>
<p>I want him to be Korean by the time he's done.</p>
<p>Hmm. Clean dishes.</p>
<p>I either have to unload them, or, uh...</p>
<p>Oh. Thanks for doing the dishes.</p>
<p>No problem. You can unload.</p>
<p>You know, I think Bart might have too much homework.</p>
<p>If they keep overwhelming him, he might be turned off school forever.</p>
<p>Oh, my. A child who doesn't enjoy school?</p>
<p>Hello? Hollywood?</p>
<p>You want to buy the movie rights to this incredible story?</p>
<p>A million dollars?</p>
<p>Deal.</p>
<p>Oh, now I have to write it.</p>
<p>Digibot, Go-go-goman has the crystal life ball.</p>
<p>Wow, how does this show stay so fresh?</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>You're supposed to be doing your homework.</p>
<p>No more TV for you.</p>
<p>Until your homework is done, the only place your butt is safe from my foot is in that chair.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>It's okay, Bart.</p>
<p>Just do a couple vocabulary words, then come have some milk and cookies.</p>
<p>But Dad said I had to finish my...</p>
<p>Never mind what he said.</p>
<p>You just listen to me.</p>
<p>Hey, Lis, Mom and Dad just told me two different things.</p>
<p>How is that possible?</p>
<p>Well, sometimes people who agree on most things have one issue that they disagree strongly about.</p>
<p>In politics, it's called a wedge issue, like illegal immigration or gay marriage.</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Can I play them against each other so I don't have to do any homework at all?</p>
<p>You would mess up Mom and Dad's marriage just to get out of doing some homework?</p>
<p>Hey, hey, I would end all life on this planet just to get out of doing fractions.</p>
<p>Fractions aren't that hard.</p>
<p>You just have to find a common denominator.</p>
<p>For example, one half plus one third equals...</p>
<p>End... all... life... on... this... planet!</p>
<p>You'll need to know fractions to make that expl*si*n!</p>
<p>I don't care.</p>
<p>Oh, so much homework.</p>
<p>Childhood slipping away.</p>
<p>Bart, put down those books and go play this instant.</p>
<p>If you say so.</p>
<p>Right on time.</p>
<p>Grape soda: shaken, not stirred.</p>
<p>Let's roll.</p>
<p>Dear Lord, please give my stubborn husband the wisdom to see that I am right as usual.</p>
<p>Too late, Marge.</p>
<p>I already used a prayer block on your prayer.</p>
<p>There's no such thing as prayer blocks.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>♪ Fight, fight, fight, the Itchy and Scratchy Show. ♪</p>
<p>Hey, why aren't you doing your homework?</p>
<p>I said he could take a break.</p>
<p>The violence really relaxes me.</p>
<p>You don't get to relax till you get to the bottom of this homework stack.</p>
<p>Don't contradict me in front of our son.</p>
<p>Well, don't be wrong in front of our son.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? Well...</p>
<p>Let's have lunch at Crouching Tiger Hidden Eggroll.</p>
<p>Hmm. No line, near the men's room.</p>
<p>I see no reason to question your choice.</p>
<p>Smooth move, Mom, tricking Dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn't serve beer.</p>
<p>What the...? Then I want to eat at... Moe's Express.</p>
<p>By express, I mean that you express your anger and hatred.</p>
<p>The last time you ate there, you spent three nights in the mall jail.</p>
<p>That was last week, and you're still bringing it up.</p>
<p>Well, you always miss when you throw your underpants at the hamper.</p>
<p>Well, how could I ever hit the hamper if you don't let me practice?</p>
<p>You practiced all day on my birthday.</p>
<p>Fine. I was gonna apologize, but now I'm not going to.</p>
<p>You were never going to apologize.</p>
<p>I was, too. The words were in my brain.</p>
<p>You're wrong, and whenever you're wrong, you just spout gibberish.</p>
<p>Congratulations.</p>
<p>You're officially a sociopath.</p>
<p>Hey, at least I'm on a path.</p>

<p>I don't mind if you pee in the shower, but only if you're taking a shower.</p>
<p>No freedom.</p>
<p>I have no freedom around this house.</p>
<p>After sex, I'm not talking to you.</p>
<p>Well, then there won't be any sex.</p>
<p>You can't sex fire me, I sex quit.</p>
<p>Got to stay mad.</p>
<p>The next morning is where the fight is won or lost.</p>
<p>Freeze him out.</p>
<p>It's cold in Marge's doghouse, baby.</p>
<p>I just think when two people disagree, the big jerk ought to apologize.</p>
<p>You know, Marge, Maude and I had a fight right before she died.</p>
<p>Neddy, when you're drying your hands with our monogrammed towels, can you use the &quot;NF&quot; towel, not the &quot;MF&quot;?</p>
<p>You know, maybe I should use a towel marked &quot;BDD&quot;: big diddily deal.</p>
<p>I play that fight over in my mind a thousand times a day.</p>
<p>Must win fight. Must win fight.</p>
<p>Let me say to you all, I'm pretty sure this is not a dream.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, I k*ll her.</p>
<p>I've got to apologize.</p>
<p>Once again, sleeping at work has saved my marriage.</p>
<p>Compromise has no place in a marriage.</p>
<p>Stick to your g*n.</p>
<p>And if he leaves, you'll be free and happy, like us.</p>
<p>Yes. Happy.</p>
<p>So happy.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>I'm going to find my husband.</p>
<p>Don't depress the kids.</p>
<p>That pacifier's the last true friend you'll have.</p>
<p>Must apologize. Must apologize.</p>
<p>I'm sorry we ever fought.</p>
<p>We can't let Bart drive us apart.</p>
<p>He's the reason we had to get married.</p>
<p>Till the two of us are back on track, Bart can fend for himself.</p>
<p>Bart? Bart who?</p>
<p>I'm being cute.</p>
<p>It's working.</p>
<p>Put down some flares, boys.</p>
<p>We're gonna be here a while.</p>
<p>Awesome breakfast, Marge.</p>
<p>Breakfast in bed is so much better than breakfast in a chair.</p>
<p>Mmm. I'm gonna go paste your heads back into the family photos.</p>
<p>I've got them right here.</p>
<p>Dad, I know you're gonna say no, but Mom would say...</p>
<p>Whatever. Knock yourself out.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>You may not realize this, Bart, but your mother and I have been fighting about you a lot lately.</p>
<p>And I've realized our marriage is more important than your future.</p>
<p>From now on, you're on your own.</p>
<p>Really? Okay.</p>
<p>Uh, Marge?</p>
<p>I don't want to ruin the moment, but you got something stuck between your...</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Ah, a peaceful Saturday afternoon, with no Bart Simpson, and no Milhouse, for that matter.</p>
<p>Nothing on my agenda but to sit here and watch hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Sugar water?</p>
<p>Now, why would someone...</p>
<p>Their tiny tongues are like knives.</p>
<p>Big mistake.</p>
<p>Attacking me outside school hours and property.</p>
<p>Legally, I can spank your bare bottoms.</p>
<p>Follow me.</p>
<p>You can't hide forever, and I'm a very patient man.</p>
<p>I once waited an hour and a half for a haircut.</p>
<p>Whoa, what is this place?</p>
<p>Remember that time I was carried off by groundhogs?</p>
<p>This is where I wound up.</p>
<p>Behold, an ancient subway station.</p>
<p>I never knew Springfield had a subway.</p>
<p>It's like a Thomas the t*nk Engine we can go inside.</p>
<p>With no Sir Topham Hatt to tell us what we can and can't do.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>Which flavor do I save: the Radical Red or the Blueberry Blast?</p>
<p>Oh, curse this Squishee's choice.</p>
<p>I love watching you knit.</p>
<p>It reminds me of watching pictures download on our old dial-up modem.</p>
<p>Remember that day we brought it home, and it was all... eeee... ooo... eee... ooo.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, Homie, we're having a real conversation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Eeee.... ooo.</p>
<p>Oh, you won't believe how I got home.</p>
<p>Don't know, don't care.</p>
<p>You don't even want to know if I have anything to do with this mysterious seismic activity of late?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>I'm saving my yelling for where it does some good.</p>
<p>Lisa! You're a wonderful child!</p>
<p>Keep up the good work!</p>
<p>Thanks, Dad.</p>
<p>But you're so loud, it's hurting my ears.</p>
<p>Sorry!</p>
<p>It's weird.</p>
<p>I just made an entire town lose its lunch.</p>
<p>And?</p>
<p>And I'm not feeling the rush.</p>
<p>Tell me more.</p>
<p>Something's missing. Am I broken?</p>
<p>Jump with me.</p>
<p>Bart, at the end of the day, if your parents aren't p.o. 'd, you haven't really pranked.</p>
<p>You got to take it up a notch.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>If no one's getting mad, are you really being bad?</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>The tremors are tearing her apart.</p>
<p>One more shake, and the whole school could come down.</p>
<p>Seymour, do something.</p>
<p>Destroy the school, eh?</p>
<p>That's what I'm talkin' about.</p>
<p>Man, those textbooks really burn.</p>
<p>&quot;Mom and Dad, Bart is going to use the old subway to destroy Springfield Elementary.&quot;</p>
<p>And there's a map of the subway system attached.</p>
<p>Homer, we've got to stop him.</p>
<p>But, Marge, I thought we were chilling out for the sake of our marriage.</p>
<p>We're going to have to be good parents to our son and work twice as hard on our marriage.</p>
<p>Fine. I'll do both at once.</p>
<p>We should both take a role in vacation planning.</p>
<p>Oh, she's coming down.</p>
<p>Oh, Lord, let me finish this hallway, then you can send me to hell a happy man.</p>
<p>Bart!</p>
<p>Oh, there's a nickel.</p>
<p>Destroy. Destroy.</p>
<p>Boy, look at that ironwork.</p>
<p>Well, I'll be. There's a sofa in here.</p>
<p>It's stuck.</p>
<p>Must... squeeze... harder.</p>
<p>Nah...</p>
<p>Why you little....</p>
<p>Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p>The school is saved.</p>
<p>Unfurl the flag.</p>
<p>Mister, you are grounded.</p>
<p>And no TV.</p>
<p>And I'm taking all the exciting colors out of your crayons.</p>
<p>And when you're out of my sight, you must constantly Twitter me exactly what you are up to, even though I don't know what Twitter is and have no desire to find out.</p>
<p>Ah, you guys are the meanest parents ever.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Life stinks, huh?</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Mom said she was tipped off by a note from me.</p>
<p>But you know something?</p>
<p>I didn't write this note.</p>
<p>That's ridiculous.</p>
<p>If you didn't write it, who in the world could have?</p>
<p>You wanted to get caught.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>How can you be so sure?</p>
<p>Elementary, my dear Simpson.</p>
<p>Leave it to you to misspell a word you see first thing every morning.</p>
<p>But don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.</p>
<p>As far as Mom and Dad know, you're just a soulless little psycho.</p>
<p>Thanks, Lis.</p>
<p>Anytime.</p>
<p>So our family of the future is once again together and happy.</p>
<p>Mom brings Dad the evening paper... one of six editions printed daily.</p>
<p>Want to know what happened in China yesterday?</p>
<p>Read the paper.</p>
<p>And if Mom and Dad want a little privacy, Junior can be flash-frozen until further notice, because this is the most wonderful world of all-- the world of tomorrow.</p>
