<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>Monday morning chit-chat at the water cooler.</p>
<p>The only reason to have done stuff over the weekend.</p>
<p>The only part of the movie I didn't get is: now Radioactive Man gets his powers <em>from</em> his suit?</p>
<p>The suit is slowly k*ll him, but if he doesn't wear it, he'll die.</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>Wait, you guys saw the new Radioactive Man sequel?</p>
<p>Uh, it's not a sequel, it's a reboot.</p>
<p>Actually, this one undoes the stuff from the last one, so it's a de-boot.</p>
<p>Stop talking!</p>
<p>I haven't seen it yet!</p>
<p><em>Radioactive Man Re-Rises</em> came out three days ago.</p>
<p>It is fair game.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you haven't seen it, then you gotta leave the water cooler.</p>
<p>But what if I want some cooled water?</p>
<p>You should have thought of that when you were not seeing the movie.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>I'll drink alone.</p>
<p>(grunts)</p>
<p>♪ The Simpsons 25x09 ♪<br />
Steal This Episode<br />
Original Air Date on January 5, 2014</p>
<p>It was so awesome when Radioactive Man had to erase his own memory.</p>
<p>Yeah, so he wouldn't be tortured by his past when he was born in the future.</p>
<p>Oh, they're talking about the movie!</p>
<p>Hurry up, you idiot!</p>
<p>No, no, don't stop!</p>
<p>I'm sorry I got mad.</p>
<p>I'll do that thing you like.</p>
<p>I got Radioactive Man's new villain... the Collider.</p>
<p>I turn out to be a good guy.</p>
<p>I die, but come back to life after the credits.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Sometimes we feel there's nowhere left to turn, much like Radioactive Man, when he had to k*ll his own antimatter twin with a blast of time particles from the Chrono-cube... - ♪ Amazing grace ♪ How loud I sing ♪</p>
<p>...and in doing so, mortally wounding...</p>
<p>♪ To drown the spoilers out! ♪</p>
<p>...his girlfriend, who was pregnant with his own...</p>
<p>♪ Shut up, shut up, shut... ♪</p>
<p>(yells)</p>
<p>And stay out!</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: <em>Okay.</em></p>
<p>I gotta go see the Radioactive Man movie before it gets totally ruined for me.</p>
<p>Ooh, date night!</p>
<p>I'll go change my bra.</p>
<p>I want to see <em>Radioactive Man Re-Rises.</em></p>
<p>If Bart's going, I'm going!</p>
<p>If Grampa's going, I'm going!</p>
<p>If you all go, then I have to pay for a babysitter.</p>
<p>We'll call that nice girl who's getting her Masters in Child Development.</p>
<p>Emily-Beth?</p>
<p>We can't afford Emily-Beth!</p>
<p>She brings her own puppets!</p>
<p>(cooing)</p>
<p>Bye-bye, Maggie!</p>
<p>Bye-bye, money.</p>
<p>Two adults, two kids, and one senior with the mind of a baby so he should be free.</p>
<p>For the 3-D show, that'll be $72.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>Or, for ten dollars more, you can see it in IMAX Hobbit Frame Rate Virtual Reality Vision.</p>
<p>(moviegoers shuddering)</p>
<p>(vomits)</p>
<p>All right, movie, you better be worth it.</p>
<p>(dramatic music plays)</p>
<p>(engines revving)</p>
<p>(dancers screaming)</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: The motorcycle dudes are chicks!</p>
<p>I wonder what else is chicks?</p>
<p>(women gasping)</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>Don't ask.</p>
<p>Do smell.</p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: <em>Also available in &quot;Arctic Slut,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Morning After Melon&quot; and &quot;Elon Musk.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Hey... they tricked us!</p>
<p>That's a commercial!</p>
<p>If I wanted to pay for commercials I can't skip, I'd sign up for Hulu Plus!</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
<p><em>You're</em> shushing <em>me?</em></p>
<p>This guy's on his cell phone, she's texting, he's sexting, and that guy brought a baby to a 9:00 movie!</p>
<p>(Spanish accent): That's negative, man.</p>
<p>What happened to the movies?</p>
<p>First they got worse than TV, and now this!</p>
<p>(all gasping)</p>
<p>(yelling)</p>
<p>And stay out!</p>
<p><em>(Homer moans)</em></p>
<p>Chins up, Homer.</p>
<p>You don't need a theater to watch the movie.</p>
<p>You just have to illegally download it.</p>
<p>Illegally download it?</p>
<p>Is that legal?</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>But it sure is easy.</p>
<p>I'll walk you through it.</p>
<p>All you have to do is...</p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: <em>The FOX network forbids the broadcast of step-by-step instructions for illegally downloading copyrighted intellectual property.</p>
<p>In the meantime, please enjoy this footage from NASCAR's 2011 Martinsville Cup.</em></p>
<p>(engines roaring)</p>
<p>Wow, that was easy.</p>
<p>All I had to do was click on...</p>
<p>(engines roaring)</p>
<p>And play!</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>Bless you, boy.</p>
<p>That was the greatest thing I've seen on a computer that I can talk about with you in the room.</p>
<p>How did you know how to do that?</p>
<p>I'm under 30.</p>
<p>Guys, guys, I saw the Radioactive Man movie!</p>
<p>Here's my ten favorite scenes from worst to best.</p>
<p>Number ten: when what's-his-name did that stuff with those dudes.</p>
<p>Number nine...</p>
<p>Uh, Homer, that movie's been talked out.</p>
<p>We're discussing the new James Bond flick.</p>
<p>I like that James Bond is ugly now.</p>
<p>I like that he doesn't have any gadgets.</p>
<p>I like that he's not good at sh**ting, doesn't say funny quips, or do any James Bond stuff.</p>
<p>Shut up, shut up, shut up!</p>
<p>Homer, go to the theater and see the movie.</p>
<p>(scoffs) Theaters?</p>
<p>All I need to see this movie is a laptop and a Web site based in a country that's really just an offshore oil platform.</p>
<p>Care to join me?</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>That was so much better than the cinema.</p>
<p>It mixes the wonder of movie-going with the rush of stealing.</p>
<p>All we want is brand-new, big budget entertainment in our homes for nothin'.</p>
<p>Why doesn't Hollywood get that?</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I am inspired to create a theater for the people... an experience free of all the nuisances and gouging of modern-day moviegoing!</p>
<p>Yeah, no more jerks talking on their cell phones!</p>
<p>No more jerks telling me not to talk on my cell phone!</p>
<p>And best of all... we'll never have to sit through another annoying commercial again!</p>
<p>Welcome to &quot;Cinema Pirate-diso.&quot;</p>
<p>Tonight's movie is <em>Life is Funny,</em> directed by Judd Apatow.</p>
<p>It's based on his life, starring his family and ad-libbed by his friends.</p>
<p>So for the next three and a half hours, enjoy!</p>
<p>(frustrated groan)</p>
<p>Did you just pass gas while we were making love?</p>
<p>You're the one who hired the Korean taco truck for our private school fund-raiser.</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>I live it, he writes it.</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>Well, what did you think?</p>
<p>We may be going to Hell for seeing &quot;side bosom,&quot; but this backyard is a little slice of Heaven, all thanks to Homer Simpson!</p>
<p>(cheering)</p>
<p>This is fun!</p>
<p>And it was so nice of the movie company to let you show their film.</p>
<p>Let me?</p>
<p>Uh, sweetheart, I downloaded it off the lnternet... illegally.</p>
<p>An illegal download?</p>
<p>But Hollywood says stealing from Hollywood is wrong.</p>
<p>(scoffs) Why should a regular guy like me have to spend 15 bucks a ticket so studios can pay huge salaries to the <em>Air Buds</em> and Ray Liottas of the world?</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>When I watched that pirated movie, I was stealing with my eyes.</p>
<p>So I'm repaying the good people in Hollywood for the ticket I should have bought.</p>
<p>Now this money will end up in the hands of the talented people who make magic happen on the silver screen.</p>
<p>(inhales) Ah...</p>
<p>(startled gasp)</p>
<p>Karen, get me the FBI!</p>
<p>Karen!</p>
<p>You people joined this squad for one reason: to fight movie pirates.</p>
<p>I wanted to catch serial k*ll.</p>
<p>(mocking, whiny tone): &quot;I wanted to catch serial k*ll.&quot;</p>
<p>From now on, you will lay down your lives to protect America's chick flicks, buddy comedies and steady stream of animated misfires.</p>
<p>Sir, you have to see this.</p>
<p>&quot;Took it off the Web...</p>
<p>&quot;watched for free... never pay for a movie again&quot;?</p>
<p>Men, set your g*n on &quot;k*ll.&quot;</p>
<p>We're going after Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>I now present, direct from the computer of an angry editor at a special effects house, <em>Cosmic Wars Episode Seven.</em></p>
<p>(epic orchestral theme playing)</p>
<p>(audience cheering)</p>
<p>My childhood has been un-ruined!</p>
<p>Listen up, seat meat!</p>
<p>You are all in violation of Title 17 of the U.S. Copyright Code.</p>
<p>(all gasping)</p>
<p>Easy there, hotshot.</p>
<p>All the people are doing is watching a movie.</p>
<p>Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!</p>
<p>I'm not wearing an undershirt and my badge is poking into my skin.</p>

<p>What's going on here?</p>
<p>Is there a fondler in the neighborhood?</p>
<p>I'm here to arrest and hopefully stage the prison su1c1de of the mastermind of this operation--</p>
<p>Homer Simpson!</p>
<p>Ooh, mastermind.</p>
<p>We got our man, thanks to a tip from a heroic American snitch.</p>
<p>(gasps) One of you turned me in?</p>
<p>Who was it?</p>
<p>You!</p>
<p>Superintendent Chalmers, you never forgave me for that time we wore the same Hawaiian shirt to that luau!</p>
<p>They're gonna take Dad!</p>
<p>We gotta do something!</p>
<p>I'm on it.</p>
<p>(screams) Copyrighted material!</p>
<p>Don't look at it!</p>
<p>Someone sell me a ticket!</p>
<p>Ear plugs in!</p>
<p>Blinders on!</p>
<p>We trained for this!</p>
<p>(g*n)</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>From now on, the only place you'll be watching movies without having to buy a ticket is jail.</p>
<p>Oh... oh... (whimpers)</p>
<p>Baby, promise me you'll find out who turned me in.</p>
<p>(moans)</p>
<p>It's probably someone I would never suspect.</p>
<p>Never suspect.</p>
<p>(moans)</p>
<p>Your moans of sympathy are all I have.</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Whoever did this to me will be haunted by unbearable guilt forever!</p>
<p>Forever!</p>
<p>What are you guys in for?</p>
<p>Bank robbery.</p>
<p>Drug trafficking.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>Movie piracy.</p>
<p>(all gasp)</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>People in show business work hard to make those movies.</p>
<p>My media stocks under-performed because of people like you.</p>
<p>My brother lost his job as a grip on a movie set because of piracy.</p>
<p>He had to sell his Jet Ski.</p>
<p>A grip without a Jet Ski ain't no grip at all!</p>
<p>(yelling)</p>
<p>You're about to find out what we do to copyright infringers.</p>
<p>(yelling)</p>
<p>(tires screech)</p>
<p>(all clamoring)</p>
<p>(train horn blowing in distance)</p>
<p>Uh... huh?</p>
<p>(horn blowing)</p>
<p>Huh...? (screams)</p>
<p>(men yelling)</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>(screams)</p>
<p>Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p>It's almost like having Dad here.</p>
<p>Only with less growling when I go near his food.</p>
<p>I just want to know who dropped the dime on Dad.</p>
<p>Lousy rat.</p>
<p>Maybe the person that turned your father in thought they were doing the right thing.</p>
<p>Homer just pirated a movie.</p>
<p>But it's not the worst thing Dad ever did.</p>
<p>It's not even the worst kind of pirate Dad's ever been.</p>
<p>Lisa, tell your brother that stealing is wrong, no matter what.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>It wasn't like Dad was stealing for himself.</p>
<p>He created this wonderful experience for the whole town.</p>
<p>I just can't imagine anyone turning him in.</p>
<p>(door creaking open)</p>
<p>Dad, Dad, you're back, you're back!</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Dad, you're back! Dad!</p>
<p>Homer, what are you doing out of prison?</p>
<p>You have to go back and give yourself up.</p>
<p>I can't go back to jail!</p>
<p>There's no shampoo, just soap!</p>
<p>Wait, I know one place in Springfield that doesn't care about lnternet piracy laws.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking us in.</p>
<p>Our family always appreciates asylum.</p>
<p>This consulate is like being on Swedish soil.</p>
<p>You're as safe here as you would be in the Skatteskrapan.</p>
<p>(whistles)</p>
<p>Your country doesn't think illegally downloading movies is wrong?</p>
<p>The people of Sweden believe all movies should be shared freely.</p>
<p>How is that not stealing?</p>
<p>Bah, your Hollywood studios are the real thieves, claiming all their hit movies have lost money.</p>
<p>I spit on their bookkeeping.</p>
<p>Yeah, and why don't they make a sequel to <em>Taken</em> where <em>The Hangover</em> guys get taken and the only ones that could rescue them is <em>Fast and Furious.</em></p>
<p>Aw, man, I would love to pirate that.</p>
<p>As would the proud people of Sweden.</p>
<p>(sirens blaring)</p>
<p>(tires screeching)</p>
<p>They've found us!</p>
<p>There's only one surefire way to get fugitives out of a foreign building-- blasting death metal.</p>

<p>I'm so tired of being trapped in this embassy.</p>
<p>Consulate.</p>
<p>Consulates are regional offices, which serve the embassy in the capitol.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for sticking with me through all this.</p>
<p>You're the greatest wife in the world.</p>
<p>(moaning)</p>
<p>It was me!</p>
<p>I was the one who told the FBI.</p>
<p>You?</p>
<p>How could you?</p>
<p>You're my own flesh and bl*od.</p>
<p>I was just trying to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Who would've thought the authorities would use a confession against me?</p>
<p>Have you forgotten what you promised at our wedding?</p>
<p>To love and cherish?</p>
<p>To aid and abet?</p>
<p>I never wanted to say funny vows.</p>
<p>Well, you did!</p>
<p>And they got laughs.</p>
<p>Solid laughs!</p>
<p>I didn't mean for this to happen, but you <em>were</em> stealing.</p>
<p>All I ever had was you looking out for me.</p>
<p>I got nothing now.</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>All rise in the matter of <em>The People vs. Homer Simpson.</em></p>
<p>The people call Hollywood ultra-producer, Judd Apatow.</p>
<p>Homer Simpson is an enemy of art.</p>
<p>Art created by writers, directors, and the guy who uses a computer to erase or enhance nipples.</p>
<p>And not just the people who dream for a living, but the people who depend on us.</p>
<p>The spin class instructors, the personal rabbis, Seth Rogen.</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>(crying): It's true, I need him.</p>
<p>I saw a bootleg DVD of <em>The 40 Year Old Virgin</em> for sale at a car wash.</p>
<p>They left off my director's commentary!</p>
<p>It didn't even have a blooper reel!</p>
<p>(all groaning)</p>
<p><em>(gavel banging)</em></p>
<p>Homer Simpson, you have been found guilty of illegal reproduction and distribution of copyrighted material.</p>
<p>Before sentencing, do you have anything to say for yourself?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Homer, tell them your side of the story.</p>
<p>I know I hurt you, but please trust me now.</p>
<p>It'll work.</p>
<p>You know what, Judge Apatow?</p>
<p>I do have something to say.</p>
<p>These movie people may say I'm a pirate, but I'm just a man.</p>
<p>A man who loved Hollywood too much.</p>
<p>So I made my own rules and fought the big guys who tried to destroy my way of life.</p>
<p>He doesn't sound like a villain.</p>
<p>He sounds like a classic underdog.</p>
<p>He's the unlikeliest of heroes!</p>
<p>But where's the love story?</p>
<p>At first my wife didn't believe in me.</p>
<p>Maybe we forgot why we fell in love in the first place.</p>
<p>But when times seemed darkest, one minute ago, she was there and gave me the strength and courage to fight for what I believe in.</p>
<p>He's a downloading David versus a greedy Goliath.</p>
<p>An Erin Brockovich but with more cleavage!</p>
<p>Two, three... Good Lord, he's hitting all four quadrants!</p>
<p>One family, against all odds, took on the system... and lost.</p>
<p>(clamoring)</p>
<p>Mr. Simpson, I'd like to buy the rights to make a movie based on your true story.</p>
<p>I'm attached as executive producer!</p>
<p>Attached! Attached!</p>
<p>One movie?</p>
<p>We envision a trilogy.</p>
<p>Will Smith's family wants to play your family.</p>
<p>I'd be Jaden.</p>
<p>(all clamoring)</p>
<p>On behalf of Hollywood, we are dropping all charges.</p>
<p>These people hate my dad.</p>
<p>How can they want to make a movie about him?</p>
<p>Hollywood may be run by big corporations trying to squash people, but they make movies about people standing up to big corporations trying to squash them and winning.</p>
<p>I'll sign with whoever can convince Channing Tatum to gain the most weight to play me.</p>
<p>Surprise! - Surprise!</p>
<p>Surprise!</p>
<p>What the hell is all this?</p>
<p>We're so excited about your movie that we're having a special screening.</p>
<p>But the movie isn't in theaters till next week.</p>
<p>Yeah, we ripped a version off Bootleg Bay just like you taught us.</p>
<p>It's still got timecode on it, but, otherwise, it's a clean copy.</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>You're pirating my movie?</p>
<p>The hell you are!</p>
<p>Piracy is stealing!</p>
<p>You're taking money out of my family's mouths!</p>
<p>(gasping)</p>
<p>But the movie is... i-it's about you pirating movies.</p>
<p>Oh, that's Hollywood fantasy.</p>
<p>We live in the real world, where I have something called... prof-it par-tic-i-PA-tion.</p>
<p>That's negative, man.</p>
<p>Oh, Homie...</p>
<p>Now all of you go see my movie in the theater the day it opens!</p>
<p>No bargain matinees!</p>
<p>And tell your friends it was great!</p>
<p>Buy the stuff they advertise in the commercials before it!</p>
<p>Homer in the movie wears Ask Body Spray and so should you!</p>
<p>Don't ask! Do smell!</p>
<p>Homie, do you really think you should be...</p>
<p>Up-bup-bup-bup-bup!</p>
<p>What have we learned about not blindly supporting our husband?</p>
<p>Ask Body Spray!</p>
<p>But then when times seemed darkest, she was there; she gave me the strength and courage to fight for what I believe in.</p>
<p>On behalf of Hollywood, we're dropping all charges!</p>
<p>(cheering)</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>So what do you think, Lise?</p>
<p>Who are the good guys here, the media companies or the lnternet freedom guys?</p>
<p>Well, both groups claim their intentions are noble, but at the end of the day, they're both trying to steal as much money as they can.</p>
<p>So... everyone's a pirate?</p>
<p>And the worst one of all is...</p>
<p>(Seth Rogen laughing)</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
