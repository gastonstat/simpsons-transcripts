<p>D'oh! [ Screams ]</p>
<p>Well, sir, it has been an uneventful week in Badger Falls... where the women are robust, the men are pink-cheeked... and the children are pink-cheeked and robust.</p>
<p>[ Laughing ]</p>
<p>What the hell's so funny?</p>
<p>[ Inhales ] At the Apple Biscuit Café... where the smiles are free, don't you know...</p>
<p>Sven lnqvist studied the menu.</p>
<p>Finally, he ordered the same thing he has every day.</p>
<p>[ Laughter]</p>
<p>Maybe it's the TV.</p>
<p>Stupid TV. Be more funny! [ Grunts ]</p>
<p>Well, sir, I think it is time to turn this pledge drive... over to Troy McClure.</p>
<p>I can't keep up this pace forever.</p>
<p>[ Deep Sigh ]</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You might remember me from such telethons as...</p>

<p>I'm really, really, really sorry.</p>
<p>I'm afraid sorry doesn't cut it with this pope.</p>

<p>Marge Simpson.</p>
<p>[ Screams ]</p>
<p>I'd like to pledge $30. Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>Marge, it's public TV. They never have anything good.</p>
<p>Where are the Geraldos? Where are the Eubankses-ses?</p>
<p>They need our support. Besides, they gave me two tickets to the ballet.</p>
<p>The ballet? Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p>You like ballet?</p>
<p>Marjorie, please. I enjoy all the meats of our cultural stew.</p>

<p>Homer?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>[ Whirring ]</p>
<p>That's one right there.</p>
<p>All right. But, remember, it's mine.</p>
<p>That's what ballet is? [ Groans ]</p>
<p>You promised. You can't back out like when you volunteered... for that army experiment to avoid dinner at my sisters'.</p>
<p>Mr. Simpson, you do realize this may result in... hair loss, giddiness and the loss of equilibrium?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just give me the serum.</p>
<p>[ Chuckles ] It was worth it.</p>

<p>Hey, Homer, you wanna get a beer on the way home?</p>
<p>I can't.</p>
<p>I gotta take my wife to the ballet.</p>
<p>[ Chuckles ] Gonna go see the bear in the little car, huh?</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Mmm, invisible cola.</p>
<p>Mmm. [ Short Laugh ] Time to stick it to the man.</p>

<p>[ Both Yelling ]</p>
<p>[ Grunting ]</p>
<p>[ Grunts ] Must... get... to ballet.</p>
<p>Promised Marge. [ Grunts ]</p>
<p>Hello? Can I get some help?</p>

<p>[ Grunting ]</p>
<p>Mmm. Candy.</p>
<p>[ Rings ]</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Marge, this may be hard to believe... but I'm trapped inside two vending machines.</p>
<p>[ Loud Sigh ] Sure, Homer.</p>
<p>Trapped in vending machines. Okay.</p>
<p>Would you two like to go to the ballet?</p>
<p>[ Snorts ] That's girl stuff.</p>
<p>[ Doorbell Rings ]</p>
<p>Thanks, Marge. When my husband left, he took all our power tools... along with the car, my youth, my faith in mankind.</p>
<p>Well, see ya.</p>

<p>[ Laughs, Stops ] Oh, you were serious.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm going to have these things on my arms forever.</p>

<p>Mmm, convenient.</p>
<p>Homer, this-this is never easy to say.</p>
<p>I'm gonna have to saw your arms off.</p>
<p>They'll grow back, right?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Whew.</p>
<p>[ Whirring ]</p>
<p>Homer, are you just holding on to the can?</p>
<p>Your point being?</p>
<p>[ Men Laughing ]</p>
<p>I envy you and Homer.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>If you ever met my ex-husband, you'd understand.</p>
<p>All he ever did was eat, sleep and drink beer.</p>
<p>Your point being?</p>
<p>And to top it off, he's been stiffing me... on child support for the last four months.</p>
<p>[ Groans ] Well, you were unlucky.</p>
<p>But there are a lot of good men out there.</p>
<p>Hey, can I throw up in your bathroom?</p>
<p>I'll buy something.</p>
<p>[ Shudders ]</p>
<p>Marge, I know you didn't believe me about the vending machines.</p>
<p>That's why I had the firemen write me a note.</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs. Simpson: While we were rescuing your husband, a lumberyard b*rned down.&quot;</p>
<p>D'oh! Lumber has a million uses.</p>
<p>I'm disappointed in you, but it turns out...</p>
<p>I had a wonderful time with Ruth Powers.</p>
<p>In fact, we're going out again tomorrow night.</p>
<p>Marge, that's twice. I think you're spending entirely too much time with this woman.</p>
<p>Homer, please. You know it's hard for me to make friends.</p>
<p>[ Laughs ] Oh, Marge, we should do this every Thursday.</p>
<p>Marge, I got sprayed by this skunk.</p>
<p>[ Hissing ]</p>
<p>Oh, look. It's doing it again.</p>
<p>[ All Screaming ]</p>
<p>Marge, you can't go out on Saturday. That's our special night.</p>
<p>What's so special about it?</p>
<p>What's so-- Oh, I don't know.</p>
<p>A little show called Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman?</p>
<p>[ Groans ]</p>
<p>Where're you going?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>When will you be home?</p>
<p>I'm not sure.</p>
<p>Where're you going?</p>
<p>You already asked me that.</p>
<p>Will you bring me back something?</p>
<p>[ Horn Honks ]</p>
<p>Don't wait up.</p>

<p>I can't believe your mother went out to have fun without me.</p>
<p>Don't worry. You'll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers... and give you a makeover, Homina.</p>
<p>[ High-pitched Voice ] Oh, that would be delight-- [ Normal Voice ] Quiet, boy.</p>
<p>There's nothing to feel ashamed of here. Women have a right to a night out. Right, Lisa?</p>
<p>Sure, Dad. [ Imitates Whip Cracking ]</p>
<p>That's it! I'm calling my buddies.</p>
<p>Marge is not the only one who can have a girls' night out.</p>

<p>Shave up not down, you idiot.</p>
<p>Ooh, sounds delish. Let me just toss some jeans on and--</p>

<p>Fine. I can have a great time all by myself.</p>
<p>Hey, Dad, I think state and federal laws require us to have a babysitter.</p>
<p>Oh, Lisa. Haven't you seen Home Alone?</p>
<p>If some burglars come, it'll be a very humorous and entertaining situation.</p>
<p>You're absolutely right, Homer. We don't need a babysitter.</p>
<p>Wait a second. Mmm.</p>
<p>You kids do need a babysitter.</p>
<p>Blast that infernal card. Don't give that card to me.</p>
<p>Here you go-- No!</p>
<p>[ Doorbell Rings ]</p>
<p>Mr. Simpson, I was just going through your garbage... and I couldn't help overhearing that you need a babysitter.</p>
<p>Of course, being a highly k*ll attorney... my fee is $1 7 5 an hour.</p>
<p>We pay eight dollars for the night... and you can take two Popsicles out of the freezer.</p>

<p>Once we lose the cops, I'll let you out.</p>
<p>Well, I don't think they're gonna be that easy to lose.</p>
<p>These are professional lawmen and--</p>
<p>Oh, my God! It just disappeared. It's a ghost car!</p>
<p>[ Tires Screech ]</p>
<p>[ Grunts ]</p>
<p>There are ghost cars all over these highways, you know.</p>
<p>Hold me.</p>
<p>Only if you hold me.</p>
<p>[ Coyote Howling ]</p>
<p>[ Shivering ]</p>
<p>You can call a cab in there.</p>
<p>Well, bye.</p>
<p>I'm sorry about all this.</p>
<p>But you gotta admit, we did have some fun.</p>
<p>Yeah. Everything before the high-speed chase was just lovely.</p>
<p>Hey. You're a good friend, Marge.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>[ Coin Clatters ]</p>
<p>This cross-country flight from the law would be hell if we didn't stick together.</p>
<p>Hey. Friends stick together.</p>
<p>It's amazing how through all this adversity, we managed to stick together.</p>
<p>If there's one thing decent folk do, it's stick together.</p>
<p>I hate it when the waffles stick together.</p>
<p>Sticking together is what good waffles do.</p>
<p>[ Groans ]</p>
<p>[ Siren Approaching ]</p>
<p>Thanks, kid.</p>
<p>Marge, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Ruth, I've done a lot of thinking, and I really consider you a friend.</p>
<p>And an important part of friendship is--</p>
<p>[ Tires Screech ]</p>
<p>[ Marge Screams ]</p>
<p>[ Siren Blaring ]</p>
<p>You stupid kid!</p>
<p>You know that drives away all my business.</p>
<p>See you tomorrow, loser.</p>
<p>Mmm, engine-block eggs.</p>
<p>If we can keep these down, we'll be sitting pretty.</p>
<p>That's them!</p>
<p>Quiet. I can't hear the eggs.</p>
<p>[ Snoring ]</p>
<p>[ Grunts ]</p>
<p>Hey, it's morning, and Mom and Dad aren't home yet.</p>
<p>Don't worry. Mr. Hutz is still here to take care of us.</p>
<p>Don't touch my stuff!.</p>
<p>Hey. This isn't the Y.M.C.A.</p>
<p>Dispatch, this is Chief Wiggum back in pursuit of the rebelling women.</p>
<p>[ Man On Radio ] All right. Your current location?</p>
<p>Oh. Uh, I'm a--</p>
<p>I'm on a road. Looks to be asphalt.</p>
<p>Um, aw, geez. Trees, shrubs.</p>
<p>I'm directly under the Earth's sun... now.</p>
<p>[ Man On TV] We now interrupt this program for a special bulletin.</p>
<p>We've just received word of a high-speed desert chase.</p>
<p>The suspects have been identified as Ruth Powers and Marge Simpson of Springfield.</p>
<p>[ Gasps ]</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>I always knew someday Mom would violently rise up... and cast off the shackles of our male oppressors.</p>
<p>Aw, shut your yap.</p>
<p>At the risk of editorializing, these women are guilty... and must be dealt with in a harsh and brutal fashion.</p>
<p>Otherwise, their behavior could incite other women... leading to anarchy of biblical proportions.</p>
<p>It's in Revelations, people!</p>
<p>Look. We're only two miles from the state line.</p>
<p>We're gonna make it. We're gonna be okay.</p>
<p>My God! That must be every policeman in Springfield.</p>
<p>That's it. I give up.</p>
<p>A single mother can't win in a man's world.</p>
<p>Ruth, that's a lot of hooey.</p>
<p>It's not over until it's over.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I should've asked first.</p>
<p>No, Marge. You did it. We really are gonna make it now.</p>
<p>Oh, no! They're headed right for the Grand Chasm.</p>
<p>Oh, my God! They're gonna drive right into it just to teach us men a lesson.</p>
<p>And it's all my fault!</p>
<p>Marge. Marge!</p>
<p>Homer?</p>
<p>Look, Marge. I'm sorry I haven't been a better husband.</p>
<p>I'm sorry about the time I tried to make gravy in the bathtub.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I used your wedding dress to wax the car.</p>
<p>I'm sorry-- Oh, well, let's just say I'm sorry for the whole marriage up to this point.</p>
<p>You're right. I am lucky to have him.</p>
<p>But, please, Marge, don't drive into that chasm!</p>
<p>[ Together] Chasm?</p>
<p>[ Homer And Chief Wiggum Screaming ]</p>
<p>[ Thud ]</p>
<p>Ha! And to think those idiot environmentalists were protesting this landfill.</p>
<p>Solid waste. I could kiss you.</p>
<p>[ Loud Kiss ] Yech.</p>
<p>[ Kiss ] Ew.</p>
<p>[ Kiss ] Ugh.</p>
<p>[ Kiss ] Ooh, I think this was pizza.</p>
<p>[ Man ] Ruth Powers was tried in Springfield Superior Court.</p>
<p>Thejudge dismissed her ex-husband's auto theft charges... and forced him to pay all back child support.</p>
<p>Mr. Powers blamed the outcome on his lawyer, one Lionel Hutz.</p>
<p>Lionel Hutz, a.k.a. Miguel Sanchez, a.k.a. Dr. Nguyen Van Thoc... was paid eight dollars for his 3 2 hours ofbabysitting.</p>
<p>He was glad to get it.</p>
<p>Marge Simpson was charged with a violation of penal code Section 6 I 8A... wanton destruction of precious antique cans.</p>
<p>She was ordered to pay 50 cents to replace the cans... and $2,000 in punitive damages and mental anguish.</p>
<p>Homer Simpson was remanded to the custody of the United States Army... neurochemical research center at Fort Meade, Maryland for extensive testing.</p>
<p>Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p>[ People Chattering ]</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
