<p>(ALL GASP)    </p>
<p>Oh, God, it's too late.    </p>
<p>Dr. Wolff?    </p>
<p>Look, I need to tell you this one thing.    </p>
<p>Something I saw in your dog's eyes.    </p>
<p>He's at breaking point, and unless he has some kind of catharsis, something terrible could happen.    </p>
<p>He bit my mom.    </p>
<p>It is gratifying to be right.    </p>
<p>Oh, how awful.    </p>
<p>Animal control is coming to get him right now.    </p>
<p>You can't stop them.<br />
They got sticks with wire loops.    </p>
<p>Kids, pack his things.    </p>
<p>And I'll need this.<br />
This dog is coming with me.    </p>
<p>Well, I am not leaving here empty-handed.    </p>
<p>- Make me a sandwich.<br />
- No.    </p>
<p>Okay, all right.    </p>
<p>Being a police chief really sucks.    </p>
<p>- Here you go.<br />
- (SNIFFLES)    </p>
<p>(MOANS)    </p>
<p>Listen, I packed you some biscuits.    </p>
<p>And even though I deplore the k*ll of all animals, when you come to the salami, it's from me.    </p>
<p>(MOANS) Now who will chase squirrels with me?    </p>
<p>(WHINES)    </p>
<p>(SIREN WAILING)    </p>
<p>(GROANS) You better get going.    </p>
<p>Wait. I'm not an emotional guy, but...    </p>
<p>Mwah.    </p>
<p>(CHUCKLES) Get a doghouse, you two.    </p>
<p>(DOGS BARKING)    </p>
<p>Here. Have some Snausage water as you watch this video.    </p>
<p>NARRATOR: Here at the Institute, there are no bad dogs.    </p>
<p>In answer to the age-old question,    </p>
<p>&quot;Who's a good dog?&quot; You are. You are.    </p>
<p>Relax in our pile of wet dead leaves or enjoy fine dining at The Dropped Porkchop.    </p>
<p>And here's our guarantee to you: no fireworks.    </p>
<p>We'll have you feeling better in no time.    </p>
<p>Well, uh, there's nothing physically wrong with you, but to establish trust, I'll sleep in your den tonight.    </p>
<p>Well, a little bit of, uh, reading before bed? (CHUCKLES)    </p>
<p>(SQUEAKING)    </p>
<p>(SIGHS)    </p>

<p>(WHINES, BARKS)    </p>
<p>&quot;Dog having nightmare, perhaps about the root of it all.&quot;    </p>
<p>♪ ♪    </p>
<p>(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)    </p>
<p>(BARKS)    </p>
<p>Oh, you poor thing.    </p>
<p>Have some Lambien. It'll help you sleep.    </p>
<p>(MOANS CONTENTEDLY)    </p>
<p>Dad, am I gonna get my dog back?    </p>
<p>(LAUGHS): Of course.    </p>
<p>But just in case, I know this isn't the kind of thing a father says to his son, but let's pray.    </p>
<p>Almighty patron saint of dogs, Saint Bernard...    </p>
<p>- Oh, can I join in?<br />
- Sure.    </p>
<p>- I'll pray, too.<br />
- Wow.    </p>
<p>Losing our dog, possibly forever, has really brought us together.    </p>
<p>No!    </p>
<p>Sorry, sorry. Back to the prayer.    </p>
<p>Okay, now I need to see what set you off.    </p>
<p>How do you feel about Marge?    </p>
<p>(SNIFFING, PANTING)    </p>

<p>(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)    </p>
<p>(SIGHS)    </p>
<p>She is comfort. Hmm.    </p>
<p>- So, what happened?<br />
- CLAY: Elaine?    </p>
<p>Hello?    </p>
<p>The car is here. Tuscany awaits.    </p>
<p>Oh, Clay.    </p>
<p>Ugh, I should have called.    </p>
<p>Darling, I've done something impulsive.    </p>
<p>You know how Mother always wanted you to wear her ring, but she died at a time when we had no hope.    </p>
<p>And in my heartache, I let them bury her with it.    </p>
<p>So I dug her up and, uh, will you marry me?    </p>
<p>I know &quot;exhumed&quot; isn't usually the most romantic word, but...    </p>
<p>Oh, Clay. I can't marry you now.    </p>
<p>But I can meet you in Tuscany in a few weeks.    </p>
<p>I might not be there.    </p>
<p>I can't compete with a wagging tail.    </p>
<p>Goodbye, Clay.    </p>
<p>I want you to know I'm already over you.    </p>
<p>- (WHIMPERING)<br />
- Oh, no, no, not your fault.    </p>
<p>Human nonsense. Let's get back to work.    </p>
<p>(CRIES)    </p>
<p>Today, I want you to interact with the pack.    </p>
<p>Mingle. Sniff a butt you don't know.    </p>
<p>- (SNIFFING)<br />
- (GROWLING)    </p>
<p>- (BARKS)<br />
- (YELPING)    </p>
<p>Okay, interesting.    </p>
<p>Let's explore that.    </p>
<p>(WHIMPERING)    </p>
<p>(BARKING)    </p>
<p>You buried this here. Why?    </p>
<p>Is this the key that unlocks your psyche?    </p>
<p>Bark once for &quot;yes,&quot; bark twice for &quot;that's too simplistic a view of canine psychology.&quot;    </p>
<p>(BARKS TWICE)    </p>
<p>Oh, hi. Is that our dog?    </p>
<p>(WHISPERS): Or one that looks just like it to fool the kids?    </p>
<p>(GASPS) You're back! Aw.    </p>
<p>Where did this come from?    </p>
<p>Uh, I would have to say the North Pole?    </p>
<p>Wait, Dad?<br />
That was the hat I was wearing the night we got Santa's Little Helper, remember?    </p>
<p>- Go! Go! Come on, boy!<br />
- Go, Santa's Little Helper!    </p>
<p>- Run! Run!<br />
- Come on! Get that rabbit!    </p>
<p>ANNOUNCER: Dog of w*r coming up fast on the outside...    </p>
<p>Aw, can we keep him, Dad? Please?    </p>
<p>But he's a loser. He's pathetic.    </p>
<p>He's... a Simpson.    </p>
<p>Santa's Little Helper was a racing dog?    </p>
<p>(SCOFFS) Not much of one.<br />
Even I could b*at him.    </p>
<p>Oh, it's all clear now.    </p>
<p>Your dog has PTSD.    </p>
<p>And he has to confront his abuser,    </p>
<p>and he's gonna do it right now.    </p>
<p>Actually, we're in the middle of a holiday brunch, so...    </p>
<p>But I-I'm with you.    </p>
<p>Uh, goodbye, everybody.    </p>
<p>So, how many balls are we allowed of croquembouche?    </p>
<p>Let's see if they have HBO GO.    </p>
<p>I've wanted to watch Euphoria, but I'm embarrassed to have it in my viewing history.    </p>
<p>Les Moore? Greyhound trainer?    </p>
<p>- Yeah, that's me.<br />
- Dog abuser!    </p>
<p>Can I offer you a drink to throw in my face?    </p>
<p>- Yeah, I'd like that.<br />
- Yes, I bet you would.    </p>
<p>I was being sarcastic, naturally.    </p>
<p>(GRUNTS)    </p>
<p>Not all trainers are monsters.    </p>
<p>Yeah, I remember this mutt.<br />
Uh, Santa's Little Helper.    </p>
<p>Yeah! Hey, what'd you rename him?    </p>
<p>- We didn't.<br />
- Boy, are you lazy.    </p>
<p>He was born to one of the fastest in the business, She Biscuit.    </p>
<p>Oh, he was her favorite.    </p>
<p>And boy, did he love her.    </p>
<p>That's how we learned how fast he was.    </p>
<p>So naturally, we took him from his mother forever.    </p>
<p>- (LOUD SLAP)<br />
- Did you just slap me again?    </p>
<p>- That was me.<br />
- You cut the line.    </p>
<p>- I want to slap. (GRUNTS)<br />
- Ow.    </p>
<p>- (GRUNTING)<br />
- Ow. Ow.    </p>
<p>- Here, Maggie.<br />
- Ow.    </p>
<p>There. Now we've all had a turn.    </p>
<p>- Not quite.<br />
- (GROWLING)    </p>
<p>Ow! Okay, I get it.    </p>
<p>Boy, suddenly, the guy who tortures dogs is the bad guy.    </p>
<p>(WHIMPERING)    </p>
<p>Now what does he want?    </p>
<p>(&quot;THE WAY WE WERE&quot; PLAYING)    </p>
<p>Son of a g*n.    </p>
<p>Where's he going?    </p>
<p>Uh... (CLEARS THROAT)    </p>
<p>To his, uh, to his mother.    </p>
<p>Oh, I love happy endings.    </p>
<p>♪ ♪    </p>
<p>♪ Memories ♪    </p>
<p>♪ Light the corners of my mind... ♪    </p>
<p>He'll be all right now.<br />
(CHUCKLES, SNIFFLES)    </p>
<p>Thank you so much.    </p>
<p>Oh, you're welcome.    </p>
<p>(SIGHS) I better be getting home.    </p>
<p>I've got    dogs to walk. (CHUCKLES)    </p>
<p>I could, uh, use some help.    </p>
<p>(MARGE GRUMBLES SOFTLY)    </p>
<p>Fine.    </p>
<p>It's so great everyone in this family worked out their issues.    </p>
