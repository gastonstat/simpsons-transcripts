<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Are we there yet?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Are we there yet?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Are we there yet?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Where are we going?</p>
<p>We're going to Storytown Village, Grampa.</p>
<p>It's an amusement park for babies.</p>
<p>Oh! Just leave me in the car with the window open a crack.</p>
<p>That's the plan.</p>
<p>I think it's nice we're doing something Maggie will enjoy for once.</p>
<p>Besides, I'm sure Storytown Village is also fun for everyone... from eight to God only knows.</p>
<p>Come out. Come out or I'll blow your house in.</p>
<p>Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chins.</p>
<p>What a load of crappy crap crap!</p>
<p>Quiet, boy.</p>
<p>I have a feeling some bad stuff is about to go down.</p>
<p>This is where the wolf blows down the pigs' house.</p>
<p>He blows, all right. He blows big-time.</p>
<p>That's it, honey. Get into the spirit.</p>
<p>Uh, it was good, but not great.</p>
<p>Somebody's been sleeping in my bed.</p>
<p>Somebody's been sleeping in my bed.</p>
<p>Somebody's been sleeping in my bed.</p>
<p>Well, I'm sorry. But it was a 150 degrees in the car.</p>
<p>So long, su-Aah!</p>
<p>Come on! Eat the can! Come on!</p>
<p>You're supposed to feed them pellets from the machine over there.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Oh, my!</p>
<p><em>Out of the way, you.!</em></p>
<p>Ahhh.</p>
<p>Oh, you are so cute. Yes, you are. You are.</p>
<p>I just love you.</p>
<p>See? It was a good idea to come here after all.</p>
<p><em>Attention, families. This is Mother Goose.</em></p>
<p>The following cars have been broken into-</p>
<p><em>Hmm?</p>
<p>Allemande left and do-si-diddley-diddley-do.</p>
<p>Swing your partner to-and-froodilly-fro.</p>
<p>All rightilly-dightilly.</p>
<p>Hey, Flanders.</em></p>
<p>Hidilly-ho, neighboreeno!</p>
<p>Shut up!</p>
<p>k*ll.</p>
<p>So, Ned, you're having a family reunion and you didn't invite me?</p>
<p>Oh, gosh, Homer. This is strictly a Flanders affair.</p>
<p>I got family here from around the globe.</p>
<p><em>Here's José Flanders.</p>
<p>Buenos ding-dong-diddly-días, senor.</em></p>
<p>And this is Lord Thistlewick Flanders.</p>
<p>Charmed.</p>
<p>Eh, a-googilly-doogilly.</p>
<p>I can't believe you didn't invite me, after I painted those cool stripes all over your car.</p>
<p>I know! I'll throw my own barbecue!</p>
<p>The greatest barbecue this town has ever seen.</p>
<p><em>And I'll only invite who I want. That'll show you.</em></p>
<p>Can I come?</p>
<p>Sure. D'oh!</p>
<p>This barbecue will be hard, thankless work. But I'm sure you're up to it, Marge.</p>
<p>Well, it could be a good chance to get to know our neighbors outside of a courtroom setting.</p>
<p>You know what you should serve, Marge?</p>
<p>More of these lamb chops. These are the best ever.</p>
<p>Why, thank you, Homie.</p>
<p>You might say the extra ingredient is salt.</p>
<p>Please, Lisa. I thought you loved me.</p>
<p>Loved me.</p>
<p>What's wrong, Lisa? Didn't you get enough lamb chops?</p>
<p>I can't eat this. I can't eat a poor little lamb.</p>
<p>Lisa, get ahold of yourself. This is &quot;lamb,&quot; not &quot;a lamb.&quot;</p>
<p>What's the difference between this lamb and the one that kissed me?</p>
<p>This one spent two hours in the broiler.</p>
<p><em>Bart, sensible bites.! All right, Lisa.</em></p>
<p>If you don't want lamb chops, there's lots of other things I can make.</p>
<p><em>Chicken breast, rump roast... hot dogs.</p>
<p>No, I can't!</em></p>
<p>I can't eat any of them!</p>
<p>Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.</p>
<p>Lisa, honey, are you saying you're never going to eat any animal again?</p>
<p>What about bacon?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Ham?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Pork chops?</p>
<p>Dad!</p>
<p>Those all come from the same animal!</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, right, Lisa.</p>
<p><em>A wonderful, magical animal.</em></p>
<p>I think Lisa's right, Dad. Eating meat is ba-a-a-ad.</p>
<p>Hey, that's my chop!</p>
<p>Oh, my family just doesn't understand my newfound vegetarianism.</p>
<p>Compared to them, the public schools are a haven of enlightenment.</p>
<p><em>Okay, class, time to dissect our worms.</em></p>
<p>First, pin them down so they don't fly up and hit you in the eye.</p>
<p>Um, Miss Hoover?</p>
<p>Yes, Ralph? What is it?</p>
<p>My worm went in my mouth and then I ate it. Can I have a new one?</p>
<p>No, Ralph. There aren't any more.</p>
<p>Just try to sleep while the other children are learning.</p>
<p>Oh, boy! Sleep! That's where I'm a Viking.</p>
<p>Lisa, what did I ever do to you-ou-ou?</p>
<p>Why does it talk like a lamb?</p>
<p>Uh, Miss Hoover, I don't think I can dissect an animal. I think it's wrong.</p>
<p>Okay, Lisa. I respect your moral objection.</p>
<p>Um, excuse me.</p>
<p>Isn't there anything here that doesn't have meat in it?</p>
<p>Possibly the meat loaf.</p>
<p>Well, I believe you're required to provide a vegetarian alternative.</p>
<p><em>Yum. It's rich in bunly goodness.</em></p>
<p>Do you remember when you lost your passion for this work?</p>
<p>Uh-oh. Two independent thought alarms in one day.</p>
<p>The students are over-stimulated.</p>
<p>Willie, remove all the colored chalk from the classrooms.</p>
<p>I warned ya! Didn't I warn ya?</p>
<p>That colored chalk was forged by Lucifer himself!</p>
<p><em>The Itchy and Scratchy Show</em></p>
<p>Mmm!</p>
<p>Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.</p>
<p>Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.</p>
<p>Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.</p>
<p>Mmm!</p>
<p>I never realized before, but some Itchy and Scratchy cartoons... send the message that violence against animals is funny.</p>
<p>Say what? Cartoons don't have messages, Lisa.</p>
<p>They're just a bunch of hilarious stuff, you know, like people getting hurt and stuff.</p>
<p>Stuff like that- Ohh!</p>
<p>Look, kids.</p>
<p>I just got my party invitations back from the printers.</p>
<p>&quot;Come to Homer's BBBQ.</p>
<p>The extra 'B' is for BYOBB.&quot;</p>
<p>What's that extra &quot;B&quot; for?</p>
<p>That's a typo.</p>
<p>Dad, can't you have some other kind of party? One where you don't serve meat?</p>
<p>But all normal people love meat.</p>
<p>If I went to a barbecue and there was no meat, I would say, &quot;Yo, goober! Where's the meat?&quot;</p>
<p>I'm trying to impress people here, Lisa. You don't win friends with salad.</p>
<p>You don't win friends with salad.</p>
<p>You don't win friends with salad.</p>
<p>You don't win friends with salad.</p>
<p>You don't win friends with salad.</p>
<p>You don't win friends with salad <em>You don't win friends with salad</em></p>
<p>You don't win friends with salad.</p>
<p>You don't win friends with salad.</p>
<p>You don't win friends with salad.</p>
<p>Mom!</p>
<p>I didn't mean to take sides. I just got caught up in the rhythm.</p>
<p>Good morning, class. A certain... agitator-</p>
<p>For privacy's sake, let's call her Lisa S.</p>
<p>No, that's too obvious. Uh, let's say L. Simpson- has raised questions about certain school policies.</p>
<p>So, in the interest of creating an open dialogue, sit silently and watch this film.</p>
<p>Nothing b*at a stroll in cattle country.</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Troy McClure.</p>
<p><em>You may remember me from such educational films as Two Minus Three Equals Negative Fun.!</p>
<p>And Firecrackers: The Silent k*ll.</p>
<p>Mr. McClure?</em></p>
<p>Oh, hello, Bobby.</p>
<p>Jimmy.</p>
<p>I'm curious as to how meat gets from the ranch to my stomach.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, Jimmy. You just asked a mouthful.</p>
<p><em>It all starts here in the high-density feedlot.</em></p>
<p>Then when the cattle are just right-</p>
<p>Mmm! it's time for them to &quot;graduate&quot; from Bovine University.</p>
<p>Come on, Jimmy. Let's take a peek at the k*ll floor.</p>
<p>Don't let the name throw you, Jimmy.</p>
<p>It's not really a floor. It's more of a steel grating... that allows material to sluice through so it can be collected and exported.</p>
<p>Getting hungry, Jimmy?</p>
<p>Uh, Mr. McClure, I have a crazy friend... who says it's wrong to eat meat.</p>
<p>Is he crazy?</p>
<p>No, just ignorant.</p>
<p>You see, your crazy friend never heard of the food chain.</p>
<p>Just ask this scientician.</p>
<p>Uh-</p>
<p>He'll tell you that in nature one creature invariably eats another to survive.</p>
<p>Don't kid yourself, Jimmy.</p>
<p>If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about.</p>
<p>Wow, Mr. McClure! I was a Grade A moron to ever question eating meat.</p>
<p>Yes, you were, Jimmy. Yes, you were.</p>
<p>Ow. You're hurting me.</p>
<p>They can't seriously expect us to swallow that tripe.</p>
<p>Now as a special treat, courtesy of our friends at the meat council... please help yourselves to this tripe.</p>
<p><em>Stop it.! Stop it.!</em></p>
<p>Don't you realize you've just been brainwashed by corporate propaganda?</p>
<p>Apparently, my crazy friend here hasn't heard of the food chain.</p>
<p>Yeah. Lisa's a Grade A moron.</p>
<p>When I grow up, I'm going to Bovine University.</p>
<p>Hi, Homer. Thanks for inviting me to your barbecue.</p>
<p>Whoa, Barney! You brought a whole beer keg!</p>
<p>Yeah. Where can I fill it up?</p>
<p><em>Wait, Dad.! Good news, everyone.!</em></p>
<p>You don't have to eat meat! I made enough gazpacho for all!</p>
<p>I don't like gazpacho.</p>
<p>What's that anyway?</p>
<p>It's tomato soup served ice cold.</p>
<p><em>Go back to Russia.</em></p>

<p>Ah, diagnosis... delicious.</p>
<p>I've got the prescription for you, Doctor.</p>
<p>Another hot beef injection.</p>
<p>Hey, Homer. Bring me another one of them, uh, burgers, would you?</p>
<p>I can't quite seem to... stand up under my own power anymore.</p>
<p>One whopper for the copper.</p>
<p>Another burger, Dad?</p>
<p>Here you go!</p>
<p>It's bad enough they're all eating meat.</p>
<p>They don't have to rub it in my face.</p>
<p>Okay, everybody. It's the moment you've all been waiting for.</p>
<p>The pig de résistance.</p>
<p>Look at his nose.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Homer. Your &quot;Q&quot; is a huge success.</p>
<p>Hey, a toast to the host who can boast the most roast!</p>
<p>Thanks, Flanders.</p>
<p>I have to agree that everything certainly- Huh?</p>
<p>Bart! No!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Sorry. Force of habit.</p>
<p>Lisa! No!</p>
<p><em>Uhh! Ohh!</p>
<p>It's just a little dirty. It's still good. It's still good.</em></p>
<p>It's just a little slimy. It's still good. It's still good.</p>
<p>It's just a little airborne. It's still good. It's still good.</p>
<p>It's gone.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>You know, Smithers, I think I'll donate a million dollars to the local orphanage... when pigs fly.</p>
<p>That's a good one. Hey- Hey-</p>
<p>Wh-Wha-</p>
<p>Will you be donating that million dollars now, sir?</p>
<p>No. I'd still prefer not.</p>
<p>Give it up, Dad. Piggy ain't coming back.</p>
<p>Lisa, you ruined my barbecue!</p>
<p>I demand you apologize this second!</p>
<p>I'm never, ever apologizing, because I was standing up for a just cause!</p>
<p>And you were wrong, wrong, wrong!</p>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to my room!</p>
<p>That's it! Go to your room!</p>
<p>Marge, since I'm not talking to Lisa... would you please ask her to pass me the syrup?</p>
<p>Please pass your father the syrup, Lisa.</p>
<p>Bart, tell Dad I'll only pass the syrup if it won't be used on any meat product.</p>
<p>You dunking your sausages in that syrup, homeboy?</p>
<p>Marge, tell Bart I just want to drink a nice glass of syrup like I do every morning.</p>
<p>Tell him yourself. You're ignoring Lisa, not Bart.</p>
<p>Bart, thank your mother for pointing that out.</p>
<p><em>Homer, you're not not talking to me. And, secondly, I heard what you said.</em></p>
<p>Lisa, tell your mother to get off my case.</p>
<p>Uh, Dad, Lisa's the one you're not talking to.</p>
<p>Bart, go to your room!</p>
<p>Why don't you just eat him, Dad?</p>
<p>I don't need any serving suggestions from you... you barbecue-wrecking, know-nothing, know-it-all.</p>
<p>That's it! I can't live in a house with this prehistoric carnivore!</p>
<p>I am out of here!</p>
<p>That's it! Go to your room!</p>
<p>Look! It's Mrs. Potato Head.</p>
<p>She has a head made out of lettuce.</p>
<p>I can't believe I used to go out with you.</p>
<p>Are you gonna marry a carrot, Lisa?</p>
<p>Yes, I'm gonna marry a carrot.</p>
<p>She admitted it!</p>
<p>She admitted she's gonna marry a carrot!</p>
<p>I can't believe it.</p>
<p>Your windows.</p>
<p>Mmm! The next-</p>
<p>The whole world wants me to eat meat! I can't fight it anymore!</p>
<p>There! Is everybody happy now?</p>
<p>I take it from your yelling that you like my tofu dogs.</p>
<p>Tofu?</p>
<p>Oh, yes. No meat whatsoever.</p>
<p>And only thrice the fat of a normal hot dog.</p>
<p>I made the switch and nobody noticed.</p>
<p>But why, Apu?</p>
<p>Because I'm a vegetarian. Haven't you ever seen my T-shirt?</p>
<p>That's cute.</p>
<p>Here. Let me show you something, Lisa.</p>
<p>Wow! A secret staircase.</p>
<p>But what do you do if somebody wants a nonalcoholic beer?</p>
<p>You know, it's never come up.</p>
<p><em>Oh, Apu, it's beautiful.</em></p>
<p>Yes. This is where I come when I need some refuge from the modern world... or when I want to see drive-in movies for free.</p>
<p>I know it is not easy to be a vegetarian, Lisa.</p>
<p><em>That's why I ran away from home.</p>
<p>What? She's leaving home?</p>
<p>Wow.! Paul McCartney.!</em></p>
<p>I read about you in history class. But where's your wife, Linda?</p>
<p>Right here, Lisa. Whenever we're in Springfield... we like to hang out in Apu's garden in the shade.</p>
<p>We met him in lndia years ago during the Maharishi days.</p>
<p>Back then I was known as the fifth b*at.</p>
<p>Sure you were, Apu.</p>
<p>You know what, Lisa? Paul and Linda are vegetarians too.</p>
<p>In fact, Linda has her own line of vegetarian entrees.</p>
<p>Apu, I'm sure the last thing they want to talk about is-</p>
<p>We weren't satisfied with the other vegetarian meals on the market.</p>
<p>You'd be surprised how often you'd find a big hunk of pork in them.</p>
<p>Ew!</p>
<p>Linda and I both feel strongly about animal rights.</p>
<p>In fact, if you play &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot; backwards... you'll hear a recipe for a really ripping lentil soup.</p>
<p>When will all those fools learn that you can be perfectly healthy... simply eating vegetables, fruits, grains and cheese?</p>
<p>Ooh, cheese!</p>
<p>You don't eat cheese, Apu?</p>
<p>No, I don't eat any food that comes from an animal.</p>
<p>Oh! Then you must think I'm a monster.</p>
<p>Yes, indeed, I do think that.</p>
<p>But I learned long ago, Lisa, to tolerate others rather than forcing my beliefs on them.</p>
<p><em>You know, you can influence people without badgering them always.</em></p>
<p>It's like Paul's song, &quot;Live and Let Live.&quot;</p>
<p>It was &quot;Live and Let Die.&quot;</p>
<p>Whatever, whatever. It had a good rhythm.</p>
<p>I guess I have been pretty hard on a lot of people, especially my dad. Thanks, you guys.</p>
<p>Lisa, before you go, would you like to hear a song?</p>
<p>Wow! That'd be great!</p>
<p>Okay. Take it, Apu.</p>
<p>Lisa.</p>
<p>Lisa!</p>
<p>Lisa, come back before everyone finds out what a horrible father I am!</p>
<p><em>Hi, Dad. Looking for me?</em></p>
<p>I don't know. Were you looking for me?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Oh, Lisa. I was looking for you.</p>
<p>I wanted to apologize.</p>
<p>I don't know exactly what went wrong, but I know it's always my fault.</p>
<p>Actually, Dad, this time I was wrong-</p>
<p>Oh. too.</p>
<p>While I was gone, I got some really good advice from Paul and Linda McCartney.</p>
<p>Rock stars. Is there anything they don't know?</p>
<p>I still stand by my beliefs. But I can't defend what I did.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I messed up your barbecue.</p>
<p>I understand, honey. I used to believe in things when I was a kid.</p>
<p>Come on! I'll give you a piggyback ride- Uh, oops!</p>
<p>I mean, a veggieback ride home.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
