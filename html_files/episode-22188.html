<p>(SCREAMING) (TIRES SCREECHING)</p>
<p>Oh, God, I love to smoke.</p>
<p>We're live at the opening of the latest chapter of the epic space saga, Cosmic Wars.</p>
<p>And the nerds have emerged from their basements, wearing strange costumes to shield their pasty skin from the moonlight.</p>
<p>Simpsons, your lack of costumes ill befits line positions two, three and four.</p>
<p>Where's your costume?</p>
<p>Your ignorance is amusing and sad.</p>
<p>I am dressed in the actual clothing worn by Cosmic Wars creator Randall Curtis.</p>
<p>I bought them at auction, then added pregnancy panels to fit my unique body type.</p>
<p>One ticket for the space show.</p>
<p>I want to see if any of them aliens match up to the one I got in my root cellar.</p>
<p>One ticket for Cosmic Wars.</p>
<p>Uh, sir, this is the line for The Momentum of Things, starring Ellen Burstyn and Jim Broadbent.</p>
<p>Oh, man! I waited three weeks at the wrong ticket window!</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Oh, boy...</p>
<p>Man, even I think movie popcorn has gotten too big.</p>
<p>Ow! Get your own, mooch!</p>
<p>(Jeff) Yes! Finally.</p>
<p>&quot;Amendments&quot;? &quot;Regulatory agencies&quot;?</p>
<p>What the farq butt?</p>
<p>Don't worry. They're just getting the plot out of the way so it won't slow down the...</p>
<p>(IMITATES LIGHTSABER FIRING)</p>
<p>(IMITATES LIGHTSABER WHOOSHING)</p>
<p>(ROARS)</p>
<p>Before the Galactic Senate votes, we shall call roll.</p>
<p>Star System Avatan.</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>Star System Acroilius.</p>
<p>(Acroilius Senator) Mugong-mugong.</p>
<p>Star System Trebulon Prime.</p>
<p>Whoa, mama! Finally some action!</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I propose a procedural amendment to Space Bill number 371.</p>
<p>You'll wait your turn!</p>
<p>Very well.</p>
<p>Trebulon Minor.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm so bored. Maybe I'll clean out my wallet.</p>
<p>Hey, my car insurance expired quite a while ago.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>Son, if you don't dig more coal, they'll put you on the dynamite gang.</p>
<p>No dynamite!</p>
<p>(SOBBING)</p>
<p>I didn't realize British coal miners had it so bad.</p>
<p>There's bl*od on your hands, Mrs. Thatcher!</p>
<p>(SNORING)</p>
<p>Jim-Jam, what happened to the wheel covers of my landing gear?</p>
<p>Me-sa sell them to buy me-sa some space spliff.</p>
<p>That character is just a tired stereotype.</p>
<p>Yes. And it's making me so mad, how am I gonna throw the meatballs at the screen?</p>
<p>But first, I gotta pose for a pizza box.</p>
<p>The decision is final. Tabled this motion is. Or is it?</p>
<p>That sucked!</p>
<p>I can't believe The Gathering Shadow was senate redistricting.</p>
<p>Worst Cosmic Wars ever! I will only see it three more times today.</p>
<p>That's it!</p>
<p>From now on, I'm not looking forward to anything!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Tomorrow, there's a two-for-one sale on piano benches!</p>
<p>I can't wait!</p>
<p>Ooh, ooh, ooh!</p>
<p>I feel so ripped off by that crappy movie.</p>
<p>I'm gonna chip a big hole in the floor.</p>
<p>Kids, why don't you write a complaint letter?</p>
<p>That's how I got the Channel 6 weather girl to start wearing a bra.</p>
<p>That was you?</p>
<p>Mmm-hmm.</p>
<p>A letter, huh? Okay, Lise. Get this down.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear Randall Curtis,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;your movie stunk smelly butt. I am fine. Sincerely...&quot;</p>
<p>I'll write the letter.</p>
<p>Marge, you destroyed my interest in weather!</p>
<p>&quot;Dear Cosmic Wars fan, I'm glad you loved my film.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here's a photo of your favorite new character, Jim-Jam Bonks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;May the power be on your side, Randall Curtis.&quot;</p>
<p>He ignored our criticisms!</p>
<p>We're gonna have to track Randall Curtis down and make him listen to us.</p>
<p>And I know just where to find him.</p>
<p>742 Evergreen Terrace.</p>
<p>Dad, that's our address.</p>
<p>Ah! He's in the house?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>He lives at the Cosmic Wars Ranch in Northern California.</p>
<p>(IN UNISON) Can we go? Can we go?</p>
<p>Please, please, please, please, please?</p>
<p>Well, Northern California is wine country. We could take a tour.</p>
<p>And it's a perfect time. I just got fired again.</p>
<p>Enjoy your tour. And take it easy on Mr. Curtis.</p>
<p>Your father and I will be across the street at the Lush Valley Winery.</p>
<p>Marge, are you sure we should go drinking together?</p>
<p>I mean, who am I gonna complain about while I'm drinking?</p>
<p>We should do more together. You're my best friend, Homie.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, legally.</p>
<p>But if we're really best friends, how come we never play hoops?</p>
<p>The doctor said if you tried running again, your ankles would shatter.</p>
<p>All right. We'll go on the winery tour.</p>
<p>But you have to catch me first!</p>
<p>(SNAPPING) (SCREAMS IN PAIN)</p>
<p>Oh, my ankle snapped!</p>
<p>This is the Creature Works, where if you dream it, we can make it.</p>
<p>Unless it has too many fingers, which are tough.</p>
<p>(Tourist) Where's the aliens?</p>
<p>Who knows what fantastic creature these two men are creating?</p>
<p>It's a hip-hop loaf of garlic bread for an Olive Garden commercial.</p>
<p>(RAPPING) Yo, yo, yo! Entrees start at $6.95</p>
<p>Offer not good on a Sunday, fool.</p>
<p>Come on, Bart. Here's our chance.</p>
<p>But the bread's still dancing.</p>
<p>The Mediterranean climate is reproduced by cool Pacific winds mixed with exhaust fumes from the highway.</p>
<p>(HONKING)</p>
<p>Ah. Summer in Tuscany.</p>
<p>Mmm... it goes great with the Jolly Rancher I'm sucking on.</p>
<p>Pleasant aroma, rich, full body, well-aged and the wine's not bad either.</p>
<p>(BOTH LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Oh, stop it, Seinfeld.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLING)</p>
<p>We always get the hicks on Saturdays.</p>
<p>&quot;Lord Krylac, if you want to take that deduction,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;then you'll have to bring your receipts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then bring them, I shall.&quot;</p>
<p>This is awesome!</p>
<p>Hey, what are you doing here?</p>
<p>We come from the real world.</p>
<p>And we're here to tell you that your movies have lost their way.</p>
<p>No, they haven't.</p>
<p>My characters are getting better all the time now that we've perfected digital eyelash rendering.</p>
<p>Better technology doesn't mean better storytelling.</p>
<p>Well, now I know you're crazy.</p>
<p>Wait. Before you have us k*ll, hear us out.</p>
<p>I will wait 10 of your Earth seconds.</p>
<p>Your early movies are timeless classics.</p>
<p>Please, Mr. Curtis, go back to what made your first films so great.</p>
<p>You know what? You're right.</p>
<p>I'm going back to my roots.</p>
<p>Plots and characters lifted from westerns and samurai films.</p>
<p>To the video store!</p>
<p>Kids, please accept these boxes of Jim-Jam cereal.</p>
<p>It's just Alpha-Bits with extra J's.</p>
<p>Hyah!</p>
<p>Well, we've learned if you don't like something, just go to the office and complain.</p>
<p>What's our next stop?</p>
<p>&quot;Fox Broadcasting,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;10201 West Pico, Building 203.&quot;</p>
<p>I drank this much!</p>
<p>(LAUGHS DRUNKENLY)</p>
<p>Mom's not gonna like this.</p>
<p>Don't tell Mama what Mama don't like.</p>
<p>Come here, you big lug.</p>
<p>(BOTH LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Wow. Mom and Dad sure are having fun.</p>
<p>Hey, as long as they're not hurting anybody.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>I will give you money. Okay, I am going to tell.</p>
<p>Homie, to store the extra wine we bought, I made a little wine cellar.</p>
<p>Ooh! Can I have my special cup?</p>
<p>Well, I've been using it for laundry soap, but, okay.</p>
<p>Homie, you are so cute.</p>
<p>(GIGGLING)</p>
<p>Oh, honey, I love to hear you laugh.</p>
<p>(IMITATES MARGE GIGGLING)</p>
<p>I don't talk like that.</p>
<p>(IMITATING MARGE) Yes, you do.</p>
<p>Well, you talk like, (IMITATING HOMER) &quot;Oh, Marge&quot;, &quot;sorry I set the bed on fire. D'oh!&quot;</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Hey, you do a great me, Marge.</p>
<p>You gotta show the guys at Moe's!</p>
<p>Moe's Tavern?</p>
<p>That's your fun place, like me and the lamp store.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES) Come on. We'll have a blast.</p>
<p>Kids, while we're out, the TV's in charge.</p>
<p>Go to bed when it says.</p>
<p>Two glasses of wine, Moe.</p>
<p>Wine? Geez, no one ever orders that.</p>
<p>Um... All I got's this old stuff here.</p>
<p>Chateau Latour 1886.</p>
<p>I should just throw this out.</p>
<p>No. It'll have to do.</p>
<p>That'll be four bucks.</p>
<p>Now, in a step I perhaps should've taken initially, let me look up the value of that bottle in this wine collector's guide here.</p>
<p>Oh, what have I done?</p>
<p>Let me dry my tears with this lost Shakespeare play.</p>
<p>(SOBBING)</p>
<p>Come here, you little...</p>
<p>(GIGGLING) Oh!</p>

<p>Did you guys get home at 2:00 last night?</p>
<p>Yup. Your mother and I have become a legendary party couple, like Scott and Zelda Munster.</p>
<p>The best part is I don't have to ask your father where he was all night, because I was there.</p>
<p>Why are your keys in my scrambled eggs?</p>
<p>And why is Krusty on the couch?</p>
<p>This'll cover what I did to the fireplace. (GROANS)</p>
<p>(SINGING) We're all alone No chaperone can get our number.</p>

<p>You have to make such an unholy racket?</p>
<p>Sorry, Marge. I gotta break in my ski boots sometime.</p>
<p>Maybe we should put this booze cruise in dry dock for awhile.</p>
<p>No problem. We can still have fun without you drinking.</p>
<p>Okay. And maybe you could cut back, too.</p>
<p>You got it! And when I feel weak, I will draw strength from the Bible.</p>
<p>(STOMACH GRUMBLING) Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Here comes the gospel according to puke!</p>
<p>I hope I can still have fun while everyone else is drinking.</p>
<p>Don't worry, honey. I don't even know if they serve alcohol at this thing.</p>

<p>You can just nurse it!</p>
<p>(SLURPS)</p>
<p>Nurse it. Nurse it.</p>
<p>Have you ever walked on stilts? It's not that great.</p>
<p>Yes. And you've said that several times now.</p>
<p>Why do people worry about stuff?</p>
<p>It's all gonna work out.</p>
<p>All good points. Sleep tight, my drunken angel.</p>

<p>I'm in no condition to drive.</p>
<p>Wait! I shouldn't listen to myself. I'm drunk!</p>

<p>That's my girl.</p>
<p>Just take me home.</p>
<p>Where's your wife tonight, Homer?</p>
<p>She's not coming anymore. What?</p>
<p>It's 'cause of her I put in a bidet!</p>
<p>Well, it's actually just a stepladder by the water fountain.</p>
<p>Listen, Moe. I did something really terrible to someone I love.</p>
<p>Hey, look. I've been in the bartender business for a long time, all right?</p>
<p>I've heard it all.</p>

<p>What are you? You're like a monster!</p>
<p>That's like the worst thing I've ever heard anybody do to anybody!</p>
<p>You should be drinking watered-down beer in a chipped glass on a stool with a nail sticking up out of it!</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>(SOBBING)</p>
<p>Can I have some peanuts?</p>
<p>All right. But I get to poke you with a stick.</p>

<p>Hey, save some for the rest of us, alkie!</p>
<p>Don't bogart our Lord!</p>
<p>I'm not a drunk! (CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>Now, Marge, we do not judge here.</p>
<p>Today's service is concluded.</p>
<p>I suggest you all get on the road before Marge.</p>
<p>(ALL SCREAM)</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>Marge, when I finally decided to stop drinking, there was a place that really helped me out.</p>
<p>Maybe they can help you.</p>
<p><strong>Marge</strong>: This is a pamphlet for chimney sweeping.</p>
<p>Is it, Marge? Ls it? Oh, it is.</p>
<p>Here you go. This place is great.</p>
<p>They cured me five times!</p>
<p>My drinking problem is out of control.</p>
<p>At Oktoberfest, all I could think about was beer.</p>
<p>I couldn't even celebrate the harvest!</p>
<p>I can't talk to my wife for 28 days?</p>
<p>Sir, she is not an alcoholic.</p>
<p>You can't put me on hold!</p>
<p>I'll put you on hold!</p>
<p>(SINGING) I am a lineman for the county.</p>
<p>Your call is important to us. Please continue to hold.</p>
<p>And I drive the main road.</p>
<p>There are eight calls ahead of you.</p>
<p>And the Wichita lineman is still on the (VOCALIZING) line.</p>
<p>Dad, I still have a couple of questions about this.</p>
<p>Mom never drives drunk.</p>
<p>And the crash was in your car.</p>
<p>Also, the driver's seat was adjusted for your stomach.</p>
<p>Lisa, Lisa, your suspicions are important to me and will be answered in the order received.</p>
<p>MacArthur Park is melting in the dark.</p>
<p>All that sweet green icing rolling down.</p>
<p>Someone left my cake out in the...</p>
<p>(VOCALIZING)</p>
<p>(SHOUTS) (DOOR SLAMS)</p>
<p>You know how some people are chocoholics?</p>
<p>Well, I'm an alcoholic.</p>
<p>(ALL GASP)</p>
<p>Look, I'm not sure this place is working.</p>
<p>The drinkers are smoking. The smokers are drinking.</p>
<p>And the gamblers are having sex with everything that moves.</p>
<p>Hey, baby, do you want to play Caribbean stud?</p>
<p>I'll show you what I'm holding.</p>
<p>Get away from me!</p>
<p>Your loss, stupid lady.</p>
<p>Flanders, can you watch my kids while I'm at the rehab clinic?</p>
<p>Oh, thank God you're finally fighting your demons!</p>
<p>My demons and I are closer than ever.</p>
<p>Next year, we're gonna visit every Major League Baseball park.</p>
<p>I'm just going in to bust Marge out.</p>
<p>Well, that's good, too, I guess.</p>
<p>Feed my pets and tape my shows!</p>
<p>(FUNNY VOICE) I'm here to deliver a package to Marge Simpson.</p>
<p>Where's the package?</p>
<p>Damn it! Homer?</p>
<p>Marge, I have an awful confession to make.</p>
<p>You didn't crash that car. It was me!</p>
<p>I put you behind the wheel, and I'm so, so, so sorry!</p>
<p>You let me believe that I'd done such a terrible thing?</p>
<p>Marge, I did it out of love! Love of not being arrested!</p>
<p>I realize now that nothing is more important than you.</p>
<p>I can't believe you did that to me!</p>
<p>That woman means the world to me.</p>
<p>Would it be all right if I read from my Bible?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>(GULPS)</p>
<p>No wonder they call it the Good Book.</p>
<p>I am so cheesed off! I need a drink!</p>
<p>Then you should thank God you're in a rehab center, 'cause we're packin'!</p>
<p>Yar. A couple of these and your first mate turns into Reese Witherspoon.</p>
<p>Pour me another!</p>
<p>Just take the whole leg.</p>
<p>What's with all those rapping grannies in the movies?</p>
<p>If I ever start rapping, just sh**t me in the head.</p>
<p>How you doing, Big Blue?</p>
<p>Well, I feel a buzz, but I don't feel happier.</p>
<p>Not like when I was drinking with Homer.</p>
<p>Maybe it wasn't the alcohol you liked.</p>
<p>Hey, you are right!</p>
<p>What I enjoyed was spending time with my husband!</p>
<p>You're hooked on love, Marge. I know that feeling.</p>
<p>Nine months later, Seymour plopped out of me.</p>
<p>I would've kept walking, but there were cops everywhere.</p>
<p>Well, I love my husband. And I'm glad I do.</p>
<p>My name is Marge S. and I'm a Homer-holic!</p>
<p>Hey, you're drinking Homer-hol? I'll take a swig.</p>
<p>I'm afraid what I like can't be swallowed, sniffed or smoked.</p>
<p>Hmm. Then you better inject it between my toes, because my mom checks my arms.</p>
<p>Thanks for everything, Kyle.</p>
<p>Yes. I really don't think you two should leave.</p>
<p>He's a chronic alcoholic, and you're in complete denial.</p>
<p>Aw, shut up, Captain Bringdown!</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>Homie, I want you to promise me you'll cut down on the drinking.</p>
<p>Okay, Marge. For you, I'll give up rum-based cocktails, except mojitos and rum and Cokes.</p>
<p>Well, that's no promise at all.</p>
<p>It's important for me to see you take at least one step.</p>
<p>Then maybe we can have some memories together that aren't just a nauseous blur.</p>
<p>All right. For you, I will give up all clear liquors.</p>
<p>Really? Even Zima?</p>
<p>Hey, I only drink that when I'm already drunk.</p>
<p>You really mean it?</p>
<p>Hey, anything's possible with a little help from my Bible.</p>
<p>Oh, no! It's a real one!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Why, God? Why?</p>
