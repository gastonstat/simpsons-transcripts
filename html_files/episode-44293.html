							<p>_   Homer, the results of your physical are very concerning.</p>
<p>- You're    pounds overweight. </p>
<p>- I wore my socks on the scale.</p>
<p>And your cholesterol is sky-high.</p>
<p>Go big or go home.</p>
<p>Oh, and your testosterone is just a little bit low.</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>Testosterone?</p>
<p>That's what fuels my punching and yelling.</p>
<p>And my undeserved confidence.</p>
<p>Now I'll never be an NFL quarterback/international superspy. </p>
<p>(MOANS)</p>
<p>Don't worry, low T is very common amongst men your age.</p>
<p>It can be treated with a prescription drug    called Vicodude.</p>
<p>- Pill me up. - But before I give you the drug, I just need you to watch this short informational video.</p>
<p>There's an ad first?</p>
<p>If I had more testosterone, I'd k*ll you.</p>
<p>A single truck can't possibly be best in its class in torque, towing and payload.</p>
<p>- (SHOUTS)</p>
<p>- Think again, Professor k*ll.</p>
<p>♪    <em>Man up with the Road Monster</em>    <em>Triple-XL    .</em>    <em>The Triple-XL     delivers ultimate tow,</em>    <em>ultimate payload</em>    <em>and ultimate torque.</em>    -  <em>The Triple-XL    .</em>    <em>It's what a man drives.</em>    Dr. Hibbert, you're a genius.</p>
<p>That truck is exactly what I need.</p>
<p>No, what you need is medication.</p>
<p>Wrong again, Professor k*ll.</p>
<p>See you next year.</p>
<p>Not if this chart is right.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Peonies are such interesting flowers.</p>
<p>They need less water, but... (SCREAMS)</p>
<p>Look what the doctor made me get.</p>
<p>(GROWLS)</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>You know it, baby.</p>
<p>The engine growls just like that.</p>
<p>And don't worry, it has maximum torque for its class and the highest possible ranking from J.D. Power.</p>
<p>What about his associates?</p>
<p>Oh, you know they're on board.</p>
<p>- (LAUGHS)</p>
<p>- Look at me.</p>
<p>I'm a payload.</p>
<p>This truck is an offense to everything I hold dear, and...</p>
<p>Oh, but it comes with a family subscription to Slapify, the music streaming service.</p>
<p>I don't know what that is, but I'm great for having it.</p>
<p>Whoa, and check out the picture on the back-up cam.</p>
<p>It even has infrared.</p>
<p>(THUDDING)</p>
<p>Okay, Slapify, let's see if your algorithm can predict my taste.</p>
<p>(SNICKERS)</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>Age: eight. Gender: female.</p>
<p>How did you hear about our service: truck.</p>
<p>Oh, it already has suggestions.</p>
<p>(POP MUSIC PLAYING)</p>
<p>Meh. A little trendy, not for me.</p>
<p>(ALTERNATIVE ROCK PLAYING)</p>
<p>Okay, but still pretty mainstream.</p>
<p>(SIGHS)</p>
<p>Good taste is a curse, but I'm sure a great song is just a click away.</p>
<p><em>- (MOUSE CLICKING)</p>
<p>- LISA: Mm-mm. Hmm. Uh...</em> </p>
<p>&quot;If you hate everything, you might like this.&quot;   </p>
<p>Quilloughby?</p>
<p>Never heard of him.</p>
<p>&quot;Quilloughby and his British bandmates, the Snuffs, &quot;dominated the '  s indie scene    with their brand of literate, sardonic...&quot;   </p>
<p>Ooh, sardonic.</p>
<p>&quot;...music that focused on Quilloughby's obsessions,    especially his militant vegetarianism.&quot;    ♪    ♪ <em>The flesh that you cover with cheese</em> ♪    ♪ <em>Is proof of your moral disease</em> ♪    ♪ <em>It's death for no reason</em> ♪    ♪ <em>And death for no reason</em> ♪    ♪ <em>Is hamburger homicide.</em> ♪   </p>
<p>(LOWING)</p>
<p>_    Oh!</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)</p>
<p>Quilloughby's music is so smart and dour and jangly and no one has seen him in years, he's a famous recluse.</p>
<p>And his commitment to animal rights is so inspiring.</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>I just had the most amazing idea.</p>
<p>Lisa doesn't like it when other people talk.</p>
<p>Attention, Elementarians.</p>
<p>Inspired by my new favorite musician, whom I'm sure you've never heard of, today is the first Mushroom Monday.</p>
<p>So dig in to these all-vegan mushroom tacos.</p>
<p>Mushrooms?</p>
<p>Those are chairs for toads.</p>
<p>Don't you see?</p>
<p>The flesh that you cover with cheese is proof of your moral disease.</p>
<p>Gah?</p>
<p>Just give them a chance.</p>
<p>So delicious.</p>
<p>Three kinds of ground mushrooms: portobello, shiitake...</p>
<p>Don't forget the yummy little pieces of bacon.</p>
<p>(SHOUTING, COUGHING)</p>
<p>Ew, ew, ew.</p>
<p>You said these were vegan.</p>
<p>But they are. Vegetables plus bacon.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Vegon.&quot;</em> Am I wrong?</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>I ate meat.</p>
<p>Haw-haw!</p>
<p>This taco had a mom.</p>
<p>ALL: Mmm...</p>
<p>(CRYING)</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>Everyone at my school is a jerk.</p>
<p>Why are they so mean?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Is the problem me?</p>
<p>QUILLOUGHBY: The problem is never you.</p>
<p>It's those sour-breathed know-nothing sheep who graze the blighted meadows of your so-called school.</p>
<p>Gah?</p>
<p>Okay, it was probably just a bacon hallucination.</p>
<p>Quilloughby isn't actually in my room.</p>
<p>I'm traumatized by eating meat.</p>
<p>You must stop talking to yourself.</p>
<p>People will think you've gone mad.</p>
<p>- (SCREAMS)</p>
<p>- ♪     You're not real the real Quilloughby. You're imaginary.</p>
<p>I've gone crazy.</p>
<p>♪ <em>Master of the obvious</em> ♪     ♪ <em>Ensconced in her dreadful red frock.</em> ♪  </p>
<p>I don't want to be crazy. Not this kind of crazy.</p>
<p>Just get out of here.</p>
<p>Hey, Lis, what you pointing at?</p>
<p>Some bacon you want to eat?</p>
<p>I've got a pig nose. Want to eat me?</p>
<p>(SNORTING)</p>
<p>(SNORTING, LAUGHS)</p>
<p>(ALL SNORTING)</p>
<p>(CRYING)</p>
<p>- (WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY)</p>
<p>- Oh.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Bart, slowly, almost imperceptibly, your friends are growing tired of you.</p>
<p>What... what?</p>
<p>I'm the drumstick of this chicken bucket.</p>
<p>(LAUGHS)</p>
<p>They're not getting tired of me.</p>
<p>Of course we're not, Bart.</p>
<p>Wait, what was that look?</p>
<p>What look?</p>
<p>(LISA CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>You guys are not getting tired of me.</p>
<p>(YAWNS)</p>
<p>No, no, I was just yawning because I stayed up late, thinking about your pranks.</p>
<p>Still so fresh.</p>
<p>(BOTH CHUCKLE)</p>
<p>Quilloughby, you completely ruined my brother with just one sentence.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Oh, there's nothing more tiresome than gratitude.</p>
<p>I think I'm gonna like hallucinating you.</p>
<p>Here's a gift. Put this on your faded Army jacket.</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>You think I'm cool enough to wear a faded Army jacket.</p>
<p>Hmm. Keep in mind, I'm merely a product of your fractured psyche.</p>
<p>Oh, shut up, don't ruin it.</p>
<p>(LAUGHS)</p>
<p>(HOMER HUMMING)</p>
<p>Hey, Homer, ever so slowly, your friends are growing tired of you.</p>
<p>With this much testosterone?</p>
<p>No way, baby.</p>
<p>Aw. Take me for a ride in your truck.</p>
<p>Trucks aren't for driving.</p>
<p>They're for doing kick-ass truck stuff.</p>
<p>Have you actually done any truck stuff?</p>
<p>Put it on.</p>
<p>♪     (GRUNTING, SHOUTING)</p>
<p>But I don't want this.</p>
<p>You're welcome!</p>
<p>♪   For an imaginary friend, you were really keen to get out of the house.</p>
<p>Ugh, that small woman was such a bore.</p>
<p>Oh. Maggie's a baby, and she was sleeping.</p>
<p>Even she knows it.</p>
<p>This place reminds me of my own hometown.</p>
<p>It's dismal and nothing good will ever come from it.</p>
<p>Well, almost nothing.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>Get out your tickers and tape, here comes the prat parade.</p>
<p>Facial hair is not a substitute for personality.</p>
<p>Two times zero is still zero.</p>
<p>(SNIFFS)</p>
<p>Bit early for the apricot brandy,     </p>
<p>- is it not, Vicar?</p>
<p>- (LAUGHS)</p>
<p>Quilloughby, is there anyone you do like?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, let me tell you something, Lisa.</p>

<p>- (PLAYS NOTE)</p>
<p>- Lisa Simpson.</p>
<p>Those measures were supposed to be pianissimo, but instead they were sforzando and scherzando.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES, WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)</p>
<p>(BOTH LAUGH)</p>
<p>Well, would you care to share your private tee-hees with the class?</p>
<p>I was just thinking, every day you wave that wand, and yet nothing magical ever happens.</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>You're a smart-mouthed little sass pants.</p>
<p>And you're a sad little man whose best days never happened.</p>
<p>(ALL GASPING)</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>I'm not sad, I'm happy.</p>
<p>And  ' &quot; is a very nice height for a fella.</p>
<p>(CRYING): Very nice.</p>
<p>Lisa, I enjoyed that.</p>
<p>And I enjoy nothing.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, I called you in here because Lisa's behavior has become wry, sardonic, and yes, poetically world-weary.</p>
<p>I know what's going on.</p>
<p>Lisa's become infatuated with this snobby, judgy, British crooner   </p>
<p>- from the '  s. - Hmm.</p>
<p>Hmm...</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>You're right to worry.</p>
<p>With the popularity of the Slapify streaming service, I'm seeing more children becoming lost     in the music of the past.</p>
<p>♪ <em>Oh, here she comes</em> ♪     ♪ <em>Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up</em> ♪     ♪ <em>Oh, here she comes</em> ♪     ♪ <em>She's a man-eater!</em> ♪  </p>
<p>Well, we take this very seriously.</p>
<p>My husband and I are going to have a heart-to-heart with our daughter tonight.</p>
<p>Isn't that right, Homer?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>You don't tow me!</p>
<p>I tow you!</p>
<p>Stop resisting!</p>
<p>Surrender to my mighty torque!</p>
<p>- Never!</p>
<p>- (BOTH GRUNTING)</p>
<p>(SEATBELT CLICKS, ENGINE STARTS)</p>
<p>(GRUNTING)</p>
<p>What has gotten into you?</p>
<p>You used to be such a happy little girl.</p>
<p>When?</p>
<p>Okay, but never like this...</p>
<p>with the sour attitude,     and the black booties.</p>
<p>You've become a crab... no, a pill!</p>
<p>Lisa, darling, please silence the din.</p>
<p>♪     (GRUNTS)</p>
<p>That's it!</p>
<p>I'm cancelling your music subscription.</p>
<p>Jiggly... and bloop.</p>
<p>(BOTH GASP)</p>
<p>Shocking.</p>
<p>(LISA STRAINING)</p>
<p>(QUILLOUGHBY MOANS)</p>
<p>How can Mom take away the only place I can hear your music?</p>
<p>Maybe not the only place.</p>
<p>Apparently, this is happening.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I can see you. I mean, the real you.</p>
<p>Well, you're in for a treat, my dear.</p>
<p>My live shows are, quote, &quot;like a three-hour dance party in a freshly-dug grave.&quot; David Fricke, <em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine,     .</p>
<p>Oh, but Marge will never let me go.</p>
<p>And even if she would, I don't have enough money.</p>
<p>Those tickets cost, like, five Lego sets.</p>
<p>Look in your pocket, Lisa.</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>My dad's credit card.</p>
<p>Did you steal this?</p>
<p>Did I?</p>
<p>A little of both. It's complicated.</p>
<p>Sometimes I identify as imaginary, but sometimes I can do this.</p>
<p>(GRUNTS, LAUGHS)</p>
<p>Ow, the zipper!</p>
<p>(BOTH GRUNTING, LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>(GRUNTING)</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I'm a little stressed out.</p>
<p>Making sandwiches calms my nerves.</p>
<p>Ooh, sandwiches!</p>
<p>Lisa is sullen, dressing weird, obsessed with English music...</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>Our eight-year-old has turned into a teenager.</p>
<p>Well, from now on, I'm going to pay very close attention to her.</p>
<p>Marge, little girls are a lot like all-wheel anti-lock brakes: when road conditions are unpredictable...</p>
<p>We're talking about your daughter, not a vehicle.</p>
<p>Well, both do have maximum torque for their class.</p>
<p>Will you shut up about the damn truck?</p>
<p>(WHIMPERS)</p>
<p>But the truck is who I am.</p>
<p>It's a perfect fit for my manly, off-road lifestyle.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>You hate the outdoors.</p>
<p>You've never been camping.</p>
<p>You've never hauled or towed anything, or shown any interest in hauling or towing.</p>
<p>And please, tell me the meaning of the word &quot;torque.&quot; The smoke hole where the truck's farts come out?</p>
<p><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content"><br />

<p>Torque is the tendency of a force to rotate the body to which it is applied. Like this!</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>Homer J. Simpson, you are not a truck guy!</p>
<p>(SOBBING)</p>
<p>Now, I'm going to deal with an actual problem: our daughter's pre-pre-teen rebellion.</p>
<p>(SCREAMS)</p>
<p>Lisa's gone!</p>
<p>I'm going to my first music festival with my best friend!</p>
<p>Uh, best imaginary friend.</p>
<p>Right. I guess I didn't need to buy two VIP passes, then.</p>
<p>Sorry, Dad!</p>
<p>(BOTH LAUGH)</p>
<p>Oh, the pain of laughter...</p>
<p>(LAUGHING)</p>
<p>Our daughter is by herself at an outdoor music whoop-de-doo!</p>
<p>And she's using my stolen credit card.</p>
<p>- (CHIMES)</p>
<p>- What?</p>
<p>- (CHIMES)</p>
<p>- Huh?</p>
<p>- (CHIMES)</p>
<p>- Hey...</p>
<p>No...</p>
<p>Ugh, this combines my two least favorite things...</p>
<p>other people's music, and other people.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we're going to see the real you perform.</p>
<p>Ooh, do you think you'll play &quot;Labour Action at the Biscuit Factory&quot; or &quot;Simon Has a Birthmark&quot;?</p>
<p>How dreadfully predictable...</p>
<p>but the nippers must suckle.</p>
<p>(PLAYING ROCK MUSIC)</p>
<p>Oh, these bands are all rubbish, and this sun is too... sunny.</p>
<p>Quilloughby, this festival is our dream.</p>
<p>Stop being such a, such a...</p>
<p>Such a pill?</p>
<p>Oh. Sorry,<em> Marge.</em> Hey, I'm just trying to have a fun day.</p>
<p>Oh, a &quot;fun day.&quot; Why don't we all just have fizzy drinks and rainbow lollipops?</p>
<p>Oh, la-di-da-di-da.</p>
<p>(SINGSONGY): Happy, happy, happy.</p>
<p>Vacuous animals waiting for the slaughter.</p>
<p>Well, it's a good thing Dad got this truck.</p>
<p>- Oh, my God. - You see, Marge?</p>
<p>- I never want to hear another word... </p>
<p>- Bart gets it.</p>
<p>- ...about this truck. </p>
<p>- The truck is awesome.</p>
<p>- It makes me so mad!</p>
<p>- You don't get it     </p>
<p>- and you never will!</p>
<p>- Truck this, truck that.</p>
<p>- Truck, truck, truck, truck... </p>
<p>- I wish I was married to Bart!</p>
<p>- _ - (CACKLING)</p>
<p>Ugh!</p>
<p>You never stop whining!</p>
<p>The term is &quot;whinging.&quot;     </p>
<p>- Conspicuous eye roll. </p>
<p>- (GROANS)</p>
<p>I used to think you just hated bad art and cruelty to animals and people who wear baseball hats, but it turns out you hate everything!</p>
<p>But, Lisa, I thought that was our bond.</p>
<p>ANNOUNCER: Coming now to the main stage...</p>
<p>- (CHEERING)</p>
<p>- performing for the first time in over    years...</p>
<p>Quilloughby and the Snuffs.</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>This is it...</p>
<p>the real you!</p>
<p>(GIGGLES)</p>
<p>Oh, dear God, no!</p>
<p>I look like bloody Churchill!</p>
<p>(AUDIENCE CHEERING)</p>
<p>Shut your gobs, you w*nk*r!</p>
<p>(GASPING)</p>
<p>Woo-hoo!</p>
<p>w*nk*r!</p>
<p>Can't you see this show is just a cash grab?</p>
<p>I'm only here because I lost my fortune suing people for saying things about me that were completely true.</p>
<p>(BOOING)</p>
<p>Is this what I turned into?</p>
<p>I'm greedy, I'm hateful, and my face looks like a syphilitic moon.</p>
<p>Well, it's not your fault you got old.</p>
<p>Sting is old.</p>
<p>Old Sting's bloody gorgeous, and he knows it.</p>
<p>(BOOING)</p>
<p>Oh, boo-hoo!</p>
<p>You can jeer while I enjoy this pastrami on rye.</p>
<p>(HORRIFIED GASPS)</p>
<p>But you're vegan!</p>
<p>I was,     until I found out veganism was invented by foreigners, of whom there are far too many on this planet!</p>
<p>(GASPING)</p>
<p>That's right, I hate the foreign!</p>
<p>Coming to this country and taking our jobs!</p>
<p>Sleeping with our men!</p>
<p>But you're a foreigner!</p>
<p>And you took the job of sad, washed-up rock star.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>You turned your back on veganism.</p>
<p>And you're also a huge r*cist.</p>
<p>♪ <em>Because everything is horrid except meat</em> ♪     ♪ <em>So slag off to you!</em> ♪  </p>
<p>(ANGRY SHOUTING)</p>
<p>Lisa, dear, don't let him happen to you.</p>
<p>Try not to sneer at everything.</p>
<p>And listen to others, at least a bit.</p>
<p>Perhaps one out of five times, but I can't tell you which times.</p>
<p>Thanks, Quilloughby.</p>
<p>You're the best imaginary friend a complicated eight-year-old could ever ask for.</p>
<p>(SIGHS)</p>
<p>But I think we both know it's time for you to go.</p>
<p>(SNIFFLES)</p>
<p>I'm going to miss you, you bloody w*nk*r.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, okay, I'm going to play a few songs off my new album.</p>
<p>It's entitled <em>Refugees?</p>
<p>Again?</em>   </p>
<p>(ANGRY SHOUTING)</p>
<p>(HORNS HONKING)</p>
<p>Stupid millennial traffic.</p>
<p><em>RADIO ANNOUNCER: This just in:</em> <em>a full-scale riot has broken out</em> <em>at the sh**t Festival.</em>   </p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>But Lisa's in there!</p>
<p>Who will save her?</p>
<p>Did someone call for a truck guy?</p>
<p>♪     (CHANTING): Misplaced anger!</p>
<p>Misplaced anger!</p>
<p>Somebody save me!</p>
<p>(ENGINE REVVING)</p>
<p>Torque, don't fail me now.</p>
<p>ALL: Truck, truck, hooray!</p>
<p>Truck, truck, hooray...</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>Homer. Homer. Homer, wake up.</p>
<p>He fell asleep while driving?</p>
<p>No, we got stuck in traffic and ran out of gas, so Dad ate a garbage bag full of Mom's PB&amp;Js and passed out.</p>
<p>Thanks for walking over and getting me.</p>
<p>Me and Trucky saved the day.</p>
<p>Sure you did, Homer.</p>
<p>Testosterone...</p>
<p>I don't know what came over me, Mom.</p>
<p>I was sullen, moody, thought everybody except me was an idiot...</p>
<p>Wait, is that what being a teenager is like?</p>
<p>Well, sometimes, sweetie.</p>
<p>Were you ever like that?</p>
<p>Blue mascara is who I am, Mom!</p>
<p>You're just jealous because you can't pull off hot pants.</p>
<p>For your information, I was going to break up with Homer.</p>
<p>But if you hate him, he must be great.</p>
<p>Honey, whatever phases you go through, I'll always be waiting for you on the other side of the slammed door.</p>
<p>- Mm. - Mm.</p>
<p>_     Shh.</p>
