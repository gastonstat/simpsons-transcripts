<p>  I'm not gonna let some stupid, nasty, homely woman...</p>
<p> (SHOUTING)</p>
<p> Simpson!</p>
<p> I concede.</p>
<p> Uh, congratulations.</p>
<p> (CHEERING, APPLAUSE)</p>
<p> Beloved superintendent of schools, Lisa Simpson, is now running for governor!</p>
<p> Soon she'll move beyond the scope of a career-stuck local anchorman like me.</p>
<p> (SPED-UP): This is Kent Brockman signing off.</p>
<p> Lisa Simpson, governor of...</p>
<p>(MUMBLES)</p>
<p> is running for president.</p>
<p> Not even her highly damaged relationship with her mother can stop her now.</p>
<p> Nate Silver analyzes.</p>
<p> Well, George, Lisa is doing great with disenchanted daughters.</p>
<p> Also tiger moms, checked-out dads and grandparents who like everything, plus middle children, nerds of all ages and saxophonists above second chair.</p>
<p> (SAXOPHONE PLAYS)</p>
<p> Now, it's a week before the election but...</p>
<p> what the hell...</p>
<p>I'm calling it for Lisa.</p>
<p> My work here is done.</p>
<p> Good luck, America.</p>
<p>It's  :   somewhere.</p>
<p> This just in.</p>
<p>Lisa Simpson has been elected the eighth president who did not go to college, joining George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Harry S. Truman.</p>
<p> Think about that when you're paying your student loans.</p>
<p> Stephanopoulos out.</p>
<p> My daughter really becomes president?</p>
<p>  Yes.</p>
<p>But you have to learn it on the streets.</p>
<p> (DRONES WHIRRING)</p>
<p> Great news about your daughter, Marge.</p>
<p> She's finally going to college?</p>
<p>  No.</p>
<p>She's president.</p>
<p> You knew that, didn't you?</p>
<p>  Oh, crap.</p>
<p>I really am out of the loop.</p>
<p> Look, the heart of the story is Lisa and me.</p>
<p> Do we finally get along?</p>
<p>  Also, in the future, how many more<em> Ghostbusters</em> do they make?</p>
<p>  Four.</p>
<p>The gay<em> Ghostbusters</em> is fantastic.</p>
<p> Can't we dwell on the fact that I was president?</p>
<p>  So concerned about your futures but no one cares about mine.</p>
<p> I won't get into details, but my body winds up in the dumpster behind the store.</p>
<p> Do any of you give a damn?</p>
<p>  (COUGHS)</p>
<p> Very well.</p>
<p> Now we have come to the final two cards.</p>
<p> The future will be revealed.</p>
<p> But first, I want to plug my gig this Saturday at the Comedy &amp; Magic Club.</p>
<p> I conjure the spirit of Rodney Dangerfield.</p>
<p> <em>Ich bekomme keinen Respekt.</em>    </p>
<p> I'm telling you.</p>
<p>- Ah.</p>
<p>Here we are.</p>
<p>- It's Inauguration Day, and Marge and Lisa are barely speaking.</p>
<p> And I promise you that, as your president, I will obsess over your welfare, because I don't have a life!</p>
<p> You're all I've got!</p>
<p> And I will serve you.</p>
<p> (CHEERING, WHOOPING)</p>
<p> (SCREECHES)</p>
<p> And we'll get right on that!</p>
<p> Madam President, just after you were sworn in, your predecessor finally conceded.</p>
<p> These transitional tantrums get longer and longer.</p>
<p> (WILHELM SCREAM IN DISTANCE)</p>
<p> Okay, he promised he'd leave after he did that.</p>
<p> But you're going to be a great president.</p>
<p> Thank you.</p>
<p> But maybe not a happy one.</p>
<p> Bart!</p>
<p>Oh, I almost hugged you.</p>
<p> Well, I almost wish you had.</p>
<p> Oh.</p>
<p>I think I will.</p>
<p> I hope you do.</p>
<p> (GRUNTS)</p>
<p> I know what you need.</p>
<p> Some President's Choice High Carumba.</p>
<p> Why did you bring that here?</p>
<p>  A: it's legal.</p>
<p> B: somehow still cool.</p>
<p> And C: you really need to chill out.</p>

<p>He's with me!</p>
<p> Oh, I got to tell you something.</p>
<p> Now that we're both grown and successful...</p>
<p> you, president, me, pot CEO and owner of three NBA teams...</p>
<p> I feel different.</p>
<p> I really, really, really don't hate you.</p>
<p> Aw.</p>
<p> Got anything to say to me?</p>
<p>  Um... yes.</p>
<p> All right.</p>
<p> I'll admit it.</p>
<p> I've always been kind of a pain in the butt.</p>
<p> Wow.</p>
<p>If you had said that earlier, even<em> I</em> would have voted for you.</p>
<p> - (DRONES WHIRRING)</p>
<p>- (APPLAUSE)</p>
<p> _     Wow, that's pretty cool for someone who was always unpopular.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p> But, but wait!</p>
<p> Not my fault.</p>
<p>Because, I don't know if you know, but I did not come from a family that made things easy.</p>
<p> Well, maybe you didn't make things easier for them either.</p>
<p> Maybe Mom was the one who was helping you in ways you don't even remember.</p>

<p> Took    minutes.</p>
<p> I'm here to see if you'll finally admit you'd be better off if you'd gone to college.</p>
<p> Are you crazy?</p>
<p> You still can't admit you were wrong.</p>
<p> Let me tell you something, lady.</p>
<p> Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Just-just wait a minute.</p>
<p> I'm president now.</p>
<p> I have a lot of resources.</p>
<p> Where's my mom translator?</p>
<p>  Maybe I started off on the wrong foot.</p>
<p> &quot;You constantly let me down.&quot;  </p>
<p> Of course, I appreciate everything you're saying.</p>
<p> &quot;You were never really in my corner.&quot;  </p>
<p> I may have said a lot of things in anger.</p>
<p> &quot;I meant what I said and I will stick to it.</p>
<p> But no matter what, I was always proud of you.&quot;  </p>
<p> You made me mad, too.</p>
<p> &quot;I was hurt because I care so much.  </p>
<p> All the respect and love I have for people came from you.&quot; </p>
<p> That's nice to hear.  </p>
<p> (CHOKED UP): &quot;I love you so much.&quot;   </p>
<p> (SOBBING SOFTLY)</p>
<p> &quot;I love you, too.&quot;   </p>

<p>- Oh, oh.</p>
<p> (SNIFFLES)</p>
<p>Okay, you can go now.</p>
<p> &quot;This translator is fantastic.</p>
<p> Give her a raise.&quot;   </p>

<p> - (&quot;DANCE OF THE SUGAR PLUM FAIRY&quot; PLAYS)</p>
<p>- _     Okay.</p>
<p>I enjoyed that story, but I got to know, how much is really true?</p>
<p> Let me consult the oracle.</p>
<p> Okay, Lisa, I'll give it to you straight.</p>
<p> You've got a   % chance of going to college, % Ivy League, % chance of a boyfriend, % chance of a girlfriend.</p>
<p> Oh!</p>
<p> (CHUCKLES): I like those odds!</p>
<p> Hey, can I get the game on this?</p>
<p> It's not a TV.</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
