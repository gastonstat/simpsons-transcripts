							<p>Oh, that stump is really eating into my tractor budget.</p>
<p>I'll have to use me expl*sives.</p>
<p>expl*sives? Great.</p>
<p>If we put charges on the load-bearing walls, we can blow up detention hall while leaving the art room unharmed.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Hey, I like art, okay?</p>
<p>I'm blowing up the stump, not the school.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>You never saw that.</p>
<p>Well done, boy.</p>
<p>Wait, here comes the &quot;mykeeyah&quot;.</p>
<p>What's a mykeeyah?</p>
<p>My Kia!</p>
<p>I'm laughing to fit in, but I still don't get it.</p>
<p>Miss Hoover, what's our lesson today?</p>
<p>Is it school?</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know. Let's see.</p>
<p>Family trees.</p>
<p>Who here knows what a family tree is?</p>
<p>Oh, family trees... the charts representing genealogical relationships in a branching structure.</p>
<p>Very good, Lisa.</p>
<p>Class, your assignment over the weekend will be to make your own family tree, emphasizing any notable or distinguished ancestors.</p>
<p>I can't wait to see what noble branches lie in the Simpson family foliage.</p>
<p>No, this can't be right.</p>
<p>Yech, they're all horrible.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Simpson family is a long line of horse thieves, b*at, horse b*at, dead thieves, and even a few... alcoholics.</p>
<p>There must have been some good ancestors.</p>
<p>Grampa, don't you know any?</p>
<p>Not a one.</p>
<p>Maybe the nicest was Abigail Simpson, who you know as the Pittsburgh Poisoner.</p>
<p>Listen, Lisa, you're going to find more than you bargained for.</p>
<p>If I were you, I wouldn't dig into the past.</p>
<p>I lived in some of that past, and I got out for a reason.</p>
<p>I won't give up. I have to know that somewhere in the muck and the mire and the Pittsburgh Poisoners, this family had a noble spark, and I will find it, even if I have to go back to Adam and Eve.</p>
<p>Oh, you mean Adam and Eve Simpson, or as you may know them, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.</p>
<p>Ooh! Whoa!</p>
<p>Well, are you going to help me or what?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>So, what are you looking for?</p>
<p>Family records for a school project on genealogical...</p>
<p>Hey, that's great.</p>
<p>Hey, Dad's idea pad.</p>

<p>So dusty.</p>
<p>The &quot;Diary of Eliza Simpson&quot;?</p>
<p>This entry is dated April 14, 1860.</p>
<p>I warn you: I don't know what's in there, but if it's about a Simpson, you ain't gonna be proud.</p>
<p>Our ancestors were kicked out of Australia.</p>
<p>Oh, stop.</p>
<p>It's the journal of a sweet little girl.</p>
<p>Keep reading, honey.</p>
<p>&quot;Dearest diary, today I am the happiest girl in Springfield...&quot;</p>
<p>See, all good.</p>
<p>&quot;...because tomorrow I shall get my very first slave.&quot;</p>
<p>I can't believe we're descended from slave owners.</p>
<p>Me neither.</p>
<p>For once, the Simpsons were in management.</p>
<p>Homer.</p>
<p>Oh, read a little more, honey.</p>
<p>&quot;Saturday, April 14, 1860.</p>
<p>Dear Diary, I must be brief, for tonight is the grand ball at Colonel Burns's plantation.&quot;</p>
<p>I shall dress myself in finery, like a well-to-do Southern belle.</p>
<p>What's for dinner?</p>
<p>Possum.</p>
<p>Oh, can't we have opossum?</p>
<p>Not on your salary.</p>
<p>I can't believe I buttoned my britches for this.</p>
<p>In my elegant gown, no one will suspect that I'm actually on a mission to help my very first slave escape to freedom.</p>
<p>Yes! She wasn't a slave owner.</p>
<p>Our family was on the Underground Railroad.</p>
<p>We ran a subway station?</p>
<p>No, the Underground Railroad was a bunch of people who helped slaves escape to Canada.</p>
<p>There were no actual trains and it wasn't under ground.</p>
<p>Then they should've called it the Aboveground Normal-Road.</p>
<p>Good point, Bart.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Hadn't thought of that before.</p>
<p>Very good, Bart.</p>
<p>That's a great story, Lisa!</p>
<p>And you should stop reading right there.</p>
<p>Wh... What are you doing?</p>
<p>I want to know what happens next.</p>
<p>Well, I don't.</p>
<p>The motto of the Simpsons is: &quot;Quit while you're ahead.&quot;</p>
<p>I made it into a sampler.</p>
<p>It's like when your father and I left the movie Carrie right after she was crowned prom queen.</p>
<p>She was so happy.</p>
<p>She had a lot of problems, but they were all behind her.</p>
<p>But, but, but... but... but...</p>
<p>Time for bed, sweetie.</p>
<p>Lisa. Lisa, it's me.</p>
<p>Eliza, the one good Simpson.</p>
<p>I've got so much more to tell you.</p>
<p>I must know.</p>
<p>You still reading that thing?</p>
<p>I'm warning you: when something goes into that vent, it shouldn't come out...</p>
<p>ever.</p>
<p>Well, I am reading it, and when I'm finished, I'm going to use Eliza's diary for my &quot;Black History Month&quot; presentation.</p>
<p>Ooh, good idea.</p>
<p>Bart, what are you doing for Black History Month?</p>
<p>I got an idea: you can march to Selma, and tell her she's ugly!</p>
<p>Listen. &quot;April 20, 1860.</p>
<p>A week ago, I had no idea what the future would bring, which, I guess, is always true of everyone all the time.</p>
<p>Anyway, last Saturday night, I went to Colonel Burns's ball.&quot;</p>
<p>I don't like this new Viennese dance craze, &quot;the waltz&quot;.</p>
<p>One, two, three, one, two, three...</p>
<p>Where's the &quot;four&quot;? All music needs a four!</p>
<p>I'll have the orchestra adjust its time signature, sir.</p>
<p>See that you do.</p>
<p>In the confusion, I slipped out of the ball and made my way to the stables, where I was to meet Mr. Burns's slave, Virgil.</p>
<p>But when I got to the stables, he was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Virgil?</p>
<p>Virgil, let's go.</p>
<p>You look like you could use a little help.</p>
<p>Actually, I'm here to help you.</p>
<p>Follow me north to freedom.</p>
<p>I don't think so.</p>
<p>Why? Because I'm young and I'm a woman?</p>
<p>No, because you're pointing south.</p>
<p>Oh, right, right. Sorry.</p>
<p>It's my first time.</p>
<p>That's all right. It's my 14th.</p>
<p>As we made our way northward, a couple of patrollers spotted us.</p>
<p>Well, well, well.</p>
<p>Where do you think you're going?</p>
<p>Run!</p>
<p>After them!</p>
<p>Obviously.</p>
<p>Well, you didn't say it.</p>
<p>Hearts pounding, we fled into the woods, but their horses were fast.</p>
<p>Escape seemed impossible.</p>
<p>What happened next?</p>
<p>Uh, bu... That's all there is.</p>
<p>The rest of the diary has turned to dust.</p>
<p>Oh! I'll never know if Eliza got Virgil safely to freedom.</p>
<p>Cheer up, sweetie.</p>
<p>Maybe we can find the answer in the library.</p>
<p>To the reference desk!</p>
<p>The library?</p>
<p>Bart, can you believe we're married to those nerds?</p>
<p>There are no books about an Eliza Simpson, but I did find this.</p>
<p>Ooh, a cookbook.</p>
<p>That's Eliza's mother!</p>
<p>Martha, you are the best!</p>
<p>&quot;Pork Butt in Cream&quot;, &quot;Snout-Fried Neck&quot;, &quot;Frog-Haunch&quot;, &quot;Hooves Au Jus&quot;, &quot;Possum Pouch Pie&quot;...</p>
<p>Please don't make those recipes.</p>
<p>This one doesn't sound k*ll.</p>
<p>And it comes with a story.</p>
<p>&quot;Many years ago, my daughter, Eliza, brought a runaway slave, Virgil, to the house.&quot;</p>
<p>They made it back to the house?! How?</p>
<p>The patrollers were too fast for Eliza and Virgil.</p>
<p>Luckily, they chanced upon a traveling circus...</p>
<p>...where they were helped by a crusty, old clown.</p>
<p>A little schmutz, a little schmear, and presto!</p>
<p>You're part of the under-clown railroad.</p>
<p>So, you got any talent?</p>
<p>Well, I am a bit musical.</p>

<p>Rule number one: never be better than me.</p>
<p>And I'm pretty bad.</p>
<p>Nothing to see here... just a couple of clowns, and the world's youngest bearded lady.</p>
<p>That I is.</p>
<p>Look at her any longer, you're gonna have to pay a nickel.</p>
<p>Why do I always ask for a nickel?</p>
<p>That's like 20 bucks in 2010 money.</p>
<p>Wait! All that was in the recipe?</p>
<p>It was a footnote. See?</p>
<p>&quot;Anyway, I was very proud of Eliza, but my husband Hiram had not quite caught abolition fever.&quot;</p>
<p>Uh-uh, no way.</p>
<p>He'll get me in trouble.</p>
<p>Maybe you'll change your mind about me after you try some of my wheel cakes.</p>
<p>Wheel cakes?</p>
<p>They're just honey-sweetened batter...</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>...deep-fried in hog lard.</p>
<p>Lard, you say.</p>
<p>Then dusted with powdered sugar.</p>
<p>You can stay.</p>
<p>You swear you'll help him?</p>
<p>I give you my word as a Southern gentleman.</p>
<p>Whoo!</p>
<p>So they did the right thing.</p>
<p>My quest is fulfilled.</p>
<p>Our family has heroes!</p>
<p>Shh.</p>
<p>Our family has heroes.</p>
<p>Martin Luther King had a dream.</p>
<p>Dreams are where Elmo and Toy Story had a party and I went there.</p>
<p>Yay. My turn is over.</p>
<p>One of your best, Ralph.</p>
<p>Next up, we have Simpson, L.</p>
<p>My Black History Month presentation is called &quot;The Simpsons: The First Family of Freedom.&quot;</p>
<p>No, no, no, not now! Quit, quit!</p>
<p>No, don't quit the program, just the update, you stupid...</p>
<p>Computers, right?</p>
<p>Our story begins with a spunky little spitfire named Eliza Simpson.</p>
<p>The year was 1860, and the Underground Railroad was... though Hiram, Mabel, and Eliza are no longer among us, their truth goes marching on.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Bravo, Lisa.</p>
<p>Very entertaining, but then again, fairy tales always are.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>I hold in my hand another diary.</p>
<p>That of my great-great-great... great-great grandfafa, Milford van Houten.</p>
<p>&quot;April 22nd, 1860...</p>
<p>I was reclining beneath a sarsaparilla tree, reading about one of Mr. Thomas Jefferson's marvelous inventions.</p>
<p>when suddenly I heard quite a commotion coming from the Simpson residence.&quot;</p>
<p>You're lying!</p>
<p>Leave me alone! I have sells to crop.</p>
<p>That's one of Virgil's sugar-sprinkled cake rings.</p>
<p>Now, where is he?</p>
<p>I don't have to answer to some weak old man with a walking stick.</p>
<p>Ahh! A b*at stick!</p>
<p>Brigand.</p>
<p>Dastard.</p>
<p>Renegade.</p>
<p>Mooncalf.</p>
<p>I can't tell you where he is... I swore an oath.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>You know, Simpson, every man has his price.</p>
<p>No one is better at determining said price than yours truly.</p>
<p>I would say your price is... a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>That's exactly my price.</p>
<p>Your man Virgil is... in...</p>
<p>Father, no!</p>
<p>Eliza, hold your tongue!</p>
<p>Don't worry, I'll handle this one.</p>
<p>Young lady, in this day and age, women only express their opinions in diaries to be found long after they're gone.</p>
<p>From the day you were born, you were brought up to crave the approval of a man.</p>
<p>And I know you really want to be a good girl, and good girls are seen and not heard.</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p>That-a-girl.</p>
<p>Now, where's my man?</p>
<p>In the turnip shed.</p>
<p>Now, what's my surprise?</p>
<p>Your surprise is a new pair of shoes.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, that surprise is so pleasant.</p>
<p>&quot;After that fateful day, I could never even look at Eliza again.&quot;</p>
<p>It didn't help that the next day, he drank bad well water and went blind.</p>
<p>No! You lie!</p>
<p>Eliza Simpson can't be a coward.</p>
<p>She's the only decent ancestor I have.</p>
<p>Ach. Take it outside, lassie.</p>
<p>We've still got three &quot;Jackie Robinsons&quot; and a &quot;Tuskegee Airmen&quot; to go.</p>
<p>And so many Obamas.</p>
<p>Yes, we can.</p>
<p>Audacity of hope.</p>
<p>Let me be clear.</p>
<p>As I told you, we don't have any books pertaining to Eliza Simpson.</p>
<p>But I need to prove that my ancestor couldn't have backed down to Colonel Burns.</p>
<p>Colonel Burns?</p>
<p>Why, I haven't heard my father's name in years.</p>
<p>You know, you could try our film vault.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>We have a film vault?</p>
<p>It's where we hooked up during the Christmas party.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>So, Miss Eliza, I understand you just turned 100.</p>
<p>It's been quite a life.</p>
<p>Any regrets?</p>
<p>Just one.</p>
<p>When I was a girl, I witnessed a grave injustice, but I held my tongue.</p>
<p>That pat on my head from a wicked man has haunted me to this day.</p>
<p>There's no noble Simpson.</p>
<p>Oh, you were right, Dad.</p>
<p>I should have quit while I was ahead instead of learning the horrible truth about our family and Virgil.</p>
<p>Aw, don't cry, meat pie.</p>
<p>Things worked out pretty well for Virgil in the end.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Is there something you know about Virgil that you haven't told us?</p>
<p>I'll take that secret to my grave... or urn, or medical school dissecting table, or wherever you're dumping me.</p>
<p>Listen, Wrinkles, if you know something that'll cheer up my little girl, you'd better spill it.</p>
<p>Or I can make things very uncomfortable for you.</p>
<p>That enough?</p>
<p>Ah! Okay, I'll talk.</p>
<p>D-Day is June 6th. Repeat, June 6th.</p>
<p>Allied forces will land on the beaches of Normandy in the following order: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno.</p>
<p>Are you writing this down, Fritz?</p>
<p>About Virgil.</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>Well, Lisa, Mabel knew her husband well, so she had cooked up a little payback pie.</p>
<p>Get off my property, Colonel Burns.</p>
<p>And if I ever see you in these parts again... you're gonna be a Memphis belle.</p>
<p>Very well. You may have won this round, but someday my history will be told by my descendants Ken and Ric Burns.</p>
<p>I knew you'd break your promise.</p>
<p>Now I'm taking Virgil to freedom.</p>
<p>You defied your husband for me?</p>
<p>Man, this is the '60s.</p>
<p>Now let's take you to a place where a black man can blend in: Canada.</p>
<p>So, with those words, Mabel and Virgil headed north, but their journey was fraught with peril.</p>
<p>Hmm...</p>
<p>Mabel, why don't I go on alone, and you go back to Hiram?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>There's no life for me with him.</p>
<p>I just need to disguise my hair.</p>
<p>But how?</p>
<p>May I be of assistance?</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln?!</p>
<p>Perhaps this hat will help disguise your hair.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>How's it look?</p>
<p>It makes you look like a potbellied stove.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, &quot;Honest Abe&quot;.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm a riot.</p>
<p>As the border drew close, so did Virgil and Mabel.</p>
<p>After you.</p>
<p>By the time they crossed into Canada, things had changed.</p>
<p>Mabel she divorced Hiram and got one of his shoes in the settlement.</p>
<p>Mabel and Virgil lived out the rest of their days in peace.</p>
<p>They got married, and since Virgil had no last name, they both took the name Simpson so that Mabel could keep all her monogrammed table linens.</p>
<p>And their son, Abraham Simpson, was my great-grandfather.</p>
<p>So you're actually descended from Virgil, not Hiram.</p>
<p>Are ya happy?</p>
<p>Yes. I'm thrilled.</p>
<p>We've regained our family honor, and we're 1/64th black.</p>
<p>So that's why I'm so cool.</p>
<p>That's why my jazz is so smooth.</p>
<p>And that's why I earn less than my white co-workers.</p>
<p>Grampa, why'd you try to keep us from finding this out?</p>
<p>Well, it's hard to explain this to a young person, but people of my generation are, you know...</p>
<p>r*cist?</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>I don't know what the big deal is.</p>
<p>I mean, it never bothered any of you that my father's French.</p>
<p>You know, Bouvier?</p>
<p>So that's why I love drinking so much.</p>
<p>I'm French, not you.</p>
<p><em>C'est la vie</em>, baby.</p>
