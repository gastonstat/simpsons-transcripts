<p><em>We now return to our 48-hour Itchy &amp; Scratchy diamond jubilee marathon-</em> celebrating 75 years of rib-tickling brutality...</p>
<p>and hilarious atrocities.[/i]</p>
<p>The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>If I ever stop loving violence, I want you to sh**t me.</p>
<p>Will do.</p>
<p>Tonight: A stowaway bear is terrorizing space shuttle astronauts.</p>
<p>But first a sneak peak at tomorrow's Itchy and Scratchy parade.</p>
<p>Hello, everybody. I'm here live on Main Street... where dedicated fans are already staking out the best seats for the big anniversary parade.</p>
<p>Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.</p>
<p><em>Bye, kids. On your way back pick up a six-pack ofbeer.</em></p>
<p>Bart, Lisa, it's 11:00 at night. Where do you think you're going?</p>
<p>Downtown.</p>
<p>We gotta get seats for the Itchy and Scratchy parade.</p>
<p>I won't have my children sitting alone on a cold, dangerous street all night.</p>
<p>Homer, you go too.</p>
<p>Oh! Why can't they just take the g*n?</p>
<p>Hey, the comic book store's still open.</p>
<p>Save our seats.</p>
<p>Will do.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Hey, sister, just give me a chance to get next to you.</p>
<p>Hey-y-y!</p>
<p>Hey, my threads, baby.</p>
<p><em>How come I've never seen that Itchy &amp; Scratchy before?</em></p>
<p>Perhaps because you are a prepubescent ignoramus.</p>
<p><em>This is a bootleg copy of Itchy &amp; Scratchy Meet Fritz the Cat.</em></p>
<p>Because of its frank depiction of sex and narcotic consumption... it is not for infantile intellects such as yours.</p>
<p>Now toodle-oo.</p>
<p>Cool. I'll give you 10 bucks for that.</p>
<p><em>Are you the creator of Hi and Lois? Because you are making me laugh.</em></p>
<p>That drawing is worth exactly $750 American.</p>
<p>It's valuable, huh?</p>
<p>Ooh, your powers of deduction are exceptional.</p>
<p>I simply can't allow you to waste them here... when there are so many crimes going unsolved at this very moment.</p>
<p>Go! Go, for the good of the city.</p>
<p>Loser.</p>
<p><em>Oh, nerts!</em></p>
<p>Which one's Itchy- the car?</p>
<p>The mouse.</p>
<p>Oh. I guess that's not him then.</p>
<p>Represented on this next float is Roger Myers Sr... who founded his company in 1921... and struck it big when he teamed up a mouse named Itchy with a cat named Scratchy.</p>
<p><em>Here we see him creating the two comical characters... out of thoughts he plucks from his head.</p>
<p>And that man waving from the front of the float...</em> is his son, Roger Myers Jr.</p>
<p>Oh, isn't this just the most fun you've ever had in your life, Dave?</p>
<p>Yes, Suzanne. It is.</p>
<p>Whoa! Whoa!</p>
<p>Oh, forget this. I'm outta here.</p>
<p><em>Yea, Bart.! Yea.!</p>
<p>And now the parade has entered Bumtown.!</p>
<p>Oh, it's all just so exciting, Dave.!</p>
<p>Certainly seems to be a poorly planned parade route.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</em></p>
<p>Hey, wait up!</p>
<p>Get outta Bumtown, ya no-talent bum!</p>
<p>Show some respect, man. That &quot;no-talent&quot; created Itchy and Scratchy.</p>
<p>He didn't create Itchy. I did.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>He stole the character from me in 1928.</p>
<p>When I complained, his thugs kicked me out of his office and dropped an anvil on me.</p>
<p>Luckily I was carrying an umbrella at the time.</p>
<p><em>You invented Itchy- the Itchy &amp; Scratchy Itchy?</em></p>
<p>Sure. In fact, I invented the whole concept of cartoon violence.</p>
<p>Before I came along, all cartoon animals did was play the ukulele. I changed all that.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not callin' you a liar, but- but I can't think of a way to finish that sentence.</p>
<p>So I'm a liar, am I?</p>
<p><em>&quot;Itchy the Lucky Mouse in Manhattan Madness. &quot;</em></p>
<p>That's the first Itchy cartoon ever made. And it was made by me, ChesterJ. Lampwick.</p>
<p>Find me a 90-year-old projector and I'll prove it to you.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Itchy runs afoul of an lrishman.&quot;</p>
<p>Look out, Itchy.! He's lrish.!</p>
<p>Come on, Itchy. k*ll him.! k*ll that guy.!</p>
<p>&quot;A chance for more mis&quot;-</p>
<p>Look at that fat oaf.</p>
<p>Shh.! That's Teddy Roosevelt.</p>
<p>All right, Chester.! Woo.!</p>
<p>Way to go.!</em></p>
<p>I can't believe it. That was Itchy all right. You did invent him.</p>
<p>When people see this, you'll be rich and famous.</p>
<p>D'oh.</p>
<p>That was a nice film I had once. Last time I try to impress a four-year-old.</p>
<p>Well, see ya, kid.</p>
<p>You can't just go back to the gutter. You created Itchy. You should be a millionaire.</p>
<p>Ah, Roger Myers wouldn't give me a cent in the '20s.</p>
<p>Why would he give me anything now?</p>
<p><em>You asked Roger Myers Sr. for money. Roger Myers Jr. 's in charge of the studio now.</em></p>
<p>He's a good man. Every Christmas he goes down to the pound... and rescues one cat and one mouse and gives them to a hungry family.</p>
<p>Hmm, studio's closed until Tuesday. Animators have A.A. on Monday.</p>
<p>Hmm. Well, you can stay at my house until then.</p>
<p>My parents won't mind because they won't even know about it.</p>
<p>All right. The coast is clear.</p>
<p>There's a box you can sleep in.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Just move that cot outta the way.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do you know what radon is?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Good night.</p>
<p><em>Spare change?</em></p>
<p>Mom, there's a weird smell and a lot of cursing... coming from the basement, and Dad's upstairs.</p>
<p><em>Oh, it's just Bart and a mysterious stranger.</em></p>
<p>He's not a regular bum, Mom. He's a genius bum.</p>
<p>He created Itchy, and he's the father of cartoon violence.</p>
<p>He just needs to stay here till tomorrow.</p>
<p>We're goin' down to Itchy &amp; Scratchy Studios to pick up his check.</p>
<p>We're goin' down to Itchy &amp; Scratchy Studios to pick up his check.</p>
<p>Well, if it's just for one more night.</p>
<p><em>So, let's review:</em></p>
<p>You two screwballs have just strolled in here fresh from the sewer... and given me a bunch of bulldink about creating Itchy-with no proof at all- and you expect me to give you... how much?</p>
<p>$800 billion.</p>
<p>Well, that brought back a lot of memories.</p>
<p>All right, gentlemen, I'll take your case.</p>
<p>But I'm going to have to ask for a thousand-dollar retainer.</p>
<p>A thousand dollars? But your ad says, &quot;No money down.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, they got this all screwed up.</p>
<p>So you don't work on a contingency basis?</p>
<p>No, money down! Oops.</p>
<p>I shouldn't have this Bar Association logo here either.</p>
<p>Hey, Dad, can I have a thousand dollars?</p>
<p>All right. Wait. For what?</p>
<p>To pay for a lawyer for my bum.</p>
<p>Forget it.</p>
<p>I thought I recognized you.</p>
<p>I gave you a plate of corn muffins back in 1947 to paint my chicken coop.</p>
<p>And you never did it!</p>
<p>Those corn muffins were lousy.</p>
<p>Paint my chicken coop!</p>
<p>Make me!</p>
<p>That does it. One of them has to go.</p>
<p>Okay. Grandpa.</p>
<p>No, the B-U-M.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p><em>Wait. There's an easy way to get rid of Chester...</em> without the guilt of sending him back to the gutter.</p>
<p>And all it will cost you is a thousand dollars.</p>
<p><em>Exhibit A: Steamboat Itchy, dated 1928.</em></p>
<p>The very first Itchy and Scratchy cartoon. And the credits clearly state...</p>
<p>&quot;Written, directed and created by Roger Myers.</p>
<p>&quot;Music by Roger Myers and George Gershwin.</p>
<p>&quot;Produced by Roger Myers and Joseph P. Kennedy.</p>
<p><em>Copyright 1928 by Roger Myers. &quot;</em></p>
<p>You will also notice Mr. Myers's name and copyright notice... on the original drawings of the other members of the Itchy and Scratchy family: Brown-Nose Bear, Disgruntled Goat...</p>
<p>Flatulent Fox, Rich Uncle Skeleton... and Dinner Dog.</p>
<p>My client's film predates all of those things, Your Honor.</p>
<p>Oh, yes! I've forgotten... your famous film- the one you destroyed before the trial and haven't been able to find another copy of.</p>
<p><em>Oh, yes. That film.</em></p>
<p>Yes. You don't have a copy, do you?</p>
<p>Krusty, have you ever seen this so-called animation genius before?</p>
<p>Yes, I have.</p>
<p>You have?</p>
<p>I gave him a couple of blintzes to paint my fence... but he never did it!</p>
<p>Those blintzes were terrible.</p>
<p>Paint my fence!</p>
<p>Make me.</p>
<p><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content"><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle transcripts-topic-in-post" style="display:inline-block" data-full-width-responsive="true" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3808023418243141" data-ad-slot="1728561479"></ins>
<p><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div></p>
<p>You give me back those blintzes then!</p>
<p>Order! Order! We don't care about your blintzes.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Lampwick, when Roger Myers stole your character-</p>
<p>Objection.</p>
<p>Sustained.</p>
<p>If I hear &quot;objection&quot; and &quot;sustained&quot;... one more time today, I think I'm going to scream.</p>
<p>Objection.</p>
<p>Sustained.</p>
<p>Roger Myers didn't create any of his characters.</p>
<p>He stole them all.</p>
<p>Stole them all? That could turn this whole case around.</p>
<p>The only characters Myers could ever come up with were pathetic stick figures... with the words &quot;Sarcastic Horse&quot; and &quot;Manic Mailman&quot; printed on 'em.</p>
<p>And they t*nk! So he started stealing other people's characters.</p>
<p>That's a lie!</p>
<p>Are you saying- under oath, Mr. Myers- that your father didn't steal any of the characters associated with your studio?</p>
<p>Well, I don't think I am under oath, but yes, my father created them all.</p>
<p>Except for Flatulent Fox. That was based on a true story.</p>
<p>But he did create Itchy. That's one thing I am sure of.</p>
<p>Mr. Hutz, we've been in here for four hours. Do you have any evidence at all?</p>
<p>Well, Your Honor, we've got plenty of hearsay and conjecture.</p>
<p>Those are... kinds of evidence.</p>
<p>Your Honor, I move for dismissal.</p>
<p>I've got it! Dad, give me $750.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Keep the trial going. I'll be right back.</p>
<p>Your Honor, I'd like to call all of my surprise witnesses again.</p>
<p><em>Oh, there they are.</p>
<p>Oh, they were my favorites.</p>
<p>Thank you.</em></p>
<p>I knew I had seen this exact scene somewhere else.</p>
<p>It was in the movie Mr. Lampwick showed me.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this drawing was made in 1919- nine years before Roger Myers made his first Itchy and Scratchy cartoon.</p>
<p>That could have been drawn by anyone at anytime, Your Honor. There's no signature or date.</p>
<p>Look under the frame, Brad.</p>
<p>Careful. Careful. Whoops.</p>
<p>It's there!</p>
<p>Hmm. &quot;To Roger Myers. Keep drawing.</p>
<p>&quot;Your moxie more than makes up for your lack of talent.</p>
<p>Your pal, ChesterJ. Lampwick. September 3, 1919.&quot;</p>
<p>Okay. Maybe my dad did steal Itchy.</p>
<p>But so what? Animation is built on plagiarism.</p>
<p><em>If it weren't for someone plagiarizing The Honeymooners... we wouldn't have The Flintstones.</p>
<p>If someone hadn't ripped off Sergeant Bilko, there'd be no Top Cat.</em></p>
<p>Huckleberry Hound? Chief Wiggum? Yogi Bear? Ha!</p>
<p>Andy Griffith. Edward G. Robinson. Art Carney.</p>
<p>Your Honor, you take away our right to steal ideas... where are they gonna come from- her?</p>
<p>Uh- hmm-</p>
<p>How 'bout... Ghost Mutt?</p>
<p>The court rules in favor of Mr. Lampwick.</p>
<p>Itchy &amp; Scratchy Studios will pay a restitution of $800 billion.</p>
<p>Though that amount will probably come down a bit on appeal.</p>
<p>I hope you're happy, kid. The studio's bankrupt.</p>
<p>You just k*ll Itchy and Scratchy.</p>
<p>We k*ll Itchy and Scratchy?</p>
<p>Good riddance. Wanna go celebrate?</p>
<p>I feel like liver and onions.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>What are you gonna do with all your money, Mr. Lampwick?</p>
<p>Well, first off, here's your thousand dollars back for hiring that lawyer... and $750 for the drawing... and here's a couple of bucks for your trouble.</p>
<p>Whoo-hoo! Look, Marge. A couple of bucks!</p>
<p>As for the rest of it, I'm gonna buy the one thing I've been dreaming of... all the years I spent in the gutter: a solid gold house.</p>
<p>Well, Itchy and Scratchy are gone, but here's a cartoon that tries to make learning fun!</p>
<p>Heh-heh-ho-ho-</p>
<p>Sorry about this, kids. But stay tuned.</p>
<p>We got some real good toy commercials comin' right up. I swear.</p>
<p><em>Hey, who left all this garbage on the steps of Congress?</em></p>
<p>I'm not garbage.</p>
<p>I'm an amendment to be Yes, an amendment to be.</p>
<p>And I'm hopin' that they'll ratify me <em>There's a lot offlag burners.</p>
<p>Who have got too much freedom.</p>
<p>I wanna make it legal for policemen to b*at 'em 'Cause there's limits to our liberties.</p>
<p>Least I hope and pray that there are</em></p>
<p>'Cause those liberal freaks go too far.</p>
<p>But why can't we just make a law against flag burning?</p>
<p><em>Because that law would be unconstitutional.</p>
<p>But if we change the Constitution-</p>
<p>Then we could make all sorts of crazy laws.!</em></p>
<p>Now you're catching on.</p>
<p>What the hell is this?</p>
<p>It's one of those campy, '70s throwbacks that appeals to Generation X'ers.</p>
<p>We need another Vietnam to thin out their ranks a little.</p>
<p>What if people say you're not good enough to be in the Constitution?</p>
<p>Then I'll crush all opposition to me.</p>
<p>And I'll make Ted Kennedy pay.</p>
<p>If he fights back I'll say that he's gay.</p>
<p>Good news, Amendment. They ratified ya.</p>
<p>You're in the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p><em>Oh, yeah! Door's open, boys.</em></p>
<p>Whoob-whoob-whoob-whoob.</p>
<p><em>So it's true. Some cartoons do encourage violence.</em></p>
<p>Ow! We gotta get Itchy and Scratchy back.</p>
<p>And soon!</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>You've got to make more Itchy and Scratchy cartoons.</p>
<p>The judge says it's okay as long as you pay Mr. Lampwick royalties.</p>
<p>Royalties? Ha!</p>
<p>I don't have the money to produce the cartoons. I lost everything.</p>
<p>I can't even keep my dad's head in the freakin' cryogenic center anymore.</p>
<p>Ya comfortable in there, Daddy?</p>
<p>Look, if money's the only problem, I know a guy who has lots of it.</p>
<p>Shoe shine, sir? Comb your hair for ya? Sir?</p>
<p>Humph.</p>
<p>Sir? Sir? Sir?</p>
<p>Okay. Catch you on the way back.</p>
<p>Oh, hi, kids.</p>
<p>Hi, Chester.</p>
<p>Listen. Would you pay to make more Itchy and Scratchy cartoons?</p>
<p>You'll get more royalties.</p>
<p>I don't need any more money.</p>
<p>I'm not greedy. As long as I've got my health and my millions of dollars... and my gold house and my rocket car...</p>
<p>I don't need anything else.</p>
<p>Yes, but-</p>
<p>Not interested.</p>
<p>Dad, can we have $183,000?</p>
<p>What for?</p>
<p>Lisa and I want to finance a series of animated cartoons.</p>
<p>Oh. Uh- Forget it!</p>
<p>Oh, no. I give up.</p>
<p>There's nothin' we can do.</p>
<p>Yeah. I agree.</p>
<p>You wanna start on tryin' to get Apu out of jail?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><em>Wait, kids. You can't give up on Itchy and Scratchy. You're always so good at these things.</em></p>
<p>Why, together you've reunited Krusty with his father... gotten Principal Skinner his job back... and helped Dr. Riviera perform open heart surgery on your father.</p>
<p>You've even foiled Sideshow Bob on five separate occasions, and he's an evil genius.</p>
<p>You're right, Mom. I'm sure if we put our minds to it we can solve this one too.</p>
<p>Bart, look at this!</p>
<p>What a perfect plan.</p>
<p>Now Roger Myers's hotel is just-</p>
<p>And, so, when no one could think of a plan to resurrect Itchy and Scratchy... a young boy- a wonderful, irrepressible young boy- took it on his own to solve the problem.</p>
<p>He discovered that the Postal Service's Mr. Zip... was just a rip-off of my father's stick figure character Manic Mailman.</p>
<p><em>So the government gave me a huge cash settlement...</em> and Itchy &amp; Scratchy Studios is back in business.</p>
<p>Thanks to you, Lester.</p>
<p>What the hell is going on?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>But it looks like you might have a little competition all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Thanks, everybody. But I couldn't have done all this... without the help of my brainy sister, Eliza.</p>
<p>I, too, owe many thanks to Lester and Eliza.</p>
<p>This is a great vindication for anybody who was ever taking a bath... went to get the paper, fell down and had the door slam behind them and the doorknob break off.</p>
<p>And I'd like to thank Lester for reuniting me with my estranged wife.</p>
<p>I never even heard about that.</p>
<p>I don't understand it.</p>
<p>We're always the ones who solve these problems.</p>
<p>I guess you don't need it now, but... we had a plan too.</p>
<p>Hey, great. Listen. Write it down and mail it to last week, when I might have cared.</p>
<p>I've got cartoons to make, kids.</p>
<p><em>And Scratchy Show</em></p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>You kids must be so happy.</p>
<p>Your cute little cartoon friends are back on the air.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, technically everything worked out all right, but-</p>
<p>But?</p>
<p>Well, I wasn't the one who solved the problem... and neither was Lisa.</p>
<p><em>There's something unsettling about that.</em></p>
<p>Shh!</p>
