That car is very special to me.    </p>
<p>When I was young, my father took me in it to...    </p>
<p>- Buy comic books?<br />
- No, not comic books.    </p>
<p>Everything in my life is not comic books, okay?    </p>
<p>We bought baseball cards.    </p>
<p>Look, we'll detail your car and fix your comic book.    </p>
<p>This is not about my car.<br />
It is about me getting respect.    </p>
<p>I want all the<em> Little Lulus</em> five dollars can buy.    </p>
<p>And make it snappy, Blobba the Hutt.    </p>
<p>Jabba is actually quite slim!<br />
For a Hutt.    </p>
<p>Just get the<em> Lulus.</em>    </p>
<p>Or I'll take my business to Build-A-Bear.    </p>
<p>Here you go. Five dollars' worth of<em> Little Lulus.</em>    </p>
<p>As for you, I am not budging.    </p>
<p>Like the door of Superman's Fortress of Solitude when the b*at tried to visit. Pure folly.    </p>
<p>That comic is noncanonical.    </p>
<p>The only thing noncanonical in my store is Snoopy dressed as Sgt. Rock for an ill-timed Vietnam w*r ad.    </p>
<p>I see. Well, I'm sorry to have bothered you.    </p>
<p>Yes, don't let the door hit you on the way out.    </p>
<p>No, seriously. It's just been painted.    </p>
<p>Oh. That's what being nice gets you.    </p>
<p>Mom, Dad, I think I found the answer on the Internet!    </p>
<p>Lisa, nothing good ever comes from YouTube.    </p>
<p>Except ducks eating watermelon.    </p>
<p>No, no. Sentencing mitigation videos.    </p>
<p>People have had their jail terms reduced, or even gotten off death row by producing slick video appeals to the judge.    </p>
<p>Finally, a way for rich people to bend the system their way.    </p>
<p>Mr. Burns got off the hook once by using a video directed by Guillermo del Toro.    </p>
<p>Hello, I am, uh, film director Guillermo del Toro.    </p>
<p>Uh, when I was a young boy, I fell in love with monsters.    </p>
<p><em>Frankenstein's monster, King Kong, Son of Kong,</em>    </p>
<p><em>Nosferatu, Godzilla, Mechagodzilla,</em>    </p>
<p><em>Godzilla's nephew Godzooky,</em>    </p>
<p><em>Mothra the caterpillar, Mothra the moth,</em>    </p>
<p><em>the Blob from</em> The Blob...    </p>
<p><em>and Godzilla's cousin, Sheldon Godzilla.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Lesser known but equally horrifying.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Monsters, yes. But they are capable of love.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Which brings us to Montgomery Burns.</em>    </p>
<p>Oh, hello.    </p>
<p>Did someone mention me?    </p>
<p><em>DEL TORO: From birth, he was not wanted.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Then came the real monsters:</em>    </p>
<p><em>the bullies that hated him just because he was wealthy.</em>    </p>
<p><em>And maybe he rubbed it in a little.</em>    </p>
<p><em>But no one knows the real Mr. Burns.</em>    </p>
<p><em>I love Señor Burns.</em>    </p>
<p>Who are you?    </p>
<p>He combines the ancient evil of Cthulhu with the trim physique of Slender Man.    </p>
<p>Señor Burns demonstrates that in all so-called monsters b*at a heart. Thank you for listening.    </p>
<p>And thank you, Georgia Film Commission, for the   % discount.    </p>
<p>I'll see you wherever free people congregate.    </p>
<p>Like the Yale Club.    </p>
<p><em>[ORCHESTRAL FANFARE]</em>    </p>
<p>Wow. Maybe I've been all wrong about evil.    </p>
<p>Once again, Mr. del Toro stripped away the darkness and found beauty at its core.    </p>
<p>Like that fish-snuggling movie.    </p>
<p>Excuse me.    </p>
<p>[COUGHS]    </p>
<p>Ah... you told me you've never been to Missouri.    </p>
<p>You're right, honey. Hollywood can solve anything.    </p>
<p>Except its own lack of creativity and diversity.    </p>
<p>Now, how do we make this thing?    </p>
<p>I think we should use a videographer.    </p>
<p>There's one left in town.    </p>
<p>I will do anything for your wedding video.    </p>
<p>Color, black and white, or Polaroid Swinger, cha cha cha.    </p>
<p>I gotta warn you, my camera hand is shaky because I have a major vitamin E deficiency.    </p>
<p><em>No problemo.</em> It works fine if you just nod your head like this...    </p>
<p>[WARBLING]    </p>
<p>You know, we could just do it ourselves.    </p>
<p>Yeah. Those are the words that are k*ll my profession.    </p>
<p>Now you say nice things about me.    </p>
<p>So what is it you're looking for?    </p>
<p>Words or something? Uh, human words?    </p>
<p>Okay, uh, Homer Simpson, uh, well, real family man.    </p>
<p>Yeah. Always brings his kids into the bar.    </p>
<p>Not one of them aristocrats who gets all bent out of shape when there's a mouse in his beer.    </p>
<p>Hey, Moe. I need you to file a serial number off a wheelchair.    </p>
<p>HOMER: Cut!    </p>
<p>Hmm... Homer Simpson?<br />
How can I put this?    </p>
<p>Ah, we've never had an employee get rehired so many times.    </p>
<p>Homer Simpson has two children enrolled in our school.    </p>
<p>That's all I'm comfortable saying.    </p>
<p>All right, let's see what you got.    </p>
<p>I had to edit a little.    </p>
<p><em>Homer Simpson. Family man.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Happy. Aristocrat.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Too. Cool. Comfortable.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Homer is a... grace to the family.</em>    </p>

<p>[SNOWBALL II MEOWS SADLY]    </p>
<p>Sorry, Snowball, cats are polarizing.    </p>
<p>[MEOWS SYMPATHETICALLY]    </p>
<p>[SIGHS] Please...just give us something we can use.    </p>
<p>We're ready.    </p>
<p>Oh, now the dog won't cooperate.    </p>
<p>There's a trick that always works with Kevin James.    </p>
<p>[PANTING]    </p>
<p>♪ <em>I think I'll color this man father...</em> ♪    </p>
<p><em>MARGE: He's a guy who gets off at  :  </em>    </p>
<p><em>and comes directly home to be with his kids.</em>    </p>
<p>♪ <em>Said I'm gonna color him father</em> ♪    </p>
<p>♪ <em>Color him father...</em> ♪    </p>
<p><em>He's incredibly generous to his friends and neighbors.</em>    </p>
<p><em>In his spare time, he loves PTA meetings.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Helping with the Cub Scouts.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Or just going to the movies.</em>    </p>
<p>This is Maggie, our baby.    </p>
<p>And she understands what's going on.    </p>
<p>She's never said a word, but I get the feeling she wants to say something now.    </p>
<p>Nee... Da... dy.    </p>
<p>What a man.    </p>
<p>And now we pray.    </p>
<p>Bless us, O Lord, for this bountiful feast...    </p>
<p>Not that prayer.    </p>
<p>I must say, I am impressed.    </p>
<p>So, unless the prosecution has a rebuttal, I'm inclined to...    </p>
<p>Not... so... fast.    </p>
<p>Do you have a video, too?    </p>
<p>No, that would be pretentious.    </p>
<p>- Very well, then.<br />
- I have a speech.    </p>
<p><em>[SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING]</em>    </p>
<p>Comic book sales is a very fragile field.    </p>
<p>Kids hate to read, the stores smell like farts    </p>
<p>- and bubble gum...<br />
- [MURMURING IN AGREEMENT]    </p>
<p>Then the things I cherish most... my father's car, my precious, precious comic, and most important, my dignity... were taken from me.    </p>
<p>I'm just your ordinary small businessman.    </p>
<p>Never took anything from anyone.    </p>
<p>But I did dare to think I would be treated with respect.    </p>
<p>I have so many fictional heroes, Your Honor.    </p>
<p>For once, please give me a real one.    </p>
<p>[GRUNTS]    </p>
<p>Best. Courtroom speech. Ever.    </p>
<p>Yes!    </p>
<p>I will render my sentence tomorrow.    </p>
<p>I thank you. Good night.    </p>
<p>Boom.    </p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait.<br />
Do you want to go to a movie?    </p>
<p>I'll go to a movie with you, Judge.    </p>
<p><em>- You</em> won't be available.<br />
- Oh.    </p>
<p>Dad, the computer says...    </p>
<p>That computer has brought me nothing but trouble and sports scores while I'm at church!    </p>
<p>A store in Ogdenville just put up the same<em> Radioactive Man</em> comic that we destroyed in perfect condition.    </p>
<p>It's my last hope at freedom.    </p>
<p>I mean, how much could an old comic cost?    </p>
<p>[WHISPERING]    </p>
<p>[WHISPERING]    </p>
<p>- Are you done?<br />
- No.    </p>
<p>[WHISPERING]    </p>
<p>[TIRES SCREECH]    </p>
<p>You can't be closed.<br />
It's Tuesday at  :  !    </p>
<p>Do you not see the &quot;closed&quot; sign written in Wakandan?    </p>
<p>And I wasted high school learning German.    </p>
<p><em>Was fur eine Schande!</em>    </p>
<p>Well, German is Earth's closest language to Klingon.    </p>
<p>Come on in.    </p>
<p>What do<em> you</em> want?    </p>
<p>I'm extremely busy.    </p>
<p>Mm-hmm.    </p>
<p>I want to talk to you.    </p>
<p>I see we have reached the epilogue of our little drama.    </p>
<p>[SCREAMS] No, not the epilogue. Still plot. Still plot!    </p>
<p>Look, I know we've had our differences, but we can still be friends.    </p>
<p>Like when Superman teamed up with Lex Luthor.    </p>
<p>That was an imaginary story written by Harlan Ellison because he wanted to get fired.    </p>
<p>Well, maybe<em> this</em> will tickle your ponytail.    </p>
<p>- [BOING]<br />
- [GASPS]    </p>
<p>The Ogdenville copy! It lives!    </p>
<p>Am I forgiven?    </p>
<p>I'm afraid not. No.    </p>
<p>I don't have a choice.<br />
The grudge is still inside me.    </p>
<p>Which is also the name of a low-budget Roger Corman movie.    </p>
<p>Oh! What does it take?    </p>
<p>How to explain what I am feeling.    </p>
<p>Uh... look around. What do you see?    </p>
<p>Uh... a bunch of stuff that other people threw out?    </p>
<p>Like a mirror, you see everything but understand nothing. Get out.    </p>
<p>[SIGHS] Let's go.    </p>
<p>Oh, my God! Oh!    </p>
<p>Is that a season one<em> Welcome Back, Kotter</em> key chain?    </p>
<p>It is! The proof... a John Travolta who is happy to be there!    </p>
<p>How did<em> you</em> get this?    </p>
<p><em>[APPLAUSE ON TV]</em>    </p>
<p><em>Did I ever tell you about my Uncle Max?</em>    </p>
<p><em>He was the halfback in the family.</em>    </p>
<p><em>If you gave him a sandwich, you got half back.</em>    </p>
<p><em>[ALL LAUGHING]</em>    </p>
<p>[GIGGLING]    </p>
<p>This is for you, son.    </p>
<p>Don't say I never gave you nothing.    </p>
<p>Are you gonna give me anything else?    </p>
<p>Nope. One thing.    </p>
<p>Homer, when you look at your precious totem there, how does it make<em> you</em> feel?    </p>
<p>I never thought of it before.    </p>
<p>I touch it all the time.    </p>
<p>I feel unhappy if I don't have it.    </p>
<p>Sometimes I dream about it.    </p>
<p>[GASPS] I think I love it!    </p>
<p>Well put. Now understand this.    </p>
<p>Dah!    </p>
<p>That is how<em> you</em> made<em> me</em> feel!    </p>
<p>[WHOOSHES]    </p>
<p>Now you see.    </p>
<p>And you may consider the charges dropped.    </p>
<p>Let us shake hands, drink rice wine, and enjoy Swedish Fish candy.    </p>
<p>Are you saying I'm off the hook?    </p>
<p>Yes. In fact, you may be surprised, but you are now my best friend.    </p>
<p>So I'm not going to prison?    </p>
<p>No, you are going to Comic-Con with me.    </p>
<p>Oh. Hmm.    </p>
<p>Let me see, let me see.    </p>
<p>Dad, just say yes.    </p>
<p>Is prison still an option?    </p>
<p>No. Not until you hold down Harrison Ford while I clip off his fingernails.    </p>
<p>- Let's get to it.<br />
- [GROANS]    </p>
<p>[SNORING]    </p>
<p>- What's this?<br />
- Mitigation video.    </p>
<p><em>When I first met Bart, I was just a nerdy kid with glasses.</em>    </p>
