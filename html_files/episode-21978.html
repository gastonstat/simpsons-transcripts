							<p>Homie the Clown.</p>
<p>When Krusty wants to, he can still blow them away.</p>
<p>Yes. He can take a simple, everyday thing like eating a bicycle... and make it funny.</p>
<p>See you tomorrow, kids.</p>
<p>But before I go, I'd just like to say...</p>
<p>There's nothing better than a cigarette... unless it's a cigarette lit with a $ 100 bill.</p>
<p>Put 5000 bucks on the Lakers. Hire Kenny G to play for me in the elevator.</p>
<p>My house is dirty. Buy me a clean one.</p>
<p>Krusty, as your accountant, I must warn you...</p>
<p>Did you send 1000 roses... to Bea Arthur's grave?</p>
<p>Yes. But she's...</p>
<p>I don't wanna hear the end of sentences.</p>
<p>George Carlin on three.</p>
<p>Yeah. Lawsuit? Oh, come on.</p>
<p>My &quot;Seven Words You Can't Say on TV&quot; bit... was entirely different from your bit.</p>
<p>So I'm a thief, am I? Well, excuse me!</p>
<p>Give him 10 grand.</p>
<p>Steve Martin on four.</p>
<p>Ten grand.</p>
<p>Krusty, in regards to the large wager you made on yesterday's horse race...</p>
<p>Come on. How about letting me go double or nothing on the opera tonight.</p>
<p>Who do you like?</p>
<p>The tenor.</p>
<p>Okay. But we're only letting the bet ride... because you crack us so consistently up.</p>
<p>You've got to stop blowing your money like this, Krusty.</p>
<p>No can do.</p>
<p>And those ridiculous bets you make.</p>
<p>Gambling is the finest thing a person can do if he's good at it.</p>
<p>You haven't won anything in months.</p>
<p>So I'll just make more money.</p>
<p>Crank out some merchandise.</p>
<p>You already merchandised everything.</p>
<p>Krusty's Monopoly game, the Krusty Crowd-Control Barrier.</p>
<p>Nothing is selling anymore. Not even your new Lady Krusty line.</p>
<p>But our infomercials are running 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>So, what do you think of the Lady Krusty Mustache-Removal System, Angelique?</p>
<p>It's Krusterrific, Johnny Unitas.</p>
<p>But is my upper lip supposed to bleed like this?</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>At this rate, you'll be broke in a month. Only thing left to do is... to open a clown college and train some regional Krustys.</p>
<p>You mean like that bozo, Bonko the Clown?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Forget it.</p>
<p>I'll just cut back on the condor-egg omelets.</p>
<p>A couple of those would be tasty right now.</p>
<p>I'll found the college tomorrow.</p>
<p>It must be the first of the month. New Billboard Day!</p>
<p>Finders, keepers.</p>
<p>&quot;This year, give her English muffins.&quot;</p>
<p>Whatever you say, Mr. Billboard.</p>
<p>&quot;Best in the West.&quot;</p>
<p>That rhymes.</p>
<p>Clown college. You can't eat that.</p>
<p>I got everything I was supposed to get.</p>
<p>I'm not going to enroll in that clown college, though.</p>
<p>That advertisement had no effect on me whatsoever.</p>
<p>Hey, Homer. The section you're supposed to be monitoring is on fire.</p>
<p>Clowns are funny.</p>
<p>Mom?</p>
<p>I think I'll have some wine.</p>
<p>Marge?</p>
<p>Yes, Homie.</p>
<p>That's it. You people have stood in my way long enough.</p>
<p>I'm going to clown college.</p>
<p>I don't think any of us expected him to say that.</p>
<p>Hurry up. It's my first day of clown college.</p>
<p>Hold still, Homer. Don't squirm.</p>
<p>I am holding still. I am squirming.</p>
<p>Dad, you can't go around pretending to be Krusty.</p>
<p>It's sacrilege. He's a one and only. I mean, he invented the pie fight... the pratfall and the seltzer bottle, as far as I know.</p>
<p>Yeah, Dad. It was bad enough when you tried to pass yourself off as Tom Bosley.</p>
<p>But Krusty...</p>
<p>You didn't complain when I got you... this close to Chachi.</p>
<p>What's a chachi?</p>
<p>All right. Now, there can only be one Krusty in each territory.</p>
<p>So I hope this works out. Tell me where you're from.</p>
<p>Georgia.</p>
<p>Texas.</p>
<p>Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Russia.</p>
<p>New Hampshire.</p>
<p>Homer.</p>
<p>Okay, we'll start off with the baggy p... Wha...?</p>
<p>Those are supposed to be baggy pants. Baggy!</p>
<p>I've never had a pair of pants that fit this well in my life.</p>
<p>Okay. Memorize these funny place names: Walla Walla, Keokuk, Cucamonga... Seattle.</p>
<p>Stop it. You're k*ll me.</p>
<p>Seattle.</p>
<p>And now, everybody's favorite, the Spin-Cycle Fantastic trick.</p>
<p>It's a great piece of buffoonery if you pull it off.</p>
<p>But if you blow it, you'll look like a fool.</p>
<p>Steady. Steady.</p>
<p>Now, when the wealthy dowager comes in, the party's over, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;k*ll wealthy dowager.&quot;</p>
<p>Burn that seat.</p>
<p>These Krusty-brand balloons are 3 bucks each.</p>
<p>Get a cheap one, and what happens? Goes off!</p>
<p>Takes out the eyeballs of every kid in the room. What's that gonna cost you?</p>
<p>Hey, Bill. What did that cost us?</p>
<p>I'm sorry I doubted you before, Dad.</p>
<p>If there has to be a bastardized version of Krusty, I'm glad it's you.</p>
<p>Thanks, honey. Bank sh*t!</p>
<p>That's good aim, Dad.</p>
<p>Well, it was my major.</p>
<p>Welcome to the noble family of k*ll Krustaceans.</p>
<p>You'll now go back to your hometowns and do kids' parties, swap meets... and the other piddling crap I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot clown pole.</p>
<p>Now come and get your catskins...</p>
<p>I mean, sheepskins.</p>
<p>This is the happiest day of my life...</p>
<p>Got it. No shock for me.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>And now, to help introduce our fantastic new burger, the one with ketchup... here he is, coming in by parachute, Krusty the Clown.</p>
<p>&quot;To audience. I now proclaim this new burger for sale.&quot;</p>
<p>Lord, save me.</p>
<p>It's the Krusty Burglar.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. He's stealing all the burgers.</p>
<p>Why, you little...</p>
<p>Homer. Homer, it's all just an act.</p>
<p>Stop. Stop.</p>
<p>He's already dead.</p>
<p>Sir. Sir.</p>
<p>I gotta get him.</p>
<p>Get him.</p>
<p>Krusty the Clown, everybody.</p>
<p>Please look at my MedicAlert bracelet.</p>
<p>Hey, hey.</p>
<p>And then take that and... put that in there and... here's your giraffe, little girl.</p>
<p>I'm a boy.</p>
<p>That's the spirit. Never give up.</p>
<p>Well, I guess you're pretty impressed, huh, Bart?</p>
<p>My dad got Krusty the Clown to personally appear at my party.</p>
<p>I have a feeling I could get him to appear at my house.</p>
<p>I don't know, Bart. My dad's a pretty big wheel down at the cracker factory.</p>
<p>It's not 5:30 yet.</p>
<p>Hey, nice threads.</p>
<p>I'm b*at.</p>
<p>And after work, I gotta dedicate a new Jiffy Lube and cohost the ACE Awards.</p>
<p>Wow, Jiffy Lube.</p>
<p>Boy, you're running yourself ragged.</p>
<p>Yeah. When I started this clown thing, I thought it would be nothing but glory.</p>
<p>You know, the glory of being a clown.</p>
<p>I tell you, it's hard, tiring work.</p>
<p>But when I see the smiles on their little faces... I just know they're getting ready to jab me with something.</p>
<p>Well, my time's almost up here. So I'd like to say I know Woody Allen.</p>
<p>And now, the winner for the most promising new series on cable: Old Starsky and Hutch's.</p>
<p>Accepting the award is the son of the guy who played Huggy Bear.</p>
<p>Let's walk and talk. I have wonderful stories about other famous people... that include me in some way.</p>
<p>Can't. Gotta distract bulls at a rodeo.</p>
<p>Hey, me too. We can go together.</p>
<p>No. I'm going a different way than you, Dick.</p>
<p>Your churlish attitude reminds me of the time I had dinner with Groucho and...</p>
<p>You're gonna have dinner with Groucho tonight if you don't b*at it.</p>
<p>Being a clown sucks. Kicked by kids, bit by dogs, and admired by the elderly.</p>
<p>Who am I clowning? I have no business being a clown.</p>
<p>I'm leaving the clowning business to the other clowns in the clowning business.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Well, well, well, velocity boy.</p>
<p>I'm gonna give you the biggest ticket you...</p>

<p>Hey, Krusty!</p>
<p>I'm not Krusty.</p>
<p>To think I was gonna give you a ticket.</p>
<p>Krusty the Clown.</p>
<p>I am not Krusty.</p>
<p>Hey, Krusty, Krusty. You remember the time we got loaded... and set those beavers loose in that pine-furniture store?</p>
<p>Memories. All right, you take it easy, Krusty.</p>
<p>Hey, he didn't give me a ticket.</p>
<p>This is an intriguing development.</p>
<p>You mean I get 5 percent off everything in the store just because I look like...</p>
<p>I mean, just because I am Krusty the Clown?</p>
<p>How could I charge full price to the man whose lust for filthy magazines... kept me in business during that first shaky year?</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, here is your new issue of Gigantic Asses.</p>
<p>I'm telling you, this'll work. They'll think I'm Krusty and give us free stuff.</p>
<p>I've been getting free stuff all day. Look at this swell bucket of house paint.</p>
<p>Look at it.</p>
<p>I'm not saying it won't work.</p>
<p>I'm just saying it's dishonest.</p>
<p>Lf we agree, then why are we arguing?</p>
<p>Hey, Krusty, hey. Beautiful date tonight, huh?</p>
<p>And such lovely children you have now.</p>
<p>I'm more striking than lovely.</p>
<p>You come with me. Come with Luigi.</p>
<p>You don't want to sit with the rest of the scum.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>I only consider you scum compared to Krusty.</p>
<p>Well, I can see that.</p>
<p>Yeah, you see how you scum.</p>
<p>Let me get this straight. You took money made franchising your name... and bet it against the Harlem Globetrotters?</p>
<p>Oh, I thought the Generals were due.</p>
<p>He's spinning the ball on his finger. Just take it. Take the ball.</p>
<p>That game was fixed. They were using a freaking ladder, for God's sake.</p>
<p>I am afraid the time has come for you to pay us.</p>
<p>Look, I'm cleaned out. Just take the clown college.</p>
<p>We have already taken it.</p>
<p>Kids have a lot of money these days.</p>
<p>So after you finish your performance, you might consider robbing them.</p>
<p>What can I tell you? You can't get bl*od from a turnip.</p>
<p>You wanna k*ll me, go ahead and k*ll me.</p>
<p>Hey, all right, okay already.</p>
<p>Look, we can talk this over.</p>
<p>No more talk.</p>
<p>It is time for us to take you for a ride.</p>
<p>Oh, no...</p>
<p>Mind if I go to the bathroom first?</p>
<p>I see no harm in that.</p>
<p>When he's done in there, I gotta go.</p>
<p>Okay, wherever Krusty's gone, we'll find him.</p>
<p>Legs, you check out the East Side. Louie, Rome and Budapest.</p>
<p>Tell the boys I want a total world search.</p>
<p>Right, boss.</p>
<p>Right, boss.</p>
<p>I want a free car because I'm Krusty. Krusty the Clown. Get it? Krusty.</p>
<p>Cancel the world search.</p>
<p>I want everything that's coming to Krusty the Clown, which is me, Krusty.</p>
<p>Hey, it's Krusty, all right.</p>
<p>Should I sh**t him gangland-style or execution-style?</p>
<p>Listen to your heart.</p>
<p>Well, I can't give you the car, Krusty.</p>
<p>But I can let you have this little number for practically nothing. Only $38,000.</p>
<p>Hey, what are all these holes?</p>
<p>Speed holes. They make the car go faster.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Speed holes.</p>
<p>You want my advice? I think you should buy this car.</p>
<p>We need more a*mo. Let's go to Big 5.</p>
<p>Krusty, your plastic surgery is complete. Now, when I remove the bandages... don't be alarmed by the total stranger staring back at you.</p>
<p>I look exactly the same, you moron!</p>
<p>Oh, nonsense, Krusty. You look at least 10 years younger.</p>
<p>Plus, I did your breasts.</p>
<p>Hear me complaining about the breasts?</p>
<p>Oh, what's the use in hiding?</p>
<p>I gotta go back to Springfield and face the music.</p>
<p>Can you loan me bus fare?</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!</p>
<p>What you diddily doing, neighbor?</p>
<p>I'm putting speed holes in my car. Makes it go faster.</p>
<p>Is that so? Well, gee, maybe the old Flanders-mobile could use...</p>
<p>Wow, lucky I always keep a Bible close to my heart...</p>
<p>Lucky I was wearing this extra-large piece of the true cross today.</p>
<p>I think I'll go inside.</p>
<p>What keeps doing that?</p>
<p>I told you we should've bought more than three b*ll*ts. Let's just grab him.</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>But wait. You can't k*ll me for being Krusty. I'm not him.</p>
<p>I'm Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>The same Homer Simpson who... crashed his car through the wall of our club?</p>
<p>Actually, my name is Barney. Yeah, Barney Gumble.</p>
<p>The same Barney Gumble who keeps taking pictures of my sister?</p>
<p>Actually, my real name is...</p>
<p>Think, Krusty, think. Joe Valachi.</p>
<p>Same Joe Valachi who squealed to the Senate committee about organized crime?</p>
<p>Benedict Arnold.</p>
<p>The same Benedict Arnold... who plotted to surrender West Point to the hated British?</p>
<p>I am so glad I had a chance to meet you... before we did this, Krusty, because I am a great fan.</p>
<p>Don Vittorio Dimaggio.</p>
<p>Krusty the Clown.</p>
<p>Sorry I have to do this, Krusty.</p>
<p>I cannot do it.</p>
<p>To m*rder a funnyman of such genius would be a crime.</p>
<p>Tell you what, Krusty.</p>
<p>Do for me my favorite trick, where you ride the little bike through the loop... and I will let you live.</p>
<p>But I've never been able to do the...</p>
<p>Hey, how about if I squirt you in the face with my boutonnière? Okay.</p>
<p>I'll never be able to do this trick. Never.</p>
<p>Go. Go.</p>
<p>Hey. I'm doing it. I'm doing it.</p>
<p>I'm the greatest clown in the world.</p>
<p>The fact that you did not do the trick well is the biggest insult of all.</p>
<p>Hey, guys. I came to...</p>
<p>Oh, you got a deadly game of cat and mouse going. I'll come back.</p>
<p>I'm seeing double here. Four Krustys.</p>
<p>Krusty. Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. You came here to save me.</p>
<p>Yeah. That's what I did.</p>
<p>My apologies to you. I almost made a grievous error.</p>
<p>Goodbye, Krusty.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>He can't k*ll anybody if he doesn't know which one's the real Krusty.</p>
<p>I am confused.</p>
<p>Good one, Krusty.</p>
<p>Oh, crap.</p>
<p>Because of that disrespectful display... I shall now k*ll both of you.</p>
<p>Unless you both go through the loop together.</p>
<p>I can't see, you idiot. Take your hands off my eyes.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Not bad.</p>
<p>Without the loop, it is nothing.</p>
<p>Yeah, Krustys!</p>
<p>Grazie. Grazie. You have brought great joy to this old ltalian stereotype.</p>
<p>No, no, Don Vittorio. You're not...</p>
<p>Yes, I am. I know it. I am.</p>
