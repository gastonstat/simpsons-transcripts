The Saga of Carl Carlson<br />
Original Air Date on May 19, 2013</p>
<p>It's been a brilliant night of women's tennis with Petrevkova narrowly edging Mashakova.</p>
<p><em>We take you now to doubles action between Pavlyuchenkeka-Vilnikova and Strakova-Mishtnupetrateva.</em></p>
<p>(laughs) To me, it's legs versus boobs.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: What the...?</p>
<p>Change the channel?</p>
<p>But I'm watching soft-core tennis.</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>: <em>Ki-Ya Karate Monsters!</em></p>
<p>What the hell is that?</p>
<p>It's our favorite show.</p>
<p>Mom said we could watch it.</p>
<p>Did she really say that?</p>
<p>Are you gonna walk upstairs and ask her?</p>
<p>(thunder rumbles)</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>(theme song playing)</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: From a Shaolin monastery in darkest Transylvania come helpful hell-spawn.</p>
<p>With homicidal honor, they rampage for peace.</p>
<p>Ki-Ya!</p>
<p>Ki-Ya!</p>
<p>Ki-Ya!</p>
<p>You like this now?</p>
<p>What about <em>Planet Jackson and the Earth Brigade?</em></p>
<p><strong>Bart</strong>: Dad, we don't watch that show anymore.</p>
<p>It's for babies.</p>
<p>Planet power!</p>
<p>(Bart and Lisa grunting)</p>
<p>Kung Fu Werewolf chop!</p>
<p>Blob Jitsu kick!</p>
<p>Stop it. No Karate Monsters at the dinner table.</p>
<p>It's <em>Ki-Ya</em> Karate Monsters.</p>
<p>Samurai shampoo blast!</p>
<p>Ninja throwing soap!</p>
<p>No Karate Monsters in the bathtub.</p>
<p><em>Ki-Ya</em></p>
<p>Karate Monsters.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Happy birthday, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: Happy birthday, Grampa.</p>
<p>(Grampa gasps)</p>
<p>Did this really happen?</p>
<p>Pill attack!</p>
<p>Actual sword attack!</p>
<p>I've had it.</p>
<p>No more Karate Monsters.</p>
<p>Ki-Ya... Ki-Ya...</p>
<p>(grumbles)</p>
<p>That's it. Tomorrow, we're doing something educational.</p>
<p>We're going to the science museum.</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>(Bart and Lisa laughing repeatedly)</p>
<p>(both grunting)</p>
<p>(sighs)</p>
<p>Finally, actual science.</p>
<p>(both groan)</p>
<p>You did it, baby.</p>
<p>You promised no fun, and you delivered.</p>
<p>(French accent): Ah, hello there.</p>
<p>I am Blaise Pascal, inventor of the probability theory.</p>
<p>What are the <em>odds</em> of meeting you here?</p>
<p>Excellent, I would say.</p>
<p>(ding)</p>
<p>My friend Silly Squirrel is about to buy a lottery ticket.</p>
<p>Silly Squirrel, do you know the probability of winning the lottery?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Why, you are more likely to be run over by a car.</p>
<p>Or be hit by lightning.</p>
<p>Or m*rder by an acquaintance.</p>
<p>If you understood probability, you would never play the lottery.</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>Guys, this science exhibit told me how stupid it is to play the lottery.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa. So you didn't buy our weekly ticket?</p>
<p>Are you nuts? You can't win if you don't play.</p>
<p>Hey, it's time.</p>
<p>Turn it on, turn it on!</p>
<p>Four lucky numbers for four best friends.</p>
<p><strong>Moe</strong>: Yeah, I always go with three, the number of brothers and sisters I, uh, <em>Hunger Games-ed</em> in the womb.</p>
<p>19 for me. Uh, for the best year of my life, 1996.</p>
<p>My number's 22.</p>
<p>No reason. Just... 22.</p>
<p>And I'm 69.</p>
<p>Because people always laugh when you say &quot;69.&quot;</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>No one knows why.</p>
<p>And the winning numbers are... three, 19, 22 and 69.</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>We won.</p>
<p>We won the Springfield Lottery.</p>
<p>That's 200 grand.</p>
<p>That's 50,000 bucks each!</p>
<p>(all cheering)</p>
<p>Guys, guys, we got to celebrate, throw a raging party!</p>
<p>I'll cash the ticket.</p>
<p>Homer, Homer, you get the food.</p>
<p>I'll get mini Dumpsters of wings from Garbage Wings.</p>
<p>And, Lenny, you get the drinks.</p>
<p>But we're already at a bar.</p>
<p>Oh, no. That's just gasoline and hot dog water.</p>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<p>We got the money.</p>
<p>(laughing): I'm so happy.</p>
<p>I'm so happy.</p>
<p>To the best feeling in the world... money.</p>
<p>(glass clinking)</p>
<p>Guys, I got big plans for these winnings.</p>
<p>I'm going to build... a swimming pool.</p>
<p>In-ground?</p>
<p>So freaking far in the ground, baby.</p>
<p>What about you, Carl?</p>
<p>What are you gonna do with your share of the money?</p>
<p>(crowd murmuring)</p>
<p>Oh, uh, I guess Carl ain't back yet from cashing in the ticket.</p>
<p>I'm sure he just got held up in traffic.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's probably what happened.</p>
<p>I wonder what's keeping Carl.</p>
<p>I hope our friend wasn't in an accident.</p>
<p>I'm glad we're the kind of people who are worried about Carl's safety instead of thinking that he ripped us off.</p>
<p>I wasn't thinking that.</p>
<p>Carl's our good friend.</p>
<p>Our good friend.</p>
<p>Yeah, good old Carl.</p>
<p>Good old Carl's phone went straight to voice mail.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>(tires screeching)</p>
<p>The power of friendship is so amazing, I don't feel at all suspicious of Carl.</p>
<p>Drive faster because of the power of friendship.</p>
<p>(tires screech)</p>
<p>(door creaks)</p>
<p>Carl's gone.</p>
<p>Our money's gone.</p>
<p>We've been betrayed.</p>
<p>By good old Carl!</p>
<p>Guys, I think we might need a new song.</p>
<p>♪ Four best friends ♪<br />
♪ Who never quarrel ♪</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: ♪ Homer Simpson, Lenny, Moe and... ♪<br />
♪ And... ♪</p>
<p>And no one.</p>
<p>All our lottery money, gone!</p>
<p>If I ever see that Carl again, I'm gonna freeze him, chop him up into ice cubes and scoop him into the urinal trough at the Gathering of the Juggalos!</p>
<p>Guys, give Carl a chance.</p>
<p>I'm sure he's gonna come back.</p>
<p>I don't think so.</p>
<p>His travel neck pillow's gone from its pedestal.</p>
<p><strong>Moe</strong>: Fellas, he ain't coming back.</p>
<p>You don't know that.</p>
<p>I'm gonna keep looking till we figure out what really happened.</p>
<p>See, I bet he flew to Quebec to bring us back authentic French-Canadian sugar pie.</p>
<p>(chuckles) I can taste it already.</p>
<p>Mmm. Thanks for the sugar pie, Carl.</p>
<p>Hey, what's this?</p>
<p>&quot;I've gone home.</p>
<p>Good-bye forever, Carl Carlson.&quot;</p>
<p>Where'd you go, Carl?</p>
<p>Had plans for that money, too.</p>
<p>I was gonna be one of those guys who's really into hot sauce, you know?</p>
<p>Hot sauce suspenders, hot sauce pajamas.</p>
<p>Bolo tie with a little chili pepper on it.</p>
<p>I still can't believe it was Carl who took your winnings.</p>
<p>I thought it would've been you.</p>
<p>Or you. Or you.</p>
<p>I know. Me, too.</p>
<p>It's the ultimate screw-over.</p>
<p>Maybe he had a good reason to give you the ultimate screw-over.</p>
<p>He said he went home, and his passport is gone.</p>
<p>What country is he from?</p>
<p>Uh... Uh...</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>You don't know where Carl is from?</p>
<p>Come on, you know how dudes are.</p>
<p>We don't go digging into the past.</p>
<p>We talk about guy stuff.</p>
<p>Like baseball and trucks and when guys lift too much weight and their bungus drops out.</p>
<p>You know, guy stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe if you'd talked less about guy stuff, you'd know more about your so-called friend.</p>
<p>Well, it don't matter no more, Midge.</p>
<p>Carl is gone, and we're already auditioning replacements.</p>
<p>This could not be more offensive.</p>
<p>Man!</p>
<p>Oh, of course.</p>
<p>Ugh!</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, get that out of here!</p>
<p>I don't ever want to see that moolah-stealing jackpot thief again!</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Something's reflected in the lenses of Carl's sunglasses.</p>
<p>I just need to get closer.</p>
<p>He's looking at a geyser.</p>
<p>And there's a sign in front of it!</p>
<p>Oh... It's too small to read.</p>
<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: Oh, it's backwards.</p>
<p><strong>Moe</strong>: Try this.</p>
<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: &quot;Strokkur Geysir.&quot;</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>The geyser is one of the most famous natural wonders in lceland.</p>
<p>I guess that's where Carl's from.</p>
<p>Ice-land?</p>
<p>Is that even a real place?</p>
<p>I thought it was Superman's Superman cave.</p>
<p>Iceland keeps the most detailed family records of any country in the world.</p>
<p>There!</p>
<p>Carl was adopted... by a couple who lives outside Reykjavik.</p>
<p><strong>Moe</strong>: Well, if that's Carl's home, then that's where our money is!</p>
<p>And that's where we're going.</p>
<p>We got to pack.</p>

<p><strong>Homer (whistles)</strong>: 50 bucks per bag?</p>
<p>I guess I'm only bringing one guitar on this revenge trip.</p>
<p>You're going so far away.</p>
<p>I'll miss you.</p>
<p>Baby, I'm going for us.</p>
<p>That money is going to dig us a swimming pool that'll take our broken family and make it whole.</p>
<p>We're not broken.</p>
<p>We're broken.</p>
<p>We're pretty broken.</p>
<p>(grumbles)</p>
<p>How am I going to sleep if someone isn't pushing me all the way to the very edge of the bed?</p>
<p>I've already taken care of that.</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>Oh, that's perfect.</p>
<p>I can't wait to see the smile on Carl's face when we surprise him.</p>
<p>I call first hug.</p>
<p>Hey, Lenny, when are you gonna wise up?</p>
<p>Carl never wants to see us again.</p>
<p>I'm done talking to you!</p>
<p>This is funny.</p>
<p>It says here lceland is green, and Greenland is icy.</p>
<p>The Vikings switched the names to trick everybody.</p>
<p>(all laughing)</p>
<p>It's funny.</p>
<p>That's pretty good.</p>
<p>Great gag!</p>
<p>Hey, Vikings, it's still pretty damn cold!</p>
<p>I only packed shorts.</p>
<p>Excuse me, uh, we're looking for our friend.</p>
<p>He's, uh... he's about so tall, uh, wears a jacket, he's, um, got no visible tattoos...</p>
<p>Just say he's black, Moe.</p>
<p>You say he's black!</p>
<p>His name is Carl Carlson.</p>
<p>Carl Carlson!</p>
<p>His family has been hated for 1,000 years.</p>
<p>How do you know about Carl's family?</p>
<p>Our country is very small, very judgmental and very nosy.</p>
<p>Ingimar Ogmundsson, how progresses your gonorrhea?</p>
<p>It heals, but slowly.</p>
<p>Why does everybody hate Carl's family?</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: <em>Here's why.</em></p>
<p>This saga tells of how Carl Carlson's family were the watchmen of the coast, always keeping an eye out for invading hordes.</p>
<p>Iceland's safety depended on their vigilance.</p>
<p>But the Carlsons failed in their duty.</p>
<p>The enemy invaded, laying waste to our lava fields, burning our sweaters and feasting upon our tiny horses.</p>
<p>Apparently, screwing over your friends is in Carl's blood-- his adopted bl*od.</p>
<p>All right, this is it, Carl's family home.</p>
<p>Twenty-two...</p>
<p>Ooh, phew, oh, that's a lot of letters.</p>
<p>22 Hjorleifsstrati.</p>
<p>So that's why 22 was Carl's lottery number.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that's why his sweatpants say &quot;Hjorleifsstrati&quot; across the butt.</p>
<p>(grunts) The gates are locked.</p>
<p>Well, then we'll just have to wait for him to come out.</p>
<p>Oh, man, stakeouts are so boring.</p>
<p>I wish I had something to look at.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I'll just read the car rental contract again.</p>
<p>Damage waiver, check.</p>
<p>Return with full t*nk of gas, check.</p>
<p>All drivers must be over the age of 25... and check.</p>
<p>Love you, Mom.</p>
<p>See you, Dad.</p>
<p>It's Carl!</p>
<p>Wake up, wake up!</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>(tires screech)</p>
<p>Ah, damn it, we lost him!</p>
<p>There he is.</p>
<p>And he's got our money!</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>(panting)</p>
<p>It's no use.</p>
<p>We're perfectly matched.</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: We did it!</p>
<p>Give us some answers, or you'll get a mouthful of rotten shark fermented in its own urine.</p>
<p>No, no, anything but the inedible, repulsive food of my native land.</p>
<p>Yeah, Carl, tell them the good reason you had for borrowing the money.</p>
<p>Look, I admit it.</p>
<p>I gave you the ultimate screw-over.</p>
<p>But I did it to clear my family's name.</p>
<p>Everyone blames the barbarian invasion on my ancestors.</p>
<p>But that saga had a missing page.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah... a page was torn out.</p>
<p>My family's always believed that we fought bravely against the invaders, and the missing page will prove it.</p>
<p>I took the lottery money to buy that page and restore my family's honor.</p>
<p>Why didn't you just tell us?</p>
<p>We're your friends.</p>
<p>I didn't tell you because... we're not friends.</p>
<p>(all gasp)</p>
<p>Friends share their feelings, their hopes, their dreams.</p>
<p>Friends know their friends are from lceland!</p>
<p>We are just guys who sit next to each other at a bar and talk about... ugh... guy stuff.</p>
<p>So all those years of hanging out meant nothing?</p>
<p>Not to me.</p>
<p>Sorry, Lenny.</p>
<p>That's all right.</p>
<p>Now we know.</p>
<p>It's all out in the open.</p>
<p>I guess it kind of makes it easier now for me to... to k*ll Carl!</p>
<p>(chuckles) When the nice ones snap, it's always a good show.</p>
<p>(clattering, punches landing)</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>Ow, my eye!</p>
<p>My eye!</p>
<p>My eye!</p>
<p>My eye!</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey, Lenny, forget him, forget him!</p>
<p>Look, we still got the money.</p>
<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: What the...?</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Wha...?</p>
<p>What the hell is this?</p>
<p>That's the missing page from the saga.</p>
<p>That's what I spent our lottery money on.</p>
<p>Then this belongs to us.</p>
<p>Please, give it back! Please!</p>
<p>It'll restore my family's honor!</p>
<p>Maybe we'd give it back to our friend, but we're not friends, remember?</p>
<p>Sorry, Carl.</p>
<p>It's World w*r II all over again.</p>
<p>America kicks lceland's ass.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Guys, do you think Carl was right?</p>
<p>What if we're not real friends?</p>
<p>Maybe we are just lonely guys who do... guy stuff.</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>(people screaming)</p>
<p>(computer chiming))</p>
<p>Hi, Homie!</p>
<p>Did you get the money?</p>
<p>The kids have been stocking up on pool noodles.</p>
<p>Put the noodles in the shed.</p>
<p>There isn't gonna be a swimming pool.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Carl spent all our money on this stupid page from a stupid saga.</p>
<p>I say we make it into saga soup and have ourselves a soup sip.</p>
<p>(slurps)</p>
<p>That'll show Carl for de-friending us in real life!</p>
<p>I know Carl did you wrong, but is destroying something he cares that much about really going to make you feel good?</p>
<p>Well, we won't know that till after.</p>
<p>Just read the saga and see what it says.</p>
<p>But how can we learn to read ancient lcelandic?</p>
<p>With these.</p>
<p>Yeah, my doctor says it's better for me not to sleep.</p>
<p>Thorn?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Forvitinn.</p>
<p>I can't do this, I can't do this!</p>
<p>You can't not do it!</p>
<p>Okay, let's see what this thing says.</p>
<p>&quot;When the barbarian invaders came, <em>the Carlsons met them with their w*apon ready...&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: <em>Wow, Carl's family really was brave.</em></p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: <em>&quot;...w*apon which they immediately threw down in surrender. The Carlsons then let the barbarians in the back gate and joined in the sacking, the looting and the volcano-ing of the village elders. The Carlsons then wrote down this saga so no one would ever forget their treachery and cowardice.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Carl's family was even worse than people thought.</p>
<p>They were the original ultimate scumbags.</p>
<p>Carl betrayed his friends, blew the lottery money... all for nothing.</p>
<p>Hey, guys...</p>
<p>I think I feel bad for Carl.</p>
<p>(speaking lcelandic)</p>
<p>Attention, everyone in lceland.</p>
<p>We have an important announcement.</p>
<p>Take a break from your dreary lives to hear Americans lecture you.</p>
<p>Ah! Ah!</p>
<p>Eh!</p>
<p>Is this everyone?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I've learned something about the people of lceland.</p>
<p>You have endured barbarian invasions, total financial collapse and a lesbian prime minister.</p>
<p>You've managed to survive on a craphole island that looks like the moon and smells like rotten eggs.</p>
<p>And to do that, you have to be stubborn.</p>
<p>But I ask you to put aside your stubbornness while I tell you about Carl Carlson.</p>
<p>Shame on Carl's family!</p>
<p>The bl*od of 1,000 tiny horses is on their hands.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter what happened 1,000 years ago, for Carl Carlson's honor has been redeemed by the deeds of Carl Carlson.</p>
<p>Carl Carlson who helped me move, even though I moved the week before.</p>
<p>(crowd gasping and murmuring)</p>
<p>Yeah, and when we were painting my house, Carl Carlson brought that blue tape, you know, that makes you really look like you know what you're doing.</p>
<p>You peel it off, and you got that super straight line there.</p>
<p>(crowd gasping and murmuring)</p>
<p>And when he brings a six-pack to my house, he doesn't take the extras home with him.</p>
<p>Carl Carlson leaves them in the fridge.</p>
<p>(crowd gasping and exclaiming)</p>
<p>Carl Carlson is our friend, even if he doesn't believe it.</p>
<p>If we can forgive Carl for stealing our lottery winnings, maybe youse can find it in youse's hearts to forgive his ancestors.</p>
<p>The many small kindnesses of Carl Carlson have redeemed his family forever.</p>
<p>Mom, Dad, our family can show our face in public for the first time in 1,000 years.</p>
<p>Ai.</p>
<p>Ai.</p>
<p>How can you say these men are not your true friends?</p>
<p>I... I can't!</p>
<p>(sobbing): I can't!</p>
<p><strong>Crowd</strong>: Ai.</p>
<p>Guys, thanks for teaching me the true meaning of male friendship.</p>
<p>The stuff that comes from in here... that is guy stuff.</p>
<p>We don't get together to share our emotions.</p>
<p>We get together to escape them.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'd tell you guys I love you, but, uh, I don't want to say it, and you don't want to hear it.</p>
<p>To nothing!</p>
<p>Okay, everyone, get ready to see your brand-new...</p>
<p>Oh, oh! (laughs) What is it, what is it, what is it?</p>
<p>...keg-pools!</p>
<p>Yay!</p>
<p>Yay!</p>
<p>Hey! Aah!</p>
<p>(kids laughing)</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>I'm going home.</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
