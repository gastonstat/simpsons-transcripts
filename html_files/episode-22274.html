Dial 'N' for Nerder</p>
<p>Come and get me, you syrupy stack of man-cakes.</p>
<p>It's too much work.</p>
<p>Why don't you come and get me?</p>
<p>Jeez Louise, are you okay?</p>
<p>Just give me a minute.</p>
<p>Uh, but feel free to go nuts on me.</p>
<p>Oh, boy, dinner time!</p>
<p>The perfect break between work and drunk.</p>
<p>Wait. What's that smell?</p>
<p>It's like a stalk of broccoli fell in a pot of boiling water.</p>
<p>It's your new diet!</p>
<p>But I have all those old diets I still haven't finished.</p>
<p>Your lack of bedroom pizzazz last night started me worrying, so I hired this nutritionist, Betsy Bidwell.</p>
<p>Homer, did you know I used to weigh 400 pounds?</p>
<p>I'll bet no man would touch you.</p>
<p>Well, I went from fat to &quot;all that&quot; using my simple, foolproof diet.</p>
<p>It's all about little substitutions.</p>
<p>Instead of French toast for breakfast, why not eat a bell pepper?</p>
<p>When you crave something sugary, eat a bell pepper.</p>
<p>Want a beer?</p>
<p>Bell pepper!</p>
<p>It's tangy like a pepper, but crunchy like a bell!</p>
<p>Bell pepper!</p>
<p>Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs.</p>
<p>One, please.</p>
<p>Bell peppers... piping cold, crunchy and bland.</p>
<p>Three, please.</p>
<p>Not quite.</p>
<p>Yeah. Get out.</p>
<p>You've gained seven pounds!</p>
<p>Well, they say muscle weighse than fat.</p>
<p>Homer, your body is all fat.</p>
<p>Homie, have you been cheating on your diet?!</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>I'm not even gonna dignify that with eye contact.</p>
<p>What you doin', Mom, goin' crazy?</p>
<p>Searching for evidence.</p>
<p>I know your father's cheating on his diet.</p>
<p>Hey, Marge, looking for something?</p>
<p>I'm looking for something, too... a bell pepper I don't like.</p>
<p>Maybe it'll be this one.</p>
<p>Wrong again.</p>
<p>See that fat lady with the moustache?</p>
<p>That's you.</p>
<p>See that hippo rolling in dung?</p>
<p>You're the dung.</p>
<p>Now, that's enough. You each got one in.</p>
<p>Oh, but hers was better!</p>
<p>Meet Jennifer.</p>
<p>She's worried her acupuncturist boyfriend is sticking it to someone else.</p>
<p>He used to be so loving.</p>
<p>Now he says he's always working late, but when he comes home, his needles aren't even bloody!</p>
<p>I've tried everything except talking to him.</p>
<p>Help me, TV show!</p>
<p>We'll find out if Jennifer's boyfriend has been fooling around on Sneakers.</p>
<p>If you suspect a loved one of cheating on you, call the Sneakers hotline.</p>
<p>Also call if you don't suspect.</p>
<p>Most cheating happens when you think everything is just great.</p>
<p>Hmm. Could this show help me with eating cheating?</p>
<p>Out of the house, kids!</p>
<p>I have to make an adult phone call.</p>
<p>Oh, man, not again...</p>
<p>How would you...? Come on.</p>
<p>Go, go, go, go, go!</p>
<p>Springfields national park Now smaller than ever.</p>
<p>Hey, I didn't know this park was here.</p>
<p>You wrote a report on it last week.</p>
<p>The lnternet wrote it.</p>
<p>I just handed it in.</p>
<p>Whoa, check that out!</p>
<p>Cool! The strong kicking the weak's butt.</p>
<p>It's disgusting!</p>
<p>Now you two play nice!</p>
<p>This is my husband.</p>
<p>I think he's been sneakering on his diet.</p>
<p>I didn't used to mind it when he'd lock the bathroom door and snack off, but when he's getting it regular, night after night after night...</p>
<p>There, there.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I'm so emotional.</p>
<p>No, I mean, cry to the camera over there.</p>
<p>There.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Hey, Martin, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Excavating for arrowheads!</p>
<p>Dude, it's Saturday.</p>
<p>What kindof a freak wastes his...?</p>
<p>May I join you?</p>
<p>Care to make ita trio, Bart?</p>
<p>You can brush, and I can blow!</p>
<p>Well, I agree you blow.</p>
<p>Then it's a plan.</p>
<p>A lot of people blow, but no one blows like you.</p>
<p>High praiseindeed!</p>
<p>When you look up blow in the dictionary...</p>
<p>Bart, he's not gonna get it!</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>The bone's the very thing, methinks, to prank my sister and the dink.</p>
<p>Martin, I've made a major discovery!</p>
<p>A bone?!</p>
<p>It could be one of the major homos!</p>
<p>You're one oft he major...</p>
<p>Forget it.</p>
<p>Martin!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Grab on to this!</p>
<p>Come on, wake up!</p>
<p>Bart!</p>
<p>You can't just run away from this!</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>I can bike away much faster, and ring the bell to drown out bad thoughts!</p>
<p>But Bart...</p>
<p>Bart, Martin could be seriously hurt, or worse.</p>
<p>You're right. We have to do something.</p>
<p>Let's watch TV!</p>
<p><em>Happy, happy safe at home.</p>
<p>Happy, happy...</em></p>
<p>We interrupt Kaptain Kiddy's Komfort Karnival to report on a grisly incident involving a small child, who has apparently plunged off a guardrail here at Springfield National Park.</p>
<p>According to this pocket protector, the v*ctim's name is Martin Prince.</p>
<p>Sadly, his pocket was protected, but nothing else.</p>
<p>And we know exactly who is to blame.</p>
<p>No one.</p>
<p>The boy clearly fell by accident.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>He crashed through the tree canopy there, and was presumably eaten by this cougar, who is still coughing up parts of the boy's clothes.</p>
<p>Tragic, just tragic.</p>
<p>You think this would fit little Ralphy?</p>
<p>Chief, that's evidence.</p>
<p>I know, but after it's evidence, it's a shirt again, isn't it?</p>
<p>So Chief, what's your final word on the Prince boy?</p>
<p>Hmm? Oh, dead. Definitely dead.</p>
<p>Uh, Chief, aren't we supposed to, uh, notify the mily first?</p>
<p>What do you think I'm doing right now?</p>
<p><em>Happy, happy, safe at home.</em></p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>We're m*rder!</p>
<p>Hey, I was trying to help him.</p>
<p>At worst, I'm an accomplice.</p>
<p>I'm an accomplice!</p>
<p>Bookmobile.</p>
<p>Got any Joyce Carol Oates?</p>
<p>Nope. It's allDanielle Steel.</p>
<p>I've been in trouble, but never like this.</p>
<p>Guess I'll go turn myself in.</p>
<p>Uh, let's think about this.</p>
<p>Martin's gone, but it was an accident.</p>
<p>Ruining our lives won't bring him back.</p>
<p>Lisa!</p>
<p>You're saying we shouldn't tell the truth?!</p>
<p>I'm saying this is worse than a million A minuses!</p>
<p>So, how was your outside time?</p>
<p>We were never outside. We were here all day.</p>
<p>That quick talking is never a good sign.</p>
<p>That's usually true, but in this case, it's not.</p>
<p>Hmm. The kids are acting awfully strange.</p>
<p>Maybe I should sit down with them and...</p>
<p>Homer, where are you going?!</p>
<p>Work.</p>
<p>It's 4:00 o'clock on a Saturday.</p>
<p>I, uh,... have to count the atoms at the nuclear plant.</p>
<p>Conservation of mass. It's the law.</p>
<p>The load is on the road.</p>
<p>This episode's gonna be great.</p>
<p>It'll finally win me the respect of my father, the Reverend Billy Graham, Junior.</p>
<p>Martin Prince was known by many names...</p>
<p>Martin Priss, Martin Princess, Fartin' Prince, Martin the Brown-Nosed Reindeer...</p>
<p>That was mine.</p>
<p>Martin was a shy, awkward child who will never fulfill his promise to become a weird, unloved adult.</p>
<p>The Audio-Visual Club has prepared a video tribute to their fallen associate.</p>
<p><em>I will remember you.</p>
<p>Will you remember me?</p>
<p>Don't let your life pass you by</em></p>

<p>Jimbo, stop that.</p>
<p>Usually when I do something bad, I feel good.</p>
<p>But not this time.</p>
<p>Martin was like Jesus, only real.</p>
<p>Bart, keep it together. People are looking.</p>
<p>I'm filled with rue.</p>
<p>You know, something bugs me.</p>
<p>Martin was afraid of heights.</p>
<p>What's he doing on a cliff?</p>
<p>It don't add up.</p>
<p>Hey, look who's trying to add.</p>
<p>You wuss.</p>
<p>The pig is in the sty.</p>
<p>You know, I used to make documentaries about coal miners, migrant workers, things that mattered.</p>
<p>Yeah yeah, we're all whores. Just get in there.</p>
<p>Into your hands, I commend this crap.</p>
<p>Well, enough burning ants.</p>
<p>Time to investigate.</p>
<p>I now declare you chips and salsa.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, kids.</p>
<p>Um... what's up?</p>
<p>What do you mean &quot;what's up&quot;?</p>
<p>Why would something be up?</p>
<p>Yeah, nothing's up, nothing's down, except for Martin, who died.</p>
<p>Idiot!</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>Well, I certainly wasn't eating chips and salsa from this briefcase.</p>
<p>What's up?</p>
<p>Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.</p>
<p>Mmm, lamb.</p>
<p>Uh, I've never said this before, but turn the camera off.</p>
<p>Hey, you little m*rder.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>Those shades are k*ll me, they're so cute.</p>
<p>Act like you're shopping.</p>
<p>We can't be seen together.</p>
<p>But we're brother and sister.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Give me an lndian burn.</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>Don't make me say &quot;Indian&quot; again.</p>
<p>Afternoon.</p>
<p>Doing a little shopping, huh?</p>
<p>Shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart.</p>
<p>I like how &quot;Kwik&quot; is spelled with a &quot;K.&quot;</p>
<p>It's a quicker way of spelling &quot;quick.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, you're busy people.</p>
<p>I'll let you get on with your day.</p>
<p>Oh, there is one other thing.</p>
<p>I was up in Springfield National Park.</p>
<p>You know, where Martin bit the big one?</p>
<p>Found this bone tied to a string.</p>
<p>Almost like someone was playing a prank on him.</p>
<p>You like pranks, don't you, dingus?</p>
<p>I... like pranks.</p>
<p>Everyone likes pranks, e- even Dr. Hibbert.</p>
<p>I hate pranks.</p>
<p>Well, better get going.</p>
<p>The missus is cooking meat loaf tonight.</p>
<p>My mom... Mrs. Muntz.</p>
<p>Bart, I have a plan.</p>
<p>We go to the morgue and come back with a hand, put its fingerprints all over the railing...</p>
<p>Why are you being so quiet, Bart?</p>
<p>Are you judging me?</p>
<p>Please don't judge me.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't live with the guilt.</p>
<p>I'm going to Martin's house to end it all&quot;?!</p>
<p>Come on, pick up, pick up, I know you're there.</p>
<p>Listen, baby, the other night was great, but it can never happen again.</p>
<p>Oh, who am I kidding?</p>
<p>I have to see you right now.</p>
<p>Bart, no, don't do... whatever the heck you're doing.</p>
<p>I'm tending to Martin's butterfly enclosure.</p>
<p>His butterflies are emerging from their chrysalises tonight.</p>
<p>You said you wanted to end it all.</p>
<p>By which I meant bring Martin's butterfly project to completion.</p>
<p>I can't take it anymore.</p>
<p>The stress is k*ll me.</p>
<p>I'm on a freight train to Crazy Town.</p>
<p>Çalm down.</p>
<p>You calm down!</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>The butterflies are hatching.</p>
<p>Aren't they beautiful?</p>
<p><em>Greetings, my friends.</p>
<p>This beguiling lute solo will ease your metamorphoses.</em></p>
<p>Oh, it's a tape.</p>
<p>Martin must have set it to go off when the chrysalises hatched.</p>
<p>Now, if I may mimic your mother's feeding call...</p>
<p>Clawdy-claw, clickety-cloo, clawdy-claw...</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I thought I turned that tape off.</p>
<p>Maybe you just put it on auto-reverse.</p>
<p>&quot;Congratulations on purchasing the Sanyo DL30, the finest non-reversing tape player&quot;...</p>
<p>Here you go, hon- one Butterscotch Stallion.</p>
<p>Homer Jay Simpson!</p>
<p>Pudding power, activate!</p>
<p>Oh, no, you don't.</p>
<p>Let him have it, Marge.</p>
<p>Sweetheart, I didn't want to deceive you.</p>
<p>I just couldn't stand to see the disappointment in your beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>That's it, Marge. Slap him good.</p>
<p>Zack, you're not trying to help our marriage.</p>
<p>You're trying to split us up.</p>
<p>I'd rather have a chubby hubby than a sexy exy.</p>
<p>Aw, Marge, if there was a reality show called Fat Guys Who Really Love Their Wives, that not only would it be an enormous ratings success, but I'd be the first one on it.</p>
<p>Marge, you've given me a lot to think about today.</p>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to the editing room to make you look insane.</p>
<p>To the post-production trailer!</p>
<p>Where is this music coming from?</p>
<p>Get off me!</p>
<p>His foot is caught in my button hole.</p>
<p>I almost flicked an innocent butterfly.</p>
<p>Bart, we're turning into monsters.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>No, not cool.</p>
<p>We have to do the right thing and come clean.</p>
<p>Listen, world, we k*ll Martin Prince!</p>
<p>That's all I needed to hear.</p>
<p>You almost got away with it, but here's where you got sloppy: shouting out that you did it.</p>
<p>Oh, man, I'm too pretty to go to jail.</p>
<p>You don't know how lucky you are.</p>
<p>I'm just glad it was you who brought us in, Nelson.</p>
<p>Remember when we used to date?</p>
<p>If you let me go, we can get back together.</p>
<p>I never let you b*mb my Malibu Stacy.</p>
<p>I'll let you do it now.</p>
<p>Save it for the warden.</p>
<p>Please, keep it down around the newborns.</p>
<p>To quote Mark Twain, &quot;rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeah, and rumors of your wussiness are a hundred percent true.</p>
<p>Now tell us how you survived the fall.</p>
<p>For years I've worn underwear with a wedgie-accommodating waistband.</p>
<p>On that fateful day, these mighty whiteys saved my life.</p>
<p><em>Malheureusement, I landed right next to a cougar's lair.</p>
<p>He saw me as easy prey.</p>
<p>I feared death was a certainty until I was saved by simple physics.</p>
<p>I landed on a small isle in the middle of a murky lake.</p>
<p>I spent an hour fashioning an escape raft and three days crafting this modesty skirt.</em></p>
<p>Well, it's good to have you alive, Dorkburger, and as for you two, I hope you learned your lesson.</p>
<p>I learned that beneath my goody two-shoes lie some very dark socks.</p>
<p>And I learned that k*ll a nerd is not as fun as it sounds.</p>
<p>There is just one more thing.</p>
<p>You folks have a good night now.</p>
