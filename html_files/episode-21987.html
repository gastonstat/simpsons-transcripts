<p>Is there any sweeter sign? Well, maybe &quot;high voltage.&quot;</p>
<p>Hello, son. You want to try this flying motorcycle I just invented?</p>
<p>No time.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is for the ages.</p>
<p>Like Stonehenge, this site will forever be a mystery.</p>
<p>Who was Bart?</p>
<p>And how did he manage to write his name in solid cement?</p>
<p>He must've been smarter than his sister Lisa, about whom we know nothing.</p>
<p>Say, let's bring him back to life by using technology.</p>
<p>Ay caramba!</p>
<p>What's normal to him amazes us.</p>
<p>He will be our new god.</p>
<p>Good, somebody's shadow. I'll just turn and brag about my work.</p>
<p>Bart, you've graffito-tagged public property.</p>
<p>It was an accident.</p>
<p>I can't believe you vandalized your own hometown, Bart.</p>
<p>What would Jebediah Springfield say?</p>
<p>He'd be cool with it.</p>
<p>Homer, will you please help me make a big deal of this?</p>
<p>What for? Nobody cared when Bogart defaced that sidewalk in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Well, I'm just shocked by this whole family.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to good old-fashioned town pride?</p>
<p>It's been going down since the lake caught fire.</p>
<p>Now, just a darn minute. This town is a part of who you are.</p>
<p>This is a Springfield lsotopes cap.</p>
<p>When you wear it, you're wearing Springfield.</p>
<p>When you eat a fish from our river, you're eating Springfield.</p>
<p>When you make lemonade from our trees, you're drinking Springfield.</p>
<p>Mom, when you give that lecture, you're boring Springfield.</p>
<p>You have roots in this town, and you ought to show respect.</p>
<p>This town is a part of us all.</p>
<p>A part of us all. A part of us all.</p>
<p>Sorry to repeat myself, but it'll help you remember.</p>
<p>This town is a part of us all.</p>
<p>A part of us all. A part of us all.</p>
<p>Wow, that does work.</p>
<p>Hey, gonna win some this season?</p>
<p>Gonna try.</p>
<p>When it comes to catching trout, nothing b*at the German light infantry.</p>
<p>Beautiful, aren't they?</p>
<p>Yep. I'm gonna huck them at cars.</p>
<p>Hey, Milhouse. How's the lemonade business?</p>
<p>It's clearly booming, Bart.</p>
<p>I don't even want any. I just bought a pity glass.</p>
<p>We've squozen our whole supply. To the lemon tree!</p>
<p>Thar she grows.</p>
<p>You know, Milhouse, I've been thinking. This town ain't so bad.</p>
<p>Good friends, lots of lemons, numerous angel sightings.</p>
<p>When you get right down to it, Springfield's a pretty cool place to live.</p>
<p>Springfield sucks.</p>
<p>Hey, stop talking bad about my town, man.</p>
<p>Why don't you make me.</p>
<p>I don't make trash, I burn it.</p>
<p>Then I guess you're a garbage man.</p>
<p>I know you are, but what am I?</p>
<p>A garbage man.</p>
<p>Oh, I know you are, but what am I?</p>
<p>A garbage man.</p>
<p>I know you are, but what am I?</p>
<p>A garbage man.</p>
<p>Takes one to know one.</p>
<p>Checkmate.</p>
<p>Hey, kid.</p>
<p>Stop wearing your backpack over one shoulder.</p>
<p>We invented that. Copycat.</p>
<p>You copied us.</p>
<p>Step over this line and say that. I'll kick your butt... at Nintendo.</p>
<p>I just put a rock in your crummy town.</p>
<p>That's a crud rock. It belongs in Crudtown.</p>
<p>Look at the weak little baby. You're stupid, you stupid, weak baby.</p>
<p>Come on, let's get out of here.</p>
<p>Hey, they're taking our lemons.</p>
<p>We can't spare a single one.</p>
<p>You just got citric acid in my eye.</p>
<p>You'll pay for that, Springfield.</p>
<p>Some things never change.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody, an old man's talking.</p>
<p>Grampa's the name.</p>
<p>Did you know this tree dates back to frontier times?</p>
<p>Shut up!</p>
<p>It all began when Jebediah Springfield first came to these lands... with his partner, Shelbyville Manhattan.</p>
<p>People, our search is over.</p>
<p>On this site, we shall build a new town, where we can worship freely... govern justly and grow vast fields of hemp for making rope and blankets.</p>
<p>Yes, and marry our cousins.</p>
<p>I was...</p>
<p>What are you talking about, Shelbyville? Why would we marry our cousins?</p>
<p>Because they're so attractive.</p>
<p>I thought that was the whole point of this journey.</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>I tell you... I won't live in a town that robs men of the right to marry their cousins.</p>
<p>Well, then we'll form our own town.</p>
<p>Who will come and live a life devoted to chastity, abstinence... and a flavorless mush I call rootmarm?</p>
<p>The town of Springfield was born on that day.</p>
<p>And to mark that sweet moment, our people planted this lemon tree... lemons being the sweetest fruit available at the time.</p>
<p>Those Shelbyville kids think they're hot. You know what? They're not.</p>
<p>I really agree with you on this one, Bart.</p>
<p>Class, please.</p>
<p>If you don't learn Roman numerals... you'll never know when movies were copyrighted.</p>
<p>Come quick. Something's happened. No time to explain.</p>
<p>No, children. No.</p>
<p>Your education is important. Roman numerals, et cetera.</p>
<p>Whatever. I tried.</p>
<p>Are you sure it wouldn't be faster to just tell us what happened?</p>
<p>No. I said there's no time to explain, and I stick by that.</p>
<p>The lemon tree's gone.</p>
<p>And the tracks appear to lead into Shelbyville.</p>
<p>Oh, look, a clue. A candy-bar wrapper.</p>
<p>Oh, they're always eating candy in Shelbyville.</p>
<p>They love the sweet taste.</p>
<p>We gotta get that tree back.</p>
<p>You mean going to Shelbyville? We'll never make it out alive.</p>
<p>That lemon tree's part of our town and, as kids, the backbone of our economy.</p>
<p>We'll get it back or choke their rivers with our dead.</p>
<p>Where are you going, Bart?</p>
<p>Mom, you won't believe this, but something you said got through to me.</p>
<p>And now, I am going to teach some kids a lesson.</p>
<p>I choose to take that literally.</p>
<p>Death to Shelbyville!</p>
<p>Yes, Bart's a tutor now. Tute on, son.</p>
<p>Tute on.</p>
<p>Hey, Milhouse, get your invasion supplies, and let's go.</p>
<p>Get him. Come on.</p>
<p>Where did he go?</p>
<p>Over here, my friends.</p>
<p>Or is it over here?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Here's how it goes. I'm the leader. Milhouse is my loyal sidekick.</p>
<p>Nelson's the tough guy. Martin's the smart guy.</p>
<p>Todd's the religious guy who ends up going crazy.</p>
<p>And now... the time has come to cross this line into mystery and danger.</p>
<p>To step out of childhood and become men.</p>
<p>If you get lost, remember... you can always find east by staring directly at the sun.</p>
<p>Here's a tip. Put a pinch of sage in your boots... and all day long, a spicy scent is your reward.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh. Look.</p>
<p>The fire hydrants here are yellow.</p>
<p>This place is starting to freak me out.</p>
<p>Danger coming. Behind us.</p>
<p>What is it, boy? Is there something behind that wall we should b*at up?</p>
<p>No time to check it out now. We've got lemonade to sell.</p>
<p>Radical.</p>
<p>They're getting rich off us.</p>
<p>And that kid with the backpack said &quot;radical.&quot;</p>
<p>I say &quot;radical.&quot; That's my thing that I say.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm gonna explode here.</p>
<p>It's lunchtime. Do you know where your brother's tutoring?</p>
<p>Tutoring? The only thing Bart's teaching is guerrilla combat in Shelbyville.</p>
<p>You have a number we can reach him?</p>
<p>No, Mom.</p>
<p>Bart and some kids ran off to wage w*r on Shelbyville.</p>
<p>Homer, come quick.</p>
<p>Bart's quit his tutoring job and joined a violence gang.</p>
<p>The trail has become indistinct.</p>
<p>I suggest we split up to cover more ground.</p>
<p>Good idea. Milhouse, you and me will be Omega Team.</p>
<p>Todd, you and Data are Team Strike Force.</p>
<p>Nelson, that leaves you and Martin.</p>
<p>Team Discovery Channel.</p>
<p>Your wussiness better come in handy.</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>I want some answers.</p>
<p>Okay, folks, look, I called the police captain in Shelbyville.</p>
<p>He says he hasn't seen our kids.</p>
<p>But if they show up in the morgue, he's gonna fax us.</p>
<p>Oh, man, I hate those Shelbyville jerks.</p>
<p>Honey, I was born in Shelbyville.</p>
<p>And it tears me up inside.</p>
<p>This is my fault. I tried to teach Bart about town pride.</p>
<p>But the power of my words filled him with a sort of madness.</p>
<p>Marge, you can't blame all of Bart's problems on your one little speech.</p>
<p>If anything turned him bad... it's that time you let him wear a bathing suit instead of underwear.</p>
<p>And let's not forget your little speech.</p>
<p>Isn't there anything we can do?</p>
<p>Yes, there is. Come on, everybody.</p>
<p>Let's go into Shelbyville and get those kids back ourselves.</p>
<p>I got an RV we can use.</p>
<p>Flanders'.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Yeah, let's do it.</p>
<p>Okay, but just go a little bit easy on it.</p>
<p>Pile in, everybody. No time to wipe your feet.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Okay, piglet, start squealing.</p>
<p>Where'd you get the lemons for this lemonade?</p>
<p>This is Country Time Lemonade Mix.</p>
<p>There's never been anything close to a lemon in it. I swear.</p>
<p>Hey. Nobody hassles my little brother.</p>
<p>Hey. And no one manhandles the bosom chum of Nelson Muntz.</p>
<p>Spring forth, burly protector, and save me.</p>
<p>Jeez.</p>
<p><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content"><br />

<p>I never hang out with him, normally.</p>
<p>Hark to the tale of Nelson And the boy he loved so dear.</p>
<p>They remained the best of friends For years and years and years.</p>
<p>What are they saying?</p>
<p>I'm not sure.</p>
<p>I thought you said you could read lips.</p>
<p>I assumed I could.</p>
<p>It's no use, Milhouse.</p>
<p>If we're gonna find that lemon tree, I've got to go undercover.</p>
<p>What I need is a new face.</p>
<p>You leave that to the baron and me.</p>
<p>Hello there, fellow Shelbyvillians.</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>If you're from Shelbyville, how come we've never seen you at school?</p>
<p>I don't go to school.</p>
<p>Okay, what's two plus two?</p>
<p>Five.</p>
<p>Story checks out.</p>
<p>We just got word there's Springfield kids in town.</p>
<p>Curse those handsome devils.</p>
<p>We're going up to the bluffs to paint &quot;Springfield sucks&quot; in huge letters.</p>
<p>That way, whenever they look into Shelbyville, they'll realize that they suck.</p>
<p>Radical.</p>
<p>Quit copying me.</p>
<p>You know, I wish there was a Springfield kid here right now.</p>
<p>I'd fill his mouth with stinkbugs.</p>
<p>No, not in my mouth... is what the kid would say. To the bluffs.</p>
<p>Well, a friendly Springfield hello there, neighbors.</p>
<p>You know, we think some kids of ours may be missing in your town.</p>
<p>Missing children?</p>
<p>Sounds like Springfield's got a discipline problem.</p>
<p>Maybe that's why we b*at them at football nearly half the time, huh?</p>
<p>Quit stalling, kid. Write &quot;Springfield sucks&quot; in giant letters.</p>
<p>His can control is excellent.</p>
<p>Yes. And that wig makes him look a lot like one of the b*at.</p>
<p>That's right, the stranger who walks amongst you is me, Bart Simpson.</p>
<p>You know, Bart Simpson.</p>
<p>From Springfield?</p>
<p>He's from Springfield. Get him!</p>
<p>I'll use these spray cans as jetpacks and fly to safety.</p>
<p>So long, losers.</p>
<p>You're dead.</p>
<p>Hey, look. Someone's attractive cousin.</p>
<p>Where? Where?</p>
<p>I don't see anybody.</p>
<p>So he thinks he can out-skateboard me, huh?</p>
<p>Launch me, boys.</p>
<p>Slow down, you sidewalk-surfing cube-gleamers.</p>
<p>&quot;Wet cement.&quot;</p>
<p>I could sure use that flying motorcycle now.</p>
<p>You had your chance.</p>
<p>Safe at last.</p>
<p>&quot;Caution: Exit through door seven only.</p>
<p>All other rooms contain man-eating tigers.&quot;</p>
<p>Roman numerals. They never even tried to teach us that in school.</p>
<p>Milhouse, what's seven in Roman numerals?</p>
<p>I'll tell you, but you really should end each transmission with the word &quot;over.&quot;</p>
<p>Over.</p>
<p>Correction: The only thing that's over is that transmission.</p>
<p>Is this the untimely end of Milhouse?</p>
<p>But Milhouse is my name.</p>
<p>But I thought I was the only one.</p>
<p>A pain I know all too well.</p>
<p>So this is what it feels like when doves cry.</p>
<p>Milhouse. Milhouse. Now what do I do?</p>
<p>Wait. I got it.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>I don't got it. Okay, think, Bart.</p>
<p>Where have you seen Roman numerals before?</p>
<p>I know. Rocky V. That was the fifth one.</p>
<p>So Rocky V plus Rocky II equals Rocky VII: Adrian's Revenge!</p>
<p>Come back here.</p>
<p>It's no use. I'm never gonna find that tree.</p>
<p>This whole raid was as useless as that yellow, lemon-shaped rock over there.</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>There's a lemon behind that rock.</p>
<p>The tree!</p>
<p>A car impound lot.</p>
<p>The impenetrable fortress of suburbia.</p>
<p>We'll never get the tree back now.</p>
<p>Keep your voices down, boys.</p>
<p>We didn't get this far to get found out.</p>
<p>Found them! You kids are in big trouble.</p>
<p>Running away from home like this.</p>
<p>But they stole our lemon tree.</p>
<p>I don't care what excuse you've got.</p>
<p>Nothing's gonna stop me in the middle of this speech.</p>
<p>You're gonna... Lemon tree?</p>
<p>That tree's been in Springfield since the time of our forefathers.</p>
<p>Give it back, or we'll bust in there and take it.</p>
<p>Bust in here and take it?</p>
<p>You must stupider than you look.</p>
<p>Stupider like a fox!</p>
<p>I'm okay.</p>
<p>Don't you get it, Springfield? It's over. You lose.</p>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, all this talk has made me hungry.</p>
<p>This is the darkest day in the history of Springfield.</p>
<p>If anybody wants me, I'll be in the shower.</p>
<p>There's got to be a way to get that tree back.</p>
<p>Hey, look. A hospital.</p>
<p>Pull in there.</p>
<p>Oh, great. Now I'm upside down.</p>
<p>Oh, dear, some thoughtless human being has parked in a hospital zone.</p>
<p>No one in history has ever done anything this clever.</p>
<p>I'll get the gate.</p>
<p>That's okay, son. I'll take care of him.</p>
<p>Faster, son! He's got a taste for meat now.</p>
<p>Get out here, son. There's a-doings a-transpiring.</p>
<p>Let's shut the gate and seal them in.</p>
<p>g*n it, Flanders.</p>
<p>It won't start. Something's draining the battery.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>We made it.</p>
<p>Eat my shorts, Shelbyville.</p>
<p>Eat my shorts.</p>
<p>Eat my shorts.</p>
<p>Yes, eat all of our shirts.</p>
<p>Oh, you lousy Springfielders, you...</p>
<p>Shake harder, boy.</p>
<p>We did it!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And with that, a mighty cheer went up from the heroes of Springfield.</p>
<p>They had brought the sacred tree back to its native soil.</p>
<p>And though Flanders was stuck with the impound fee... he could easily afford it.</p>
<p>More lemonade, Bart?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Say when.</p>
<p>There are over 14 parts of the lemon that are...</p>
<p>And with that, a mighty cheer went up from the heroes of Shelbyville.</p>
<p>They had banished the awful lemon tree forever... because it was haunted.</p>
<p>Now, let's all celebrate... with a cool glass of turnip juice.</p>
