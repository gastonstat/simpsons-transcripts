<p>(TIRES SCREECHING)</p>
<p>D'oh!</p>
<p>(EXCLAMING)</p>
<p>(TIRES SCREECHING)</p>
<p>(DINGS)</p>
<p>Ha-ha!</p>
<p>And now let us bow our heads in silent prayer.</p>
<p>Maggie! That's not what you do with a hymnal.</p>
<p>Homer!</p>
<p>What? I forgot to floss this morning.</p>
<p>Oh, somethings wrong with Maggie.</p>
<p>We should get her to Dr. Hibbert.</p>
<p>But I don't see him anywhere.</p>
<p>The Hibberts now attend a more boisterous house of worship. (CLEARS THROAT)</p>
<p>(LIVELY GOSPEL MUSIC PLAYING)</p>
<p>(SINGING) ♪ Let the light ♪</p>
<p>(All) Shine on!</p>
<p><em>From the lighthouse</em></p>
<p>(All) <em>Shine on!</p>
<p>Shine on me</em></p>
<p>(All) <em>Shine on.</p>
<p>Shine on me</em></p>
<p>(All) <em>Shine on.</p>
<p>In the morning</em></p>
<p>This is awesome. Black God rules.</p>
<p><em>Shine on Oh, let it shine on</em></p>
<p>(CHUCKLES)</p>
<p>Um, Dr. Hibbert? Mmm-hmm?</p>
<p>I hate to interrupt while you're rejoicing but Maggie is terribly itchy.</p>
<p>Mmm-hmm!</p>
<p>Oh, this looks to be the initial stages of chicken pox.</p>
<p>Say amen! Amen!</p>
<p>Coat Maggie with this calamine lotion and the scabbing will heal.</p>
<p>The scabbing will heal!</p>
<p>(All) The scabbing will heal!</p>
<p>Heal my scabs, Lord.</p>
<p>Praise the Lord! I can walk again!</p>
<p>Hmm...</p>
<p>What? My foot fell asleep.</p>
<p>(SCOFFS) Sweetie, I know it itches.</p>
<p>But you've got to stop scratching.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>(GASPS) No!</p>
<p>Here. Here, play with your teddy bear.</p>
<p>(GROANS) Sugar booger.</p>
<p>Aww, poor Maggie.</p>
<p>(GASPS) Homer, don't touch her. You've never had chicken pox.</p>
<p>I know. And you did. And you're great.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm just saying it's very dangerous if you get it as an adult.</p>
<p>It can leave you sterile.</p>
<p>Down there.</p>
<p>(SCOFFS) You always gotta work blue, don't you, Marge?</p>
<p>You're better than that.</p>
<p>Can't even go in my own kitchen.</p>
<p>Bet Bart's in there right now licking frosting off my b*at!</p>
<p>Mmm. Don't worry, Dad. I'm saving one for you.</p>
<p>(LAUGHS) I'll just leave it here in the dog's mouth.</p>
<p>No! Bart!</p>
<p>That's a really bad storage area.</p>
<p>Hey, Homer. Why the sour puss?</p>
<p>Did you chug-a-lug a skunky Snapple?</p>
<p>I don't know. Maybe.</p>
<p>Plus, my wife won't let me inside because the baby's got chicken pox.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Do you mind if I bring my boys over so she can infect Rod and Todd?</p>
<p>Then there'll be a pox on both our houses.</p>
<p>Why would you do that? Are you a bad parent?</p>
<p><em>Au contraire,</em> man with no hair.</p>
<p>You see, Rod and Todd could only get the chicken pox once, and childhood's the safest time.</p>
<p>So you want Maggie to infect your kids?</p>
<p>You betcha!</p>
<p>In fact, some parents have been known to hold &quot;pox parties&quot; so other kids in the neighborhood can get the disease when they please.</p>
<p>And would they pay handsomely for the privilege?</p>
<p>They might.</p>
<p>You'd have to be awfully money-grubbing to charge your friends and neighbors.</p>
<p>$15 to infect your kids!</p>
<p>Now featuring the pox box!</p>
<p>Pox box not recommended for pregnant or nursing women.</p>
<p>As with any disease box, results may vary.</p>
<p>Pox box!</p>
<p>Welcome to our pox party.</p>
<p>Save room for punch. Maggie's bathing in the bowl.</p>
<p>(DOORBELL RINGS)</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Luann'll pick up Milhouse when the party's over.</p>
<p>I'll just read in the car till then.</p>
<p>Oh, Kirk. Come join the parents in the kitchen.</p>
<p>We're having alcohol drinks and dishing on the parents who aren't here.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, I'm not the one to laugh at a man's urinary blockage but you should've seen...</p>
<p>Oh! There he is.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the sister with the blisters, the tot with all the spots, Maggie!</p>
<p>(COUGHING)</p>
<p>I feel like a chicken already.</p>
<p>I just made an egg in my pants.</p>
<p>Hey, Marge.</p>
<p>Hit me with a little hit more of that silly slush.</p>
<p>Chief, don't you think you've had enough?</p>
<p>I'm fine. Watch, I can even touch my g*n to my nose.</p>
<p>(BOTH GASPING)</p>
<p>Don't worry. I'm the &quot;pief of cholice.&quot;</p>
<p>I mean, I'm the beef with no cheese.</p>
<p>(SOBS) Why doesn't Lou like me? Why?</p>
<p>Knock-knock.</p>
<p>Luann? What are you doing here?</p>
<p>I thought you were just dropping Milhouse off.</p>
<p>I could get some coffee and come back.</p>
<p>No, no, no. You stay. I'll just drive home.</p>
<p>Uh, who's gonna let me siphon?</p>
<p>Why don't you both stay and have one of my Marge-aritas?</p>
<p>All right!</p>
<p>I never drank one of these without a cigarette in it.</p>
<p>Now kids, in lieu of one of those inflatable jumping things, please welcome Mr. Krusty the Clown!</p>
<p>(ALL CHEERING)</p>
<p>Hey, hey, kids!</p>
<p>(LAUGHS)</p>
<p>This putz only paid for 20 seconds so listen fast.</p>
<p>Moishe caught the chicken pox, he scratched all night and day.</p>
<p>He asked the rabbi what to do and he said... (BEEPS)</p>
<p>Time! I'm outta here!</p>
<p>(LAUGHS)</p>
<p>(TIRES SCREECHING)</p>
<p>Kirk, you look good. Have you been working out?</p>
<p>Well, dogs have been chasing me.</p>
<p>No one's been chasing me lately.</p>
<p>What happened to your last boyfriend?</p>
<p>The one who would always go to the gym after visiting you, then have lunch at that place downtown?</p>
<p>You know, his taillight's broken?</p>
<p>I'm not seeing him anymore.</p>
<p>Does that mean that there might be a chance for me?</p>
<p>Almost anyone's got a chance now.</p>
<p>(ALL COUGHING)</p>
<p>Goodbye. Thanks for coming.</p>
<p>If my party made you sick, tell your friends.</p>
<p>(MOANING)</p>
<p>Sweet Lizzie McGuire!</p>
<p>You think that's traumatic?</p>
<p>Mr. Stomach, are you hungry?</p>
<p>&quot;I'm always hungry, now make with the pizza, fatso.&quot;</p>
<p>(LAUGHS)</p>
<p>You're the stomach.</p>
<p>I have to do this for work.</p>
<p>So Milhouse walks into the bedroom and there's his morn and dad going...</p>
<p>(MIMICKING MOANS)</p>
<p>(IN HIGH PITCHED VOICE) &quot;Oh, Mr. Van Houten, I love when you kiss me.&quot;</p>
<p>(IN LOW VOICE) &quot;Yeah, yeah, kissing ladies is the best.&quot;</p>
<p>(IN HIGH PITCHED VOICE) &quot;Oh, baby, kiss my mouth.&quot;</p>
<p>(IN LOW VOICE) &quot;Kiss me like we're in a fancy hotel.&quot;</p>
<p>All right, we get ii.</p>
<p>(WHIMPERING) Marge, what's happening to me?</p>
<p>Oh, Homie, you got chicken pox. But how?</p>
<p>I don't know. I kept away from Maggie all day.</p>
<p>Uh!</p>
<p>I'm so itchy!</p>
<p>(CHOKING)</p>
<p>Oh! Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Son, we want to talk to you about what you saw in the Simpsons' house.</p>
<p>Well, I didn't see anything to get my hopes up, if that's what you mean.</p>
<p>Well, maybe you should get your hopes up a little.</p>
<p>They're already up! They're sky high!</p>
<p>Your father and I are going through what's called a trial un-separation.</p>
<p>And son, I want to make one thing clear.</p>
<p>Unlike the breakup, this is not your fault.</p>
<p>I can't believe it! Our family might get back together again!</p>
<p>(SINGING) <em>Our house is a very, very, very fine house.</p>
<p>With two cats in the yard.</p>
<p>Life used to be so hard.</p>
<p>Now everything is easy 'cause of you.</p>
<p>And our la, la, la</em></p>
<p>(BOTH LAUGHING)</p>
<p>(SIGHS)</p>
<p>I haven't daydreamed in color in so long.</p>
<p>Thank God. We were afraid we lost you, son.</p>
<p>You sit in this oatmeal awhile and it'll send your itchies packin'.</p>
<p>Homer!</p>
<p>Mmm!</p>
<p>Homer oats.</p>
<p>Stop eating the oatmeal. That's the third tub you've eaten.</p>
<p>(PHONE RINGING)</p>
<p>Y'ello? No. I'm not coming in to work. I have chicken pox.</p>
<p>I know I said that last month, but I was lying.</p>
<p>Jeez.</p>
<p>Right. Right. Right. Right! Okay.</p>
<p>Right. I love you. Bye.</p>
<p>I just got fired. Better check the want ads.</p>
<p>Ooh! Truck driver needed in lraq.</p>
<p>Trucks are like big cars.</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>Okay, Luann, for honesty's sake, we should probably talk about everyone we dated while we were separated.</p>
<p>Well, the Sea Captain and I...</p>
<p>Yeah, okay. I don't want to know.</p>
<p>I don't want to know. I don't want to know.</p>
<p>So what are we gonna do as a family today?</p>
<p>Mini golf, pedal boats, indoor rock wall?</p>
<p>Um, Milly...</p>
<p>Botanical garden, build a bear workshop, arena football with the Springfield Stun?</p>
<p>Not today, big guy.</p>
<p>Your dad and I need more time to get reacquainted.</p>
<p>(BOTH CHUCKLING)</p>
<p>Why are you laughing? Tell me!</p>
<p>Private jokes are rude.</p>
<p>Uh, son, here's 10 bucks.</p>
<p>Why don't you go to the bowling alley and throw some solo balls?</p>
<p>But it's league night.</p>
<p>(GROANS) This trial un-separation stinks!</p>
<p>My parents used to compete for my love and I'd cash in every time.</p>
<p>And I always got the spillover.</p>
<p>Drive-in movies, two Christmases, soda with dinner.</p>
<p>(SIGHS) We lived like kings.</p>
<p>Remember when you told my dad to go to bed and he did?</p>
<p>That was some New Year's.</p>
<p>Now listen. I think we should consider breaking your parents up again.</p>
<p>I don't know, Bart. I've wanted them back together for so long.</p>
<p>Look, you know they're gonna separate again.</p>
<p>Why don't we just speed up the process?</p>
<p>You know, Bart.</p>
<p>My imaginary friend never made me do things I thought were wrong.</p>
<p>That's why he had to go away forever.</p>
<p>I thought you were gonna let him come back!</p>
<p>I'm afraid he has to spend another year searching for his brain.</p>

<p>Luann! I'm moving my stuff back in!</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>Dad, Mom says you're stinky and gross!</p>
<p>Your mother said that?</p>
<p>This is so great.</p>
<p>I mean, she used to keep her criticisms all bottled up until they destroyed our marriage.</p>
<p>And I guess I am a little funky.</p>
<p>Well, this is what cologne samples are for.</p>
<p>(HUMMING)</p>
<p>(SIGHS)</p>
<p>Mom, I don't want to get Dad in trouble, but he just let me drink a beer!</p>
<p>Hmm, looks like we have a problem here.</p>
<p>The problem being that you are addicted to fibbing. lam drunk! I'll prove it! Watch me kiss this picture of Nana!</p>
<p>I can't do it! She's so mean to me!</p>
<p>She wouldn't let me eat Froot Loops!</p>
<p>Maybe my mom and dad are meant to be together, Bart.</p>
<p>You'd better hope not, 'cause you know what comes next?</p>
<p>Your worst nightmare. A baby sister.</p>
<p>Hi, Bart. I baked you some cookies.</p>
<p>Skanks for nothing, Lame-orella.</p>
<p>If you two don't mind, I'd like to watch that cool Fox show about teenagers in Orange County.</p>
<p>(HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING)</p>
<p><em>Austin, I was looking for my belly ring in your recording studio and I found this!</em></p>
<p>Does this or does this not belong to Feather?</p>
<p>Sorry, Jade. That's how we light it up in the OC.</p>
<p>You cheated on me! Our mixed-race fling is so over!</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>Let's score some jam at Knott's Berry Farm.</p>
<p>For sure, dawg.</p>
<p>We'll be kickin' it old-school at Bigfoot Rapids.</p>
<p>Gonna get my flume on, log-style!</p>

<p>I bet that bra was planted by Sterling to break them up.</p>
<p>That's a brilliant idea! Those TV writers are geniuses!</p>
<p>Whatever they' re paid, it's not enough.</p>
<p>This bra is really gonna lift and separate.</p>
<p>Lift your mother's suspicions and separate your parents.</p>
<p>(Luann) Milhouse, I need slender fingers to get me a pickle.</p>
<p>This isn't mine.</p>
<p>(BOTH GIGGLING)</p>
<p>I have a message for your wife.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop sleeping with my husband.&quot;</p>
<p>Okay-doke!</p>
<p>And you are? The wife of your wife's lover.</p>
<p>Does she know what this is regarding?</p>
<p>(SCOFFS) You moron! Marge is having an affair with Kirk!</p>
<p>(LAUGHS) That's ridiculous.</p>
<p>No woman would want to have sex with that loser.</p>
<p>(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)</p>
<p>And, uh, congratulations on snagging him back. Good stuff.</p>
<p>Just answer me one question.</p>
<p>How did your wife's bra end up in my husband's bed? (GRUNTS)</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>This is Marge's bra.</p>
<p>I bought it for her boobs.</p>
<p>Of all the people for Marge to cheat on, why did it have to be me?</p>
<p>Oh, boy, am I b*at.</p>
<p>If you want to return a melon to the grocery store, clear your day.</p>
<p>Well, that answers the mystery of the missing melon.</p>
<p>But I have one more question.</p>
<p>Did you sleep with Kirk Van Houten?</p>
<p>(GASPS) How could you ask me that?</p>
<p>I repeat. Did you sleep with Kirk?</p>
<p>Homer, you're crazy.</p>
<p>You're not saying &quot;no&quot;.</p>
<p>Fine. No.</p>
<p>I'm still not hearing &quot;no.&quot;</p>
<p>No, no, no!</p>
<p>Well, methinks the lady doth protest too much.</p>
<p>You don't trust me?</p>
<p>After I salved every chicken pock on your ungrateful body?</p>
<p>How dare you?</p>
<p>I'm still waiting for that &quot;no.&quot;</p>
<p>Get out of this house! Gladly!</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>We tried to break up your parents and we broke up mine!</p>
<p>Wanna call my therapist to tell her how you feel?</p>
<p>Hello, Dr. Wexler?</p>

<p>I thought Mom kicked you out of the house!</p>
<p>I came to get my mail.</p>
<p>&quot;Resident.&quot; &quot;Occupant.&quot; I can't open these.</p>
<p>Ooh! A traffic ticket!</p>
<p>I'd do anything to get your mother and that donut back.</p>
<p>Okay, look, you and Mom can fix this.</p>
<p>What exactly happened between the two of you?</p>
<p>Lisa, we don't need to know how.</p>
<p>It's a natural thing that happens, like a hurricane or going to w*r.</p>
<p>Hmm...</p>
<p>Well, I'd better go.</p>
<p>Where are you staying?</p>
<p>You know the Four Seasons?</p>
<p>Well, I'm experiencing them firsthand because I'm living in the park.</p>
<p>Bart, I think you're behind this whole thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can see how you'd think that.</p>
<p>But on the other hand...</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>Ha! I can read you like a book.</p>
<p>Ha-ha. You read books.</p>
<p>If you don't tell Mom what you did, I will.</p>
<p>AW, come on.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be easier if our parents divorced and you compensated by marrying much older men?</p>
<p>And meanwhile, I'll be one of those weird guys who's 35 and shows up at high school basketball games.</p>
<p>(SIGHS)</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>Why did I marry that selfish jerk?</p>
<p>I've asked him to flip the mattress a thousand times and he never does.</p>
<p>(GRUNTING)</p>
<p>Uh, Mom? Hi, sweetie.</p>
<p>Uh, you know that bra that broke up our family?</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Well, I looked into it, and it turns out I was responsible.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Well, just for that, I'm gonna erase all the saved games on your PlayStation.</p>
<p>What? How do you know about things like that?</p>
<p>I learned about it in here.</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>But Dad can come home, right? No!</p>
<p>But he's innocent. Innocent?</p>
<p>After all I do for your father, he still doesn't trust me.</p>
<p>I'm finished with him!</p>
<p>Does this mean you and Dad might get a D-A-V-U-R-S?</p>
<p>Young man, you go work on your spelling or I'll delete all the custom ring tones from your cell phone.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>(SIGHS) Our reverse Parent Trap just made everything worse.</p>
<p>Maybe we should use a different movie <em>as</em> our guide.</p>
<p>Like Oklahoma![/i]</p>
<p>(SINGING) <em>Oh, the farmer and the cowman should be friends.</p>
<p>Oh, the farmer and the cowman should be friends.</p>
<p>One man likes to push a plow.</p>
<p>The other likes to chase a cow.</p>
<p>But that's no reason why they can't be friends</em></p>
<p>What do you think, Bart? A hoedown could solve all our problems.</p>
<p>I just need your chap size. it's two more than your pant size.</p>
<p>How many times do I have to tell you no Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein?</p>
<p>Rodgers and Hart? No!</p>
<p>Well, what will trick your parents into getting back together?</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: Enough with the tricks!</p>
<p>Stupid movie schemes do not work in real life!</p>
<p>Mom and Dad have a marriage on the rocks.</p>
<p>And they need to work through it in therapy to make sure it doesn't shatter.</p>
<p>Rocks. Shatter. Jagged cliff!</p>
<p>Lise, you've just given me an idea for the most insane, harebrained, foolproof scheme ever!</p>
<p>(SIGHS)</p>
<p>Okay, when my mom and dad see this dummy fall in the river, they'll think it's me.</p>
<p>And they'll realize what really matters. Each other.</p>
<p>Do you like the dummy, Bart?</p>
<p>I even made it smell like you.</p>
<p>Now make sure Homer and Marge are in proper viewing position.</p>
<p>So I got your note saying you wanted to meet here to apologize.</p>
<p>Well, I got your note saying you were gonna bring me a bucket of potato salad.</p>
<p>Where's my apology?</p>
<p>Where's my bucket?</p>
<p>Now I'll get Mom and Dad's attention and you shove the dummy in the water.</p>
<p>Any questions? Yeah.</p>
<p>What are you going as for Halloween?</p>
<p>Pile of dog doo. Let's roll.</p>
<p>Mom! Dad! I'm playing on a dangerous cliff because you're too busy arguing to pay attention to me!</p>
<p>(GASPS)</p>
<p>Bart! We're all disappointed there's no potato salad!</p>
<p>But for God's sake, don’t jump!</p>
<p>Now!</p>
<p>I can't tell which is which.</p>
<p>Oh, no! I'm already running!</p>
<p>(GRUNTS)</p>
<p>(GROANS)</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>I did it, Bart!</p>
<p>Bart?</p>
<p>(SCREAMING)</p>
<p>I'm a-comin', boy!</p>
<p>(BOTH SCREAMING)</p>
<p>(HUMMING)</p>
<p>(WHIMPERING)</p>
<p>This is all my fault.</p>
<p>I planted Mom's bra on Milhouse's parents' bed.</p>
<p>Why, you little...</p>
<p>(CHOKING)</p>
<p>Homer, I can save you both. Just let go of the rock.</p>
<p>Just do it! Trust me!</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>(ALL BREATHING HEAVILY)</p>
<p>Mom, Dad, I'd give a kajillion dollars for you to get back together!</p>
<p>Make it two kajillion. Homer!</p>
<p>We'll lose the first kajillion to taxes.</p>
<p>Well, I guess you showed you do trust me after all.</p>
<p>Of course I do.</p>
<p>The only thing I can't believe is that a woman as great as you would be married to me.</p>
<p>Aw, Homie...</p>
<p>(Milhouse) I don't want to live in a world without Bart!</p>
<p>(GAS PS)</p>
<p>Can he swim?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>(SINGING) <em>California!</p>
<p>California!</p>
<p>Here we come!</p>
<p>California!</p>
<p>Here we come!</p>
<p>California!</p>
<p>Here we come!</em></p>
