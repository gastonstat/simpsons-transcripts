<p>This place is gonna smell classy all week.</p>
<p>To Homer, the Wall Street genius!</p>
<p>Hey, Homer, how come you got money to burn? Or singe, anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah, what's your secret investment?</p>
<p>Take a guess.</p>
<p>Pumpkins?</p>
<p>Yeah, that's right, Barney. This year, I invested in pumpkins.</p>
<p>They've been going up the whole month of October.</p>
<p>And I got a feeling they're gonna peak right around January.</p>
<p>And bang! That's when I'll cash in.</p>
<p>To Homer! And to Sergeant Pepper... who's growing out of the middle of your back!</p>
<p>Barn, you gotta unwrap the plastic before you smoke these.</p>
<p>Hey, Homer.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Hey, Homer.</p>
<p>Way to go.</p>
<p>I told you a hundred times, you gotta sell your pumpkin futures before Halloween.</p>
<p>Let's not panic. I'll make the money back by selling a liver.</p>
<p>I can get by with one.</p>
<p>Oh, how am I gonna tell Marge we're broke?</p>
<p>I need a miracle.</p>
<p>My house is on fire!</p>
<p>Insurance to the rescue!</p>
<p>Hello, Homer.</p>
<p>Hello, Homer.</p>
<p>Marge, we had a deal.</p>
<p>Your sisters don't come here after 6, and I stop eating your lipstick.</p>
<p>This is a special occasion.</p>
<p>Patty and Selma just got promoted at the DMV.</p>
<p>Yeah, Homer. Let your wife have a glimpse of success for once.</p>
<p>All right, that's the last straw.</p>
<p>Time to take out the trash!</p>
<p>But first, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. Homer doesn't mean to be rude.</p>
<p>He's just a very complicated man.</p>
<p>Wrong!</p>
<p>When are you going to wake up and smell your husband, Marge?</p>
<p>You got some kids out of him.</p>
<p>But when the seeds have been planted, you throw away the envelope.</p>
<p>I wish you wouldn't put Homer down. He may not be a big success like you... but I can always count on him to provide for the family.</p>
<p>Sweet, trusting Marge, I can't let you down. I'll get some money somehow.</p>
<p>Hello, Vegas? Give me a hundred bucks on red.</p>
<p>All right. I'll send you a check.</p>
<p>If only I could think of an invention.</p>
<p>Something that would really make money.</p>
<p>Must concentrate and work harder than I've ever worked...</p>
<p>Congratulations, Mr. Simpson.</p>
<p>This invention of yours has made us all rich, especially you.</p>
<p>It's simple, yet ingenious. And it fits right in the palm of your hand.</p>
<p>Every person in America now owns one of these. In many cases, three or four.</p>
<p>Can I just get a look at that?</p>
<p>Why would you need to see it? You're the genius who invented the product.</p>
<p>But could I just...?</p>
<p>Don't worry.</p>
<p>You'll get to see it just as soon as we unveil our new ad campaign.</p>
<p>Let me see! Out of the way!</p>
<p>Homer!</p>
<p>Homer, wake up! There's still a few minutes till our usual bedtime.</p>
<p>No! My invention!</p>
<p>My money problems could've...</p>
<p>Money problems?</p>
<p>Homer, are we in some sort of fiduciary trouble?</p>
<p>Oh, Marge, my loyal wife... of course not.</p>
<p>And Lisa, my little princess.</p>
<p>And who could forget dear Rat Boy?</p>
<p>Rat Boy? I resent that.</p>
<p>Bart, I told you before. Stop gnawing on the drywall.</p>
<p>What a day, eh, Milhouse? The sun is out, birds are singing... bees are trying to have sex with them, as I understand it.</p>
<p>It is a gorgeously fabulous day. Marvelous, even.</p>
<p>So, what's your hurry to get to school?</p>
<p>Nothing. What's your hurry?</p>
<p>That's enough, Bart. Fun is fun, but if we're late, we'll get in trouble.</p>
<p>You're right, Milhouse. Fun is fun.</p>
<p>Attention, students. It's time to choose a gym class for the coming term.</p>
<p>So let's prove how adult we can be... by filing to the gym in a calm, orderly manner.</p>
<p>Even though it's first come, first serve, and the popular sports fill up fast.</p>
<p>Too many wee ones!</p>
<p>This gets uglier every year. Any sign of Bart and Milhouse?</p>
<p>No, and if they don't get here soon, it'll be T.S. For them.</p>
<p>I don't feel right.</p>
<p>Do you hear that, Bart? That was the tardy bell!</p>
<p>&quot;Truant! Truant! Truant!&quot; They'll all say!</p>
<p>Who needs him? I can have fun all by myself.</p>
<p>It's all right? It's all right. It's all right? It's all right.</p>
<p>Sure, Homer, I can loan you the money you need.</p>
<p>However, since you have no collateral... I'm gonna have to break your legs in advance.</p>
<p>Gosh, Moe. I use these all the time.</p>
<p>Couldn't you bash my head in?</p>
<p>Hey, are you a loan shark?</p>
<p>Do you understand how finance works?</p>
<p>Now, let's do this thing.</p>
<p>Oh, no. It's P.E. Sign-up day.</p>
<p>How could you forget?</p>
<p>They had signs posted all over the library.</p>
<p>Better sign up for something fast, man. Baseball just filled up...</p>
<p>So did tae kwon do.</p>
<p>There's only one class left... but it happens to be the coolest one of all.</p>
<p>Ballet? Dancing is for girls.</p>
<p>Well, you should've gotten here earlier.</p>
<p>I need an extension on my mortgage payments.</p>
<p>I understand, Mr. Simpson, but according to our computer... your credit history is not good.</p>
<p>It says here that you've been pre-declined for every major credit card.</p>
<p>It also says that you grabbed a dog by the hind legs... and pushed him like a vacuum.</p>
<p>In the third grade!</p>
<p>It all goes on your permanent record.</p>
<p>Sorry, but if you don't have that money by tomorrow... the bank will take your house.</p>
<p>Good luck finding it.</p>
<p>I'll take the numbers off.</p>
<p>We'll find a house with no numbers.</p>
<p>I'll take off my neighbor's numbers.</p>
<p>So then we'll look for the house next to the house with no numbers.</p>
<p>All right, you'll get your money.</p>
<p>You're my last, last chance, bottom of the barrel, Hail Mary, long sh*t... wish you would, but probably won't, final resort to lend me money.</p>
<p>We'll take care of you.</p>
<p>Yes. Care.</p>
<p>Cut him a check and get him the hell out of here.</p>
<p>What a wonderful dinner. What a beautiful family.</p>
<p>Get a picture of me with this steak.</p>
<p>You're certainly in a good mood, Dad.</p>
<p>Well, Lisa, I managed to solve a little problem today.</p>
<p>And to celebrate, I'm going to tilt my chair.</p>
<p>Slanty.</p>
<p>Patty, Selma. What are you doing here?</p>
<p>We thought we'd stop by unexpectedly for dinner.</p>
<p>Now, bring us extra chairs like a good &quot;blubber&quot;-in-law.</p>
<p>Time to fertilize the lawn.</p>
<p>A couple of 500-pound bags should do it!</p>
<p>Be careful with my sisters' heads. Their necks are brittle.</p>
<p>That's okay, Marge. Nothing's broke.</p>
<p>Except Homer.</p>
<p>What's that supposed to mean?</p>
<p>It means...</p>
<p>It means these two fabulous babes are staying for dinner.</p>
<p>Now, there's a stink I could've done without.</p>
<p>This has been such a nice, peaceful dinner.</p>
<p>It calls for a celebration. I'll make the most international coffee in the house: Montreal Morn.</p>
<p>All right, you had your fun, now get lost.</p>
<p>Our fun hasn't g*n yet.</p>
<p>We know something you don't want Marge to know.</p>
<p>Now we own you, like Siegfried owns Roy.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. All we have is Nescafé.</p>
<p>I'm very, very sorry.</p>
<p>Oh, Marge, Marge. You're just in time.</p>
<p>Homer's getting ready to give us a foot rub.</p>
<p>You are?</p>
<p>No! L...</p>
<p>I'm giving them a foot massage.</p>
<p>At least let me have that.</p>
<p>You can start with the corns.</p>
<p>Then you can move on to bunion country.</p>
<p>Okay. Steady, Bart.</p>
<p>Taking ballet doesn't make you any less of a man.</p>
<p>All right, girls. Today we learn the dance of the fairy queens.</p>
<p>You can either be a fairy or a queen. It's wide open.</p>
<p>And what have we here?</p>
<p>A young man maybe who thinks he can be the next Baryshnikov.</p>
<p>I don't wanna be the next anything. They made me take this stupid class.</p>
<p>So he has fire in the belly. But it will take more than belly fire... to be the next Baryshnikov!</p>
<p>Look, Boris, I think ballet's for sissies.</p>
<p>Ballet is for the strong, the fierce, the determined.</p>
<p>But for the sissies, never.</p>
<p>Now, put on this fuchsia-tard. You are a fairy!</p>
<p>Quitting time.</p>
<p>On the way home... we'll stop at Moe's for a Zima.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll stay and work overtime.</p>
<p>My sisters-in-law are at my house again.</p>
<p>Homer, quit wallowing in self-pity.</p>
<p>Pull yourself together and come get drunk with us.</p>
<p>Is something wrong, Mr. Simpson?</p>
<p>I don't like wearing tights.</p>
<p>But so many of your heroes wear tights.</p>
<p>Batman, for example. And Magellan.</p>
<p>Look, I don't like this cootie platoon... and I never will. I'm out of here, and I'm out of this stupid outfit.</p>
<p>Wait! Joy of movement, increasing.</p>
<p>Love of dance, impossible to resist.</p>
<p>Toes twinkling. Look at me, girls.</p>
<p>I'm doing ballet. And I love it!</p>
<p>Am I wrong, or did it just get fatter in here?</p>
<p>Request permission to slink by.</p>
<p>Permission pending.</p>
<p>First, light our cigarettes.</p>
<p>But you're already smoking cig...</p>
<p>You're really pushing it.</p>
<p>Come on, Homer.</p>
<p>You can't spell &quot;obsequious&quot; without l-O-U.</p>
<p>I'll have to trust you on that.</p>
<p>Marge was always a good speller.</p>
<p>Let's ask her.</p>
<p><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content"><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle transcripts-topic-in-post" style="display:inline-block" data-full-width-responsive="true" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3808023418243141" data-ad-slot="1728561479"></ins>
<p><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div></p>
<p>No! Don't tell Marge!</p>
<p>I'll be good. I'll be good.</p>
<p>Just for that, you have to crawl around on the floor like the dog you are.</p>
<p>But... Yes, ma'am.</p>
<p>Now say, &quot;I am Homer Simpson, the lowly dog. &quot; In a dog voice!</p>
<p>I am Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>Well, good. Jump, Homer, jump.</p>
<p>What's going on in here?</p>
<p>Absolutely nothing, Marge.</p>
<p>What's that paper?</p>
<p>What paper?</p>
<p>Homer, is this projection accurate?</p>
<p>Did you borrow money from my sisters?</p>
<p>I don't know, Marge.</p>
<p>I can't keep track of all my wheelings and dealings.</p>
<p>He blew your savings on jack-o'-lanterns.</p>
<p>You told!</p>
<p>Sorry, Marge.</p>
<p>I never want to see you again! You either.</p>
<p>Homer. Homer, why didn't you tell me?</p>
<p>I was ashamed, Marge. I failed you as a husband and a provider.</p>
<p>And at best, I was a B-plus dog.</p>
<p>I'll understand if you wanna sleep on the couch tonight.</p>
<p>How's Dad today?</p>
<p>Not too good, Lisa.</p>
<p>Frankly, he's underneath the table.</p>
<p>Nobody make me any breakfast.</p>
<p>A man so deeply in debt doesn't deserve it.</p>
<p>But I like to make you breakfast.</p>
<p>In that case, I'll just have French toast with double butter and a side of bacon.</p>
<p>But no powdered sugar, I don't deserve it. Maybe a little powdered sugar.</p>
<p>See that? I started to do, like, a little arabesque.</p>
<p>But then I just fully went for it and pulled off the demi-entrechat.</p>
<p>Not that I'm into that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Bravissimo, Bart! Next week, class gives its first recital.</p>
<p>And you, you will dance the male lead.</p>
<p>Dance in front of my whole school? What is it with you and ballet?</p>
<p>I know you have great conflict, Bart. You love ballet.</p>
<p>Yet you feel the boys will laugh at you, no?</p>
<p>No, I fear the girls will laugh at me.</p>
<p>I fear the boys will b*at the snot out of me.</p>
<p>Hey, Dad. What you doing?</p>
<p>Daddy has very important work to do.</p>
<p>He's looking through the want ads to find a part-time job.</p>
<p>Dad, that's a gag paper we got at the carnival.</p>
<p>No wonder I didn't hear about Bart being elected world's greatest sex machine.</p>
<p>I'll never pay off that debt!</p>
<p>Need money fast?</p>
<p>Got no experience? Step up to elegance.</p>
<p>Become a limo driver at Classy Joe's.</p>
<p>That's it!</p>
<p>I'll make money with a chauffeur job! Good thing you turned on that TV, Lisa.</p>
<p>I didn't turn it on, I thought you did.</p>
<p>No. Well, anyway, turn it off.</p>
<p>It is off.</p>
<p>You have to work hard to win this crowd over.</p>
<p>Most of them are here for detention.</p>
<p>Pretty big crowd.</p>
<p>We even bused in troublemakers from other schools.</p>
<p>That spiky-haired, masked dancer is really something.</p>
<p>I wonder who he is.</p>
<p>He's graceful, yet masculine.</p>
<p>So it's okay for me to enjoy this.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the movie Fame, and to a lesser extent... the TV series, which was also called Fame.</p>
<p>Oh, wow, I can't believe my very first passenger is comedy legend Mel Brooks.</p>
<p>I loved that movie Young Frankenstein. Scared the hell out of me.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Let's do that 2000-pound-man thing.</p>
<p>I'll be that Carl Reiner guy, and you be what's-his-face.</p>
<p>It's not easy. It takes the genius of Carl Reiner... and the timing that only we...</p>
<p>Sir, today, every country has a national anthem.</p>
<p>Did they have national anthems 2000 years ago?</p>
<p>Sure! Sure we had. Of course, we was caves.</p>
<p>But every cave had a national anthem.</p>
<p>I'll never forget my cave's national anthem.</p>
<p>What was that national anthem?</p>
<p>Let them all go to hell except Cave 76</p>
<p>What's with the si...? What's with the siren?</p>
<p>Evening, Simpson. Got a short in your taillight.</p>
<p>Started blinking when you made that turn.</p>
<p>Let's see your chauffeur's license.</p>
<p>Chauffeur's license, eh?</p>
<p>Mel, buckle your borscht belt!</p>
<p>Since you're trying to make a getaway in park... I'm guessing you don't have a license.</p>
<p>Better head to the DMV. These two broads'll help you out.</p>
<p>Wow. Officer, this man is making me a little edgy.</p>
<p>Could you give me a ride to the airport?</p>
<p>Hey, hey! You're Mel Brooks!</p>
<p>Sure, I'll give you a ride.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>On the way we can do that 2000-dollar-man thing.</p>
<p>You be Carl Reiner, and I'll be Police Chief Wiggum.</p>
<p>Listen, why don't you play Carl Reiner, and let me play Police Chief Wiggum.</p>
<p>I hate Carl Reiner!</p>
<p>I haven't been moved like this since The Joy Luck Club.</p>
<p>They love me. I'm accepted. I don 't need this mask anymore.</p>
<p>Behold! The masked dancer is me, Bart!</p>
<p>It is I who have won your acclaim!</p>
<p>Bart does ballet!</p>
<p>He dances like girls!</p>
<p>Go ahead and laugh. I took a chance and did what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>And if that makes me a sissy, well, then, I guess I'm a sissy.</p>
<p>He's a sissy! Let's rush him!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Yeah, let's get him, come on!</p>
<p>After him! Go!</p>
<p>There he is! There, right there!</p>
<p>Bart, use the ballet. Leap!</p>
<p>Leap like you've never leapt before!</p>
<p>Looks like he took a pretty bad spill.</p>
<p>Well, as long as he's hurt.</p>
<p>Bart, I am so proud of you. You've shown a sensitive side of yourself... that can never be erased. From this day forward, we are kindred spirits.</p>
<p>Why'd she just leave me here when I clearly need medical attention?</p>
<p>Stupid driving test at the stupid DMV... where stupid Patty and stupid Selma work.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think God is teasing me, just like he teased Moses in the desert.</p>
<p>Tested, Homer. God tested Moses. And try to be nice to my sisters.</p>
<p>It's very hard on me to have you always fighting.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, Marge. I'll get along with them.</p>
<p>Then I will hug some snakes.</p>
<p>Yes! I will hug and kiss some poisonous snakes!</p>
<p>Now, that's sarcasm.</p>
<p>Well, well, well. Look who needs us again... to get his chauffeur's license.</p>
<p>Look, all I ask is that you be fair.</p>
<p>Did not adjust side mirror. Minus one point.</p>
<p>Failed to check blind spot. Minus two points.</p>
<p>You'll be happy when my family thinks I'm a loser.</p>
<p>You are a loser, Homer! And we're winners. You gotta learn that.</p>
<p>Seat belt twisted. Minus one point.</p>
<p>Nagging the driver. Minus 10 points for you!</p>
<p>Grazed a cone. Minus five.</p>
<p>Being a jerk. Minus a million!</p>
<p>One more wrong answer, and Homer flunks another of life's little tests.</p>
<p>And what's this?</p>
<p>Someone didn't fill in a circle all the way.</p>
<p>Oh, boy. Oh, that felt good.</p>
<p>Let me try. Let me try.</p>
<p>Yeah. Oh, boy. Oh, that was so sweet.</p>
<p>So, Homer, how'd you do?</p>
<p>Well, I...</p>
<p>Ladies, please don't tell me you're smoking in a government building.</p>
<p>Because that is the kind of infraction... that can cost a couple of sisters their promotion.</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You mean...</p>
<p>Why...</p>
<p>Oh, you're talking about she... Who's? What? She... What, this?</p>
<p>I'll never forgive myself for this.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Those are yours, sir?</p>
<p>Yes. I am in flavor country.</p>
<p>Both of them?</p>
<p>It's a big country.</p>
<p>Ladies, I apologize. And you, sir, are worse than h*tler.</p>
<p>Homer, I'm... I'm speechless.</p>
<p>You just saved our hides.</p>
<p>On top of everything else... don't make me picture your hides.</p>
<p>It's a wonderful thing you did... for my sisters.</p>
<p>I didn't do it for them.</p>
<p>I did it for you, Marge. I'd k*ll for you.</p>
<p>Please ask me to k*ll for you.</p>
<p>No, Homie.</p>
<p>You see? This is the stuff I've been telling you about that you never see.</p>
<p>Homer.</p>
<p>We're... sorry.</p>
<p>Lf there's anything we can do...</p>
<p>Call off the debt?</p>
<p>Or, say, we could let you pass your driver's test.</p>
<p>Call off the debt?</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>Debt's off! Let's go, Marge!</p>
