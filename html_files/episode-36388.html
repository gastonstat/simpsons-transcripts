<p>No one's here today.   </p>
<p>Even the choir's late.   </p>

<p>♪ <em>Traffic school them.</em> ♪   </p>
<p>- (SIREN WAILING)<br />
- Yeah.   </p>
<p>Mom, with all the room, do we have to sit so close to the geezers?   </p>
<p>- It's too hot.<br />
- It's too cold.   </p>
<p>I'm not even alive.   </p>
<p>What time does Joan Rivers come on?   </p>
<p>She doesn't.   </p>
<p>This is a church, and it's not your church.   </p>
<p><em>New</em> Testament?   </p>
<p>Oy-yoi-yoi, when did this happen?   </p>
<p>Alexa, play Tranquil Organ Radio.   </p>
<p>(ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING)   </p>
<p>Peace be with you.   </p>
<p>ALL: And also with you.   </p>
<p>Oh, you can do better than that.   </p>
<p>ALL: We can, but we don't want to.   </p>
<p>I can't hear you.   </p>
<p>ALL: You clearly can.   </p>
<p>Lord, either make this interesting or just rapture me now.   </p>

<p>Oh, sorry. You know what?   </p>
<p>Here. Have a quarter, Chief.   </p>
<p>You think you can bribe me with a...?<br />
Oh, my God!   </p>
<p>Those are the gentlest eyes I've ever seen.   </p>
<p>Linen shirt. Natural highlights.   </p>
<p>You want to hold my g*n?   </p>
<p>Y-You can. (CHUCKLES)   </p>
<p>Thanks. I was hoping maybe you could point me   </p>
<p>- to the church in town.<br />
- Church?   </p>
<p>Yeah, straight down this street.<br />
First steeple you see.   </p>
<p>That is not it.<br />
That's the Eiffel Tower strip club.   </p>
<p>They have a French onion soup that is, uh, well, it's just okay.   </p>
<p>And I guess that's about all.   </p>
<p>(OVERLAPPING SHOUTING)   </p>
<p>You shall bore me no more! (GRUNTS)   </p>
<p>You're going the wrong way!   </p>
<p>No, I-I want to go this way. I love God.   </p>
<p>If you love him so much, why don't you marry him?   </p>
<p>Penny. Button.   </p>
<p>IOU for one penny.   </p>
<p>Hi. Bode Wright.   </p>
<p>Recovery meetings are downstairs.   </p>
<p>Booze to the right, huffers to the left.   </p>
<p>Sorry, I'm here about the ad.<br />
On Christslist?   </p>
<p>About you guys needing a-a youth pastor?   </p>
<p>I didn't place any ad.   </p>
<p>I placed the ad.   </p>
<p>(LOVEJOY GROANS)   </p>
<p>- I'm Bode.<br />
- Bode. Nice cross.   </p>
<p>Tim's are chewed to nubs.   </p>
<p>I-I chew my crosses. Nervous habit.   </p>
<p>Do you have any experience, Bode?   </p>
<p>I used to work in Michigan.   </p>
<p>Had to use bottled holy water.<br />
(CHUCKLES)   </p>
<p>Uh-huh. Education?   </p>
<p>I, uh, have a master's in divinity with a focus on biblical languages.   </p>
<p>- Greek, Hebrew...<br />
- You're hired.   </p>
<p>Up-bup-bup-bup-bup!<br />
It doesn't work that fast.   </p>
<p>We have I- s and W- s, collar fittings.   </p>
<p>And, besides, <em>I'm</em> the one in charge.   </p>
<p>In the end, isn't God in charge here?   </p>
<p>Do you see Jimmy Buffett at every Jimmy Buffett café?   </p>
<p>I don't think so.   </p>
<p>Hey, can I have this? Marge could use it to serve me snacks while I'm on the toilet.   </p>
<p>- Oh, just take it.<br />
- So, Bode,   </p>
<p>- do you have anywhere to stay?<br />
- Not yet.   </p>
<p>I saw a motel by the tire fire.   </p>
<p>- He'll stay with us.<br />
- No way.   </p>
<p>Uh, Reverend? The homeless are here for their foot washing.   </p>
<p>I'm looking for a mani-pedi and an eyebrow wax.   </p>
<p>I guess I could use a little help around here.   </p>
<p>Thank you. I won't let you down.   </p>
<p>We don't hug here.   </p>
<p>HELEN: Mmm.   </p>
<p>Uh, I'm here for the Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.    </p>
<p>It's usually me, Lenny, Carl, Bumblebee Man, Kent Brockman.    </p>
<p>But don't tell anyone.    </p>
<p>Downstairs to the right.    </p>
<p>Also, Lunchlady Dora, King Toot, and a man I'll identify as Disco S.    </p>
<p>Disco S is quite a mess.    </p>
<p>- _<br />
- Hmm.    </p>
<p>Oh, Marge, this is embarrassing.    </p>
<p>We don't need counseling.    </p>
<p>We<em> do</em> need counseling.    </p>
<p>I'm carrying a lot of anger.    </p>
<p>Just do what I do. Come home and have a hot dinner waiting for you.    </p>
<p>- (MARGE GROANS)<br />
- Well, let me just say that I go into this with no preconceptions.    </p>
<p>Now, tell me, how is this Homer's fault?    </p>
<p>- He sold our home without telling me.<br />
- (GRUNTS)    </p>
<p>- (TOY TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS)<br />
- Helen, is he playing with my damn trains?    </p>
<p>Excuse me. There's trouble down at Lovejoy Junction.    </p>
<p>So, we're good?    </p>
<p>We're good if we get our house back.    </p>
<p>Did you say houseboat?    </p>
<p>House<em> back.</em> House back!    </p>
<p>Oh.    </p>
<p>(GROANING)    </p>
<p>(SNORING)    </p>
<p>(CHOKES, COUGHS)    </p>
<p>Sorry, Reverend.<br />
I'm trying to get some rest?    </p>
<p>The   :   to Trenton doesn't stop just because your fat head's on the track.    </p>
<p>- What are you doing?<br />
- Nothing.    </p>
<p>- You gonna drop that?<br />
- Not doing a thing.    </p>
<p>As a gag, you're gonna drop a tiny log on my face?    </p>
<p>- Nothing.<br />
- As I'm sleeping? That's, that's-that's funny.    </p>
<p>- Nothing. Nothing.<br />
- Go ahead. Drop it.    </p>
<p>- Drop a tiny log on me.<br />
- Not doing a thing.    </p>
<p>Is that... Is that your plan?<br />
You're gonna drop that?    </p>
<p>Look, we're both grown men here.    </p>
<p>Now leave my choo choo alone.    </p>
<p>Gladly.    </p>
<p>Aah!    </p>
<p>Glad I finally got to use that.    </p>
<p>Now, my sleepy, young friend,    </p>
<p>I don't know how you did things back in &quot;Michigan.&quot;    </p>
<p>Air quotes are for when something's not a real thing.    </p>
<p>But in my parish, we minister to our flock.    </p>
<p>And I'm not afraid to say the hard things that need to be said.    </p>
<p>&quot;I&quot;   .    </p>
<p>- What?<br />
- What did he say?    </p>
<p>We can't hear you.    </p>
<p>&quot;B&quot; thr-three. (COUGHS)    </p>
<p>You know, I'd be happy to yell out numbers for you.    </p>
<p>Help save your voice.    </p>
<p>Bingo requires a firm, experienced caller.    </p>
<p>(VOICE CRACKS, CLEARS THROAT): &quot;G.&quot;<br />
&quot;G&quot;   .    </p>
<p>(COUGHING): &quot;N&quot; for... &quot;N&quot;   .    </p>
<p>I got nothing.    </p>
<p>(COUGHING)    </p>
<p>I think I can handle it.    </p>
<p>When I was in seminary school,    </p>
<p>I was the shouty guy on our rowing team.    </p>
<p>(WHISPERS):<br />
We weren't allowed to say &quot;coxswain.&quot;    </p>
<p>(COUGHS) Bingo is not for newbies.    </p>
<p>The letters sound very similar.    </p>
<p>&quot;B&quot;   .    </p>
<p>&quot;B&quot; as in Balthazar.    </p>
<p>Did he say Galthazar?    </p>
<p>Gingo!    </p>
<p>Gingo take you to bathroom.    </p>
<p>I don't want to go.    </p>
<p>Hey, this no picnic for Gingo either.    </p>
<p>Empty again.    </p>
<p>And those two just came here to make out.    </p>
<p>(MOANING)    </p>
<p>If we do it in a church, I, like, can't get pregnant.    </p>
<p>(MOANING)    </p>
<p>Uh, good mor... (CLEARS THROAT, COUGHS)    </p>
<p>Excuse me.    </p>
<p>(CLEARS THROAT)    </p>
<p>(COUGHING)    </p>
<p>(GROANING)    </p>
<p>Brothers and sisters,    </p>
<p>Reverend Lovejoy is experiencing some vocal difficulties.    </p>
<p>(GRUNTS, COUGHS)    </p>
<p>Save your voice, Reverend.    </p>
<p>Now, we could cancel church.    </p>
<p>(EXCITED CHATTER)    </p>
<p>(PLAYING &quot;MAPLE LEAF RAG&quot;)    </p>
<p>But God clearly foresaw this and sent us a backup pastor to finish the service.    </p>
<p>(CONGREGATION GROANS)    </p>
<p><em>Church will not be canceled.</em>    </p>
<p>(SOBBING)    </p>
<p>Now please help me welcome our new youth minister Bode Wright.    </p>
<p>(CONFUSED CHATTER)    </p>
<p>Thanks. That's very meek. Jesus would've loved it.    </p>
<p>I was thinking, while the reverend rests his voice, maybe we could all sing a song.    </p>
<p>Uh, Rev, if that's okay with you, um, cough once.    </p>
<p>(COUGHS TWICE)    </p>
<p>We did not establish what two coughs means, so I'll take that to mean two yeses.    </p>
<p>(CONGREGATION LAUGHS)    </p>
<p>Why don't we sing, I don't know,    </p>
<p>&quot;Amazing Grace&quot;? You all know that one.    </p>
<p>Or if you don't, it's in your hymnal under    </p>
<p>&quot;grace, comma, amazing.&quot;    </p>
<p>(PLAYING &quot;AMAZING GRACE&quot;)    </p>
<p>♪ <em>Amazing grace, how sweet the sound</em> ♪    </p>
<p>♪ <em>That saved a wretch like me</em> ♪    </p>
<p>♪ <em>I once was lost but now I'm found</em> ♪    </p>
<p>♪ <em>'Twas blind, but now I see.</em> ♪    </p>
<p>This is the most exciting thing that ever happened in a white church!    </p>
<p>All these years of mediocre grace.    </p>
<p>Finally, it's amazing.    </p>
<p>This must've been what it was like at Jesus's concerts.    </p>
<p>(ELECTRIC GUITAR PLAYING)    </p>
<p>Thank you. Now we'd, uh, we'd like to do a couple of new psalms.    </p>
<p>(CROWD BOOS)    </p>
<p>- ♪<em> Hallelujah, hallelu</em> ♪<br />
- ♪<em> Hallelujah</em> ♪    </p>
<p>♪ <em>Hallelujah, hallelu</em> ♪    </p>
<p>♪ <em>Hallelujah.</em> ♪    </p>
<p>Something exciting's happening at the church.    </p>
<p>Let's check it out.    </p>
<p>All right, I think we get it.<br />
Grace, it's amazing.    </p>
<p>I know most of you usually save your &quot;hallelujahs&quot; for when church is over.    </p>
<p>(LAUGHS) I adore the informality.    </p>
<p>But if it's okay, I thought maybe I could just speak to you guys straight from my heart.    </p>
<p>I don't have anything planned, but I guess I should talk about God, right?    </p>
<p>Church. Pastor.    </p>
<p>Makes sense I should talk about God.    </p>
<p>But the truth is, I woke up this morning and I wasn't really sure if I believed in God.    </p>
<p>(CONGREGATION GASPS)    </p>
<p>No God?    </p>
<p>Fingers in your ears, boys.    </p>
<p>Till you can feel the brain.    </p>
<p>It's okay. Everything's fine.    </p>
<p>I-I just woke up with some doubt.    </p>
<p>Like many of you did, too, I'm sure.    </p>
<p>There's so much pain and suffering in the world,    </p>
<p>I wasn't sure anyone was really out there.    </p>
<p>Watching us. On a cloud.    </p>
<p>That's how we think of God, right?    </p>
<p>To many of us, God is just an angry, old miser with a k*ll surveillance system.    </p>
<p>Everyone picks on the miser.    </p>
<p>Shave faster or no tip!    </p>
<p>Oh, I shave-a faster, all right.    </p>
<p>Hurry up. I'm going to a funeral.    </p>
<p>Oh, you're going to a funeral, all right.    </p>
<p>Oh, this is taking too long.    </p>
<p>I got to stop procrastinating.    </p>
<p>Then I got quiet and thought about it.    </p>
<p>It hit me that maybe God isn't up there, you know.    </p>
<p>&quot;Somewhere else.&quot;    </p>
<p>Maybe God's right here and now.    </p>
<p>As close as the air on your skin.    </p>
<p>For the first time ever, I don't feel alone.    </p>
<p>Life is worth living.    </p>
<p>Hey, forget that hit I called on myself, huh?    </p>
<p>Yeah, well, I said too late.    </p>
<p>Can't you just charge me a stalking fee?    </p>
<p>Okay,   %.    </p>
<p>And you can only cancel on the app.    </p>
<p>All right, I-I'll just, uh...    </p>
<p>My screen is frozen!    </p>
<p>Maybe God is just a word for a love that we create and remember together.    </p>
<p>A love that isn't mad at us for our doubt or angry at us because we're alcoholics.    </p>
<p>(SIGHS)    </p>
<p>Finally, recognized for my accomplishments.    </p>
<p>I think so many of us have made a God that's like us, instead of the other way around.    </p>
<p>God loves diversity.    </p>
<p>God didn't just make one type of flower.    </p>
<p>He made thousands of different flowers... roses, lilies, orchids... and He made the weeds, too.    </p>
<p>But He loves all of them indiscriminately.    </p>
<p>Just like the bees.    </p>
<p>You have made this bumblebee a humble bee.    </p>
<p>Jesus said, &quot;Let the weeds grow with the wheat.&quot;    </p>
<p>That means it's all in the game.    </p>
<p>Go easy on yourself.    </p>
<p>You don't have to earn God's love.    </p>
<p>You<em> are</em> God's love.    </p>
<p>All right, that's it.    </p>
<p>I know it's early, but it's a beautiful day.    </p>
<p>Let's get out of here.    </p>
<p>Sorry, concert's over, dude.    </p>
<p>All that's left is the merch.    </p>
<p>(CHANTING): Bode! Bode! Bode!    </p>
<p>CONGREGATION (CHANTING): Bode!<br />
Bode! Bode!    </p>
<p>Three cheers for Reverend Lovejoy.    </p>
<p>Stupid Flanders.    </p>

<p>CONGREGATION: Stupid Flanders!    </p>
<p>Stupid Flanders!    </p>
<p>I love church.    </p>
<p>I won't be single in Heaven.    </p>
<p>This was the best church ever.    </p>
<p>It was like some kind of religious experience.    </p>
<p>Will you join us for pancakes?    </p>
<p>Are those new vestments?    </p>
<p>They really bring out the piety.    </p>
<p>You don't have to patronize me, Ned.    </p>
<p>You're, y-you're right, I'm sorry.    </p>
<p>Y-You did not do well today.    </p>
<p>Oh, go back to patronizing.    </p>
<p>Maybe something about my shoes?    </p>
<p>Oh, look at those shoes, tied so tight with loops so even.    </p>
<p>Someone knows the bunny ear technique.    </p>
<p>Helen tied them.    </p>
<p>Uh, Pastor, would you like to say grace?    </p>
<p>(CLEARS THROAT) Lord...    </p>
<p>Oh, sorry, I should have been more specific.    </p>
<p>I meant the cool new pastor everyone likes.    </p>
<p>(LAUGHS) You can sit down.    </p>
<p>You know, I think the food is good without me saying it's good.    </p>
<p>God made it good.    </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, it's nice to be thankful, but there's no need to make everyone uncomfortable by praying in front of 'em, am I right?    </p>
<p>Nice speech, although longer than grace.    </p>
<p>Oh, no bacon for me.    </p>
<p>I'm a vegetarian. (CHUCKLES)    </p>
<p>And, actually, a Buddhist.    </p>
<p>Great. I love Buddha.    </p>
<p>That's where I got my name.    </p>
<p>The Bodhi Tree.    </p>
<p>And I don't eat meat either.    </p>
<p>You're a vegetarian?    </p>
<p>- What about evolution?<br />
- Into it.    </p>
<p>- Gay rights?<br />
- Love is love.    </p>
<p>- Dizzy or Bird?<br />
- John Coltrane and Duke Ellington,     .    </p>
<p>(GASPS) The only way to describe how perfect that jazz answer is, is with jazz.    </p>
<p>This brunch has turned into... a jazz brunch!    </p>
<p>I'm a believer.    </p>
<p>That's great, Lisa, but I actually don't think faith comes down to what we believe.    </p>
<p>Well, you got to believe in this baloney.    </p>
<p>That's how you get into Heaven.    </p>
<p>Where maybe, just maybe, I could see the mother that abandoned me again.    </p>
<p>_    </p>
<p>Yeah, sure, but I think together we can bring Heaven here while we're still alive.    </p>
<p>There's a Chinese proverb about Heaven and Hell.    </p>
<p>They say Hell is a long table like this, full of food, but everybody's starving because they have these long chopsticks, like pool cues, and they can't bring the food to their mouths.    </p>
<p>This is the worst Year of the Ox ever.    </p>
<p>But in the proverb, Heaven is the exact same table, same food, same long chopsticks, but everybody's happy and fat because they're feeding each other.    </p>
<p>CONGREGATION: Aw!    </p>
<p>Wait, wait! I can be cool, too... with humor.    </p>
<p>Did you hear the one about the Greek-Jewish wedding?    </p>
<p>They didn't know whether to break the plates or the glasses!    </p>
<p>(CONGREGATION BOOING)    </p>
<p>Yes, why don't you take your cultural insensitivity back to the Spanish Inquisition you came from?    </p>
<p>I've lost them.    </p>
<p>You never had us.    </p>
<p>Timothy, the church council wants to thank you for your many years of...    </p>
<p>Incompetence!    </p>
<p>(GASPS)    </p>
<p>Knock his frock off.    </p>
<p>We like the new guy in his tight jeans.    </p>
<p>Do not resuscitate your career.    </p>
<p>What are you saying? You're firing me?    </p>
<p>- Gingo.<br />
- Please surrender your cross.    </p>
<p>We don't want any trouble.    </p>
<p>Timothy.    </p>
<p>Now the collar.    </p>
<p>And any water you turned into holy water is once again regular water.    </p>
<p>Nothing but tap.    </p>
<p>Did you know Bode has   ,    YouTube subscribers?    </p>
<p>Our church could go viral.    </p>
<p>Ugh. Close window.    </p>
<p>- You just subscribed.<br />
- What? No.    </p>
<p>(CHUCKLES):<br />
Now you gave him a thumbs-up.    </p>
<p>Stop telling me what I just did.    </p>
<p>You just gave him an eggplant emoji.    </p>
<p>Well, at least that can't be misconstrued.    </p>
<p>Wait a minute.    </p>
<p>The Internet can help me.<br />
Help me find something on him.    </p>
<p>He's clean on Google.    </p>
<p>I'll have to try Bing.    </p>
<p><em>Sorry, I was asleep.</em>    </p>
<p><em>Do you really want to use us?</em>    </p>
<p>Yes.    </p>
<p>Hmm. Nothing.    </p>
<p>But I'm not licked.    </p>
<p>Pack your bags, Helen.    </p>
<p>We are going to Michigan.    </p>
<p>Reverend?<br />
We're here for a little counseling?    </p>
<p>Well, I'd be happy to.    </p>
<p>But you're already with the best counselor there is.    </p>
<p>- Your partner.<br />
- Wait.    </p>
<p>But Marge always told me communication is bad for a marriage.    </p>
<p>I said it was good.    </p>
<p>You said what was good?    </p>
<p>You just have to know what it's like to be in each other's shoes.    </p>
<p>Literally. Put on each other's shoes.    </p>
<p>Right now.    </p>
<p>HOMER: All right. They...    </p>
<p>(GRUNTING)    </p>
<p>Your shoes are so tight.    </p>
<p>And you do so much work.    </p>
<p>You're an angel.    </p>
<p>And your shoes are so heavy.    </p>
<p>I never realized you carried around so much.    </p>
<p>I'm starting to see the man I fell in love with again.    </p>
<p>Where? Where? I'll k*ll him!    </p>
<p>- You.<br />
- Oh.    </p>
<p>I must admit, this is amazing.    </p>
<p>But what about the fact that he sold our house?    </p>
<p>- Um, may I interject?<br />
- Sure.    </p>
<p>I've seen your house.<br />
It'll never pass inspection.    </p>
<p>- Are you sure?<br />
- Piece of crap.    </p>
<p>Thank you, Reverend. Mmm, mmm.    </p>
<p>Lisa. What brings you here?    </p>
<p>Well, I thought it might be fun if we meditate together.    </p>
<p>Sure. Make yourself at<em> om.</em>    </p>
<p>(LAUGHS): Wow! As meditation jokes go...    </p>
<p>That's the only meditation joke I've ever heard.    </p>
<p>Alexa, play Meditation Jam.    </p>
<p>(NEW AGE MUSIC PLAYING)    </p>
<p>You know, science calls it consciousness, the mystics call it a soul, but both are just words, just labels, for whatever it is that's looking out your eyes right now.    </p>
<p>(INHALES) Breathe, Lisa.    </p>
<p><em>(&quot;IN A SENTIMENTAL MOOD&quot; PLAYING)</em>    </p>

<p>Saw the button, huh?    </p>
<p>(GASPS) I did.    </p>
<p><em>HELEN: Tim,</em> we could go to Mackinac Island.    </p>
<p>They have the longest hotel porch in the world.    </p>
<p>It's always the big verandas with you, isn't it, Helen?    </p>
<p>You've done something to this town    </p>
<p>I never thought could happen.    </p>
<p>A full-blown religious revival.    </p>
<p>Yeah, let these warm your insides as the words of St. Paul warm your soul, there.    </p>
<p>(CLEARS THROAT) Dear Ephesians... and I'm, of course, paraphrasing here... believe in Christ or I'll hit your head with a baseball bat.    </p>
<p>I'll frickin' do it.    </p>
<p>- Amen.<br />
- Amen.    </p>
<p>(CHUCKLES): Hey, I'm-I'm not trying to change any minds.    </p>
<p>I'm just trying to start a conversation.    </p>
<p>We need that.<br />
This town's like a snow globe.    </p>
<p>It doesn't look like much till you shake it up a little.    </p>
<p>- (WHIMPERS)<br />
- I want redemption or else, dude.    </p>
<p>Or else what?    </p>
<p>Or Rabbi Mankiewicz will, dude.    </p>
<p>And I have trouble making that &quot;cch&quot; sound.    </p>
<p>It's either Chanukah or Hanukkah.    </p>
<p>Okay? Pick one of those.    </p>
<p>(EXHALES)    </p>
<p>Teach a man to microfiche, and you'll feed him dirt for a lifetime.    </p>
<p>Vengeance is mine, sayeth the me.    </p>
<p>We really should've digitized that stuff.    </p>
<p>Oh, I hope part two is about my rescue.    </p>

<p>You, sir, have challenged me on scripture.    </p>
<p>Oh, well, if it's scripture you want to talk, then let us make a joyful noise    </p>
<p>- unto the Lord.<br />
- Good.    </p>
