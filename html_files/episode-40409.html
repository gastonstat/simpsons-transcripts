<p>Uh, tell me about that night.</p>
<p>I was at the buffet when I heard a woman scream, &quot;Abe, don't!&quot; then a splash.</p>
<p>What did you do next?</p>
<p> I saw they were refilling the shrimp tower, so I had to get over there and touch them all.</p>
<p>&quot;Abe, don't.&quot;   </p>
<p>Whatever could Vivienne have meant by that?</p>
<p> Naturally, the police questioned Abe Simpson.</p>
<p>His only defense?</p>
<p>&quot;I don't remember.&quot;   </p>
<p>The old man would not confess.Rude.</p>
<p>So we swabbed his hands to see if they tested positive for pushing.</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I don't care what it looks like.</p>
<p>I know Abe.</p>
<p>He would never do something so horrible.</p>
<p>I did something so horrible.</p>
<p>I finally listened to that dad-gum podcast...</p>
<p>(CRYING)</p>
<p> ...and it convinced me I'm a k*ll.</p>

<p>You're under arrest for spoiling the ending!</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p> Abraham Simpson, as you have pled guilty to the m*rder of Vivienne Saint Charmaine, I'm giving you life in prison.</p>
<p>And I'm giving your podcast five stars but no comment.</p>

<p><em>(CELL DOOR SLAMS)</em>  </p>
<p> Why did you confess, Dad?</p>
<p> A majority of the family believes you're innocent.</p>
<p>But what that Kent Brockman said about me was so darn convincing.</p>
<p>I began to suspect myself around episode four.</p>
<p>Then by episode six, it seemed like it was that hot-tempered deckhand.</p>
<p>But by episode nine, I knew I'd done it, just as sure as shampoo shuttle is the future of hair care.</p>
<p>We can't give up hope.</p>
<p>I know Grampa's situation looks bad, with the insurance money, what Mrs.</p>
<p>Skinner heard, but...</p>
<p>And the confession didn't help, either, but-but...</p>

<p>But-but-but...</p>

<p>- I think Grampa might have done it.</p>
<p>He might have.</p>
<p>He totally might have.</p>
<p>- (BOTH CRYING)</p>
<p>- Oh, no.</p>
<p>With all our true crime training, how could we have missed this?</p>
<p> We've become the people that we hate most: the family members too deluded to see the obvious truth.</p>
<p>Uh, for the record, I was willing to believe he was the m*rder back when there was no evidence.</p>

<p>Welcome, listeners around the world and our proud astronauts downloading in the darkness of space.</p>
<p>Tonight we both wrap up and drag out the story of<em> Guilty Grampa.</em>  </p>
<p>You'll get a chance to hear from the hottest stars of this heinous crime.</p>
<p>We love you, someone else's tragedy!</p>
<p> And I'm thrilled to announce the<em> Guilty Grampa</em> streaming series, starring the Skarsgard </p>

<p>- (CROWD CHEERING)</p>
<p> I only have a deal memo.</p>
<p>I haven't signed the final paperwork.</p>
<p>Kent, there's something you've got to know.</p>
<p>Something everyone's got to know.</p>
<p>On the day of Vivienne's disappearance, she and Abe went in for a couple's colonoscopy.</p>
<p>- They each swallowed a tiny intestopod, </p>
<p>- (BEEPING)</p>
<p> which records internal data and broadcasts a precise GPS signal for    hours.</p>
<p>- You can see here.</p>
<p>- (BEEPING)</p>
<p> Once Vivienne fell off the boat, she moved directly to shore.</p>
<p>She didn't sink.</p>
<p>She swam.</p>
<p>Vivienne's signal then traveled south to a resort in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, where the guacamole is made table-side.</p>
<p>Vivienne is alive.</p>
<p>She faked her death.</p>
<p>Which means Grampa didn't k*ll anyone.</p>
<p>But your podcast convinced him that he did.</p>
<p>I wanted to say that part.</p>
<p>Well, that's, uh, that's all very interesting, but it doesn't really fit with the title of my podcast, to say nothing of the merch.</p>
<p>(CHANTING): <em>Guilty Grampa! Guilty Grampa!</em>    </p>
<p>You sent me to jail.</p>
<p>You're no journalist.</p>
<p>(BABY TALKING): You made us a m*rder.</p>

<p>I have a confession to make.</p>
<p>Guilty Grampa is not guilty.</p>
<p>- (CROWD GASPS)</p>
<p>- (EXCLAIMS)</p>
<p> Oh, we all wish he did it.</p>
<p>Everyone here loves DNA swabs, cell phone pings and spatter analysis, that fantasy that the bad guys will be caught and the police will save the day.</p>
<p>Geez.</p>
<p>That's a lot to put on a guy.</p>
<p>From now on, I will report with judicious restraint, leaving behind sensational revelations in favor of painstakingly accumulated uncertainties.</p>
<p>And I know you will all come along with me on this slow, measured ride.</p>
<p><em>TABITHA: And with that out-of-touch statement,</em> <em>Kent Brockman bid a big fat farewell</em> <em>to his relevancy.</em> </p>
<p>(GRAMPA GROANS)</p>
<p> Come on, Dad, cheer up.</p>
<p>You're an innocent man.</p>
<p>Or so you'd have us believe.</p>
<p>I thought Vivienne loved me, but she played me for a sap.</p>
<p>Why'd you set me up, baby?</p>
<p> Well, if it makes you feel any better, I never believed she liked you for one second.</p>
